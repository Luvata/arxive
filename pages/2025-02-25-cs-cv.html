<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Asperti, Franky George, Tiberio Marras, Razvan Ciprian Stricescu, Fabio Zanotti</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, advancements in generative artificial intelligence have led to the development of sophisticated tools capable of mimicking diverse artistic styles, opening new possibilities for digital creativity and artistic expression. This paper presents a critical assessment of the style replication capabilities of contemporary generative models, evaluating their strengths and limitations across multiple dimensions. We examine how effectively these models reproduce traditional artistic styles while maintaining structural integrity and compositional balance in the generated images.
  The analysis is based on a new large dataset of AI-generated works imitating artistic styles of the past, holding potential for a wide range of applications: the "AI-pastiche" dataset.
  The study is supported by extensive user surveys, collecting diverse opinions on the dataset and investigation both technical and aesthetic challenges, including the ability to generate outputs that are realistic and visually convincing, the versatility of models in handling a wide range of artistic styles, and the extent to which they adhere to the content and stylistic specifications outlined in prompts.
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of generative tools in style replication, offering insights into their technical and artistic limitations, potential advancements in model design and training methodologies, and emerging opportunities for enhancing digital artistry, human-AI collaboration, and the broader creative landscape.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15885">DOEI: Dual Optimization of Embedding Information for Attention-Enhanced Class Activation Maps</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjie Zhu, Zeyu Zhang, Guansong Pang, Xu Wang, Shimin Wen, Yu Bai, Daji Ergu, Ying Cai, Yang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) typically utilizes limited semantic annotations to obtain initial Class Activation Maps (CAMs). However, due to the inadequate coupling between class activation responses and semantic information in high-dimensional space, the CAM is prone to object co-occurrence or under-activation, resulting in inferior recognition accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose DOEI, Dual Optimization of Embedding Information, a novel approach that reconstructs embedding representations through semantic-aware attention weight matrices to optimize the expression capability of embedding information. Specifically, DOEI amplifies tokens with high confidence and suppresses those with low confidence during the class-to-patch interaction. This alignment of activation responses with semantic information strengthens the propagation and decoupling of target features, enabling the generated embeddings to more accurately represent target features in high-level semantic space. In addition, we propose a hybrid-feature alignment module in DOEI that combines RGB values, embedding-guided features, and self-attention weights to increase the reliability of candidate tokens. Comprehensive experiments show that DOEI is an effective plug-and-play module that empowers state-of-the-art visual transformer-based WSSS models to significantly improve the quality of CAMs and segmentation performance on popular benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC (+3.6%, +1.5%, +1.2% mIoU) and MS COCO (+1.2%, +1.6% mIoU).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiying Peng, Kaiyuan Li, Weichen Zhang, Chen Gao, Xinlei Chen, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D-LLMs, which combine point-cloud encoders with large models, have been proposed to tackle complex tasks in embodied intelligence and scene understanding. In addition to showing promising results on 3D tasks, we found that they are significantly affected by hallucinations. For instance, they may generate objects that do not exist in the scene or produce incorrect relationships between objects. To investigate this issue, this work presents the first systematic study of hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. We begin by quickly evaluating hallucinations in several representative 3D-LLMs and reveal that they are all significantly affected by hallucinations. We then define hallucinations in 3D scenes and, through a detailed analysis of datasets, uncover the underlying causes of these hallucinations. We find three main causes: (1) Uneven frequency distribution of objects in the dataset. (2) Strong correlations between objects. (3) Limited diversity in object attributes. Additionally, we propose new evaluation metrics for hallucinations, including Random Point Cloud Pair and Opposite Question Evaluations, to assess whether the model generates responses based on visual information and aligns it with the text's meaning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Zhao, Guande He, Yixiao Chen, Hongzhou Zhu, Chongxuan Li, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled models to synthesize high-quality, minute-long videos. However, generating even longer videos with temporal coherence remains a major challenge, and existing length extrapolation methods lead to temporal repetition or motion deceleration. In this work, we systematically analyze the role of frequency components in positional embeddings and identify an intrinsic frequency that primarily governs extrapolation behavior. Based on this insight, we propose RIFLEx, a minimal yet effective approach that reduces the intrinsic frequency to suppress repetition while preserving motion consistency, without requiring any additional modifications. RIFLEx offers a true free lunch--achieving high-quality $2\times$ extrapolation on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers in a completely training-free manner. Moreover, it enhances quality and enables $3\times$ extrapolation by minimal fine-tuning without long videos.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Umair Danish, Madhushan Buwaneswaran, Tehara Fonseka, Katarina Grolinger</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing impact of human-induced climate change and unplanned urban constructions has increased flooding incidents in recent years. Accurate identification of flooded areas is crucial for effective disaster management and urban planning. While few works have utilized convolutional neural networks and transformer-based semantic segmentation techniques for identifying flooded areas from aerial footage, recent developments in graph neural networks have created improvement opportunities. This paper proposes an innovative approach, the Graph Attention Convolutional U-NET (GAC-UNET) model, based on graph neural networks for automated identification of flooded areas. The model incorporates a graph attention mechanism and Chebyshev layers into the U-Net architecture. Furthermore, this paper explores the applicability of transfer learning and model reprogramming to enhance the accuracy of flood area segmentation models. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GAC-UNET model, outperforms other approaches with 91\% mAP, 94\% dice score, and 89\% IoU, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making and better planning of future infrastructures in flood-prone areas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas M Metz, Matthew Q Hill, Blake Myers, Veda Nandan Gandi, Rahul Chilakapati, Alice J O'Toole</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term body identification algorithms have emerged recently with the increased availability of high-quality training data. We seek to fill knowledge gaps about these models by analyzing body image embeddings from four body identification networks trained with 1.9 million images across 4,788 identities and 9 databases. By analyzing a diverse range of architectures (ViT, SWIN-ViT, CNN, and linguistically primed CNN), we first show that the face contributes to the accuracy of body identification algorithms and that these algorithms can identify faces to some extent -- with no explicit face training. Second, we show that representations (embeddings) generated by body identification algorithms encode information about gender, as well as image-based information including view (yaw) and even the dataset from which the image originated. Third, we demonstrate that identification accuracy can be improved without additional training by operating directly and selectively on the learned embedding space. Leveraging principal component analysis (PCA), identity comparisons were consistently more accurate in subspaces that eliminated dimensions that explained large amounts of variance. These three findings were surprisingly consistent across architectures and test datasets. This work represents the first analysis of body representations produced by long-term re-identification networks trained on challenging unconstrained datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report reviews recent advancements in human motion prediction, reconstruction, and generation. Human motion prediction focuses on forecasting future poses and movements from historical data, addressing challenges like nonlinear dynamics, occlusions, and motion style variations. Reconstruction aims to recover accurate 3D human body movements from visual inputs, often leveraging transformer-based architectures, diffusion models, and physical consistency losses to handle noise and complex poses. Motion generation synthesizes realistic and diverse motions from action labels, textual descriptions, or environmental constraints, with applications in robotics, gaming, and virtual avatars. Additionally, text-to-motion generation and human-object interaction modeling have gained attention, enabling fine-grained and context-aware motion synthesis for augmented reality and robotics. This review highlights key methodologies, datasets, challenges, and future research directions driving progress in these fields.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15969">Forgotten Polygons: Multimodal Large Language Models are Shape-Blind</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> William Rudman, Michal Golovanesky, Amir Bar, Vedant Palit, Yann LeCun, Carsten Eickhoff, Ritambhara Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance across various multimodal tasks. However, their effectiveness in cross-cultural contexts remains limited due to the predominantly Western-centric nature of existing data and models. Meanwhile, multi-agent models have shown strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in a multi-agent interaction setting for the novel task of multicultural image generation. Our key contributions are: (1) We introduce MosAIG, a Multi-Agent framework that enhances multicultural Image Generation by leveraging LLMs with distinct cultural personas; (2) We provide a dataset of 9,000 multicultural images spanning five countries, three age groups, two genders, 25 historical landmarks, and five languages; and (3) We demonstrate that multi-agent interactions outperform simple, no-agent models across multiple evaluation metrics, offering valuable insights for future research.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an improved and modified partial differential equation (PDE)-based de-hazing algorithm. The proposed method combines logarithmic image processing models in a PDE formulation refined with linear filter-based operators in either spatial or frequency domain. Additionally, a fast, simplified de-hazing function approximation of the hazy image formation model is developed in combination with fuzzy homomorphic refinement. The proposed algorithm solves the problem of image darkening and over-enhancement of edges in addition to enhancement of dark image regions encountered in previous formulations. This is in addition to avoiding enhancement of sky regions in de-hazed images while avoiding halo effect. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is utilized for underwater and dust storm image enhancement with the incorporation of a modified global contrast enhancement algorithm. Experimental comparisons indicate that the proposed approach surpasses a majority of the algorithms from the literature based on quantitative image quality metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prashant Shekhar, Bidur Devkota, Dumindu Samaraweera, Laxima Niure Kandel, Manoj Babu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models, particularly in safety-critical applications like healthcare and autonomous driving. Recently, patch based attacks have demonstrated effectiveness in real-time inference scenarios owing to their 'drag and drop' nature. Following this idea for Semantic Segmentation (SS), here we propose a novel Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) based adversarial patch attack that is more realistic for autonomous vehicles. To effectively train this attack we also propose a 'simplified' loss function that is easy to analyze and implement. Using this attack as our basis, we investigate whether adversarial patches once optimized on a specific SS model, can fool other models or architectures. We conduct a comprehensive cross-model transferability analysis of adversarial patches trained on SOTA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such PIDNet-S, PIDNet-M and PIDNet-L, among others. Additionally, we also include the Segformer model to study transferability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). All of our analysis is conducted on the widely used Cityscapes dataset. Our study reveals key insights into how model architectures (CNN vs CNN or CNN vs. Transformer-based) influence attack susceptibility. In particular, we conclude that although the transferability (effectiveness) of attacks on unseen images of any dimension is really high, the attacks trained against one particular model are minimally effective on other models. And this was found to be true for both ViT and CNN based models. Additionally our results also indicate that for CNN-based models, the repercussions of patch attacks are local, unlike ViTs. Per-class analysis reveals that simple-classes like 'sky' suffer less misclassification than others.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mike Ranzinger, Greg Heinrich, Pavlo Molchanov, Jan Kautz, Bryan Catanzaro, Andrew Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Technological advancements in soccer have surged over the past decade, transforming aspects of the sport. Unlike binary rules, many soccer regulations, such as the "Offside Rule," rely on subjective interpretation rather than straightforward True or False criteria. The on-field referee holds ultimate authority in adjudicating these nuanced decisions. A significant breakthrough in soccer officiating is the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system, leveraging a network of 20-30 cameras within stadiums to minimize human errors. VAR's operational scope typically encompasses 10-30 cameras, ensuring high decision accuracy but at a substantial cost. This report proposes an innovative approach to offside detection using a single camera, such as the broadcasting camera, to mitigate expenses associated with sophisticated technological setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijun Yan, Churan Wang, Fangwei Zhong, Yizhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a potent diagnostic tool for detecting pathological tissues in various diseases. Different MRI sequences have different contrast mechanisms and sensitivities for different types of lesions, which pose challenges to accurate and consistent lesion segmentation. In clinical practice, radiologists commonly use the sub-sequence feature, i.e. the difference between post contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (post) and pre-contrast-enhanced (pre) sequences, to locate lesions. Inspired by this, we propose a residual fusion method to learn subsequence representation for MRI lesion segmentation. Specifically, we iteratively and adaptively fuse features from pre- and post-contrast sequences at multiple resolutions, using dynamic weights to achieve optimal fusion and address diverse lesion enhancement patterns. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on BraTS2023 dataset for brain tumor segmentation and our in-house breast MRI dataset for breast lesion segmentation. Our method is clinically inspired and has the potential to facilitate lesion segmentation in various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Abhulimhen, Negash Begashaw, Gurcan Comert, Chunheng Zhao, Pierluigi Pisu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, particularly in fields such as image classification. However, DNNs are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations are introduced to input images, leading to erroneous model outputs. In today's digital era, ensuring the security and integrity of images processed by DNNs is of critical importance. One of the most prominent adversarial attack methods is the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), which perturbs images in the direction of the loss gradient to deceive the model.
  This paper presents a novel approach for detecting and filtering FGSM adversarial attacks in image processing tasks. Our proposed method evaluates 10,000 images, each subjected to five different levels of perturbation, characterized by $\epsilon$ values of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2. These perturbations are applied in the direction of the loss gradient. We demonstrate that our approach effectively filters adversarially perturbed images, mitigating the impact of FGSM attacks.
  The method is implemented in Python, and the source code is publicly available on GitHub for reproducibility and further research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16095">Good Representation, Better Explanation: Role of Convolutional Neural Networks in Transformer-Based Remote Sensing Image Captioning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Swadhin Das, Saarthak Gupta, and Kamal Kumar, Raksha Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) is the process of generating meaningful descriptions from remote sensing images. Recently, it has gained significant attention, with encoder-decoder models serving as the backbone for generating meaningful captions. The encoder extracts essential visual features from the input image, transforming them into a compact representation, while the decoder utilizes this representation to generate coherent textual descriptions. Recently, transformer-based models have gained significant popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information. The decoder has been well explored for text generation, whereas the encoder remains relatively unexplored. However, optimizing the encoder is crucial as it directly influences the richness of extracted features, which in turn affects the quality of generated captions. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate twelve different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures within a transformer-based encoder framework to assess their effectiveness in RSIC. The evaluation consists of two stages: first, a numerical analysis categorizes CNNs into different clusters, based on their performance. The best performing CNNs are then subjected to human evaluation from a human-centric perspective by a human annotator. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different search strategies, namely greedy search and beam search, to ensure the best caption. The results highlight the critical role of encoder selection in improving captioning performance, demonstrating that specific CNN architectures significantly enhance the quality of generated descriptions for remote sensing images. By providing a detailed comparison of multiple encoders, this study offers valuable insights to guide advances in transformer-based image captioning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tue M. Cao, Nhat X. Hoang, Hieu H. Pham, Phi Le Nguyen, My T. Thai</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of neural networks is essential for enhancing model performance and interpretability. Current research predominantly focuses on examining the connection between individual neurons and the model's final predictions. Which suffers from challenges in interpreting the internal workings of the model, particularly when neurons encode multiple unrelated features. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that transitions the focus from analyzing individual neurons to investigating groups of neurons, shifting the emphasis from neuron-output relationships to functional interaction between neurons. Our automated framework, NeurFlow, first identifies core neurons and clusters them into groups based on shared functional relationships, enabling a more coherent and interpretable view of the network's internal processes. This approach facilitates the construction of a hierarchical circuit representing neuron interactions across layers, thus improving interpretability while reducing computational costs. Our extensive empirical studies validate the fidelity of our proposed NeurFlow. Additionally, we showcase its utility in practical applications such as image debugging and automatic concept labeling, thereby highlighting its potential to advance the field of neural network explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nilesh Kumar Sahu, Snehil Gupta, Haroon R Lone</p>
<p>Abstract: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a widespread mental health condition, yet its lack of objective markers hinders timely detection and intervention. While previous research has focused on behavioral and non-verbal markers of SAD in structured activities (e.g., speeches or interviews), these settings fail to replicate real-world, unstructured social interactions fully. Identifying non-verbal markers in naturalistic, unstaged environments is essential for developing ubiquitous and non-intrusive monitoring solutions. To address this gap, we present AnxietyFaceTrack, a study leveraging facial video analysis to detect anxiety in unstaged social settings. A cohort of 91 participants engaged in a social setting with unfamiliar individuals and their facial videos were recorded using a low-cost smartphone camera. We examined facial features, including eye movements, head position, facial landmarks, and facial action units, and used self-reported survey data to establish ground truth for multiclass (anxious, neutral, non-anxious) and binary (e.g., anxious vs. neutral) classifications. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest classifier trained on the top 20% of features achieved the highest accuracy of 91.0% for multiclass classification and an average accuracy of 92.33% across binary classifications. Notably, head position and facial landmarks yielded the best performance for individual facial regions, achieving 85.0% and 88.0% accuracy, respectively, in multiclass classification, and 89.66% and 91.0% accuracy, respectively, across binary classifications. This study introduces a non-intrusive, cost-effective solution that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday smartphones for continuous anxiety monitoring, offering a promising pathway for early detection and intervention.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16129">Robust Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Liu, Hanyang Wang, Siyuan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) is a nascent field of research that involves the automated recognition of facial expressions in video data. Although existing research has primarily focused on learning representations under noisy and hard samples, the issue of the coexistence of both types of samples remains unresolved. In order to overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a robust method of distinguishing between hard and noisy samples. This is achieved by evaluating the prediction agreement of the model on different sampled clips of the video. Subsequently, methodologies that reinforce the learning of hard samples and mitigate the impact of noisy samples can be employed. Moreover, to identify the principal expression in a video and enhance the model's capacity for representation learning, comprising a key expression re-sampling framework and a dual-stream hierarchical network is proposed, namely Robust Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (RDFER). The key expression re-sampling framework is designed to identify the key expression, thereby mitigating the potential confusion caused by non-target expressions. RDFER employs two sequence models with the objective of disentangling short-term facial movements and long-term emotional changes. The proposed method has been shown to outperform current State-Of-The-Art approaches in DFER through extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets such as DFEW and FERV39K. A comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights and observations regarding the proposed agreement. This work has significant implications for the field of dynamic facial expression recognition and promotes the further development of the field of noise-consistent robust learning in dynamic facial expression recognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiamu Wang, Jin Tae Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: In computational pathology, researchers often face challenges due to the scarcity of labeled pathology datasets. Data augmentation emerges as a crucial technique to mitigate this limitation. In this study, we introduce an efficient data augmentation method for pathology images, called USegMix. Given a set of pathology images, the proposed method generates a new, synthetic image in two phases. In the first phase, USegMix constructs a pool of tissue segments in an automated and unsupervised manner using superpixels and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In the second phase, USegMix selects a candidate segment in a target image, replaces it with a similar segment from the segment pool, and blends them by using a pre-trained diffusion model. In this way, USegMix can generate diverse and realistic pathology images. We rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of USegMix on two pathology image datasets of colorectal and prostate cancers. The results demonstrate improvements in cancer classification performance, underscoring the substantial potential of USegMix for pathology image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenwen Yu, Zhibo Yang, Jianqiang Wan, Sibo Song, Jun Tang, Wenqing Cheng, Yuliang Liu, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Visually-situated text parsing (VsTP) has recently seen notable advancements, driven by the growing demand for automated document understanding and the emergence of large language models capable of processing document-based questions. While various methods have been proposed to tackle the complexities of VsTP, existing solutions often rely on task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks. This leads to modal isolation and complex workflows due to the diversified targets and heterogeneous schemas. In this paper, we introduce OmniParser V2, a universal model that unifies VsTP typical tasks, including text spotting, key information extraction, table recognition, and layout analysis, into a unified framework. Central to our approach is the proposed Structured-Points-of-Thought (SPOT) prompting schemas, which improves model performance across diverse scenarios by leveraging a unified encoder-decoder architecture, objective, and input\&output representation. SPOT eliminates the need for task-specific architectures and loss functions, significantly simplifying the processing pipeline. Our extensive evaluations across four tasks on eight different datasets show that OmniParser V2 achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results in VsTP. Additionally, we explore the integration of SPOT within a multimodal large language model structure, further enhancing text localization and recognition capabilities, thereby confirming the generality of SPOT prompting technique.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingkun Li, Ziming Wang, Guang Huo, Wei Chen, Xiaoning Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the expanding application scope of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the demand for stable UAV control has significantly increased. However, in complex environments, GPS signals are prone to interference, resulting in ineffective UAV positioning. Therefore, self-positioning of UAVs in GPS-denied environments has become a critical objective. Some methods obtain geolocation information in GPS-denied environments by matching ground objects in the UAV viewpoint with remote sensing images. However, most of these methods only provide coarse-level positioning, which satisfies cross-view geo-localization but cannot support precise UAV positioning tasks. Consequently, this paper focuses on a newer and more challenging task: precise UAV self-positioning based on remote sensing images. This approach not only considers the features of ground objects but also accounts for the spatial distribution of objects in the images. To address this challenge, we present a deep learning framework with geographic information adaptive loss, which achieves precise localization by aligning UAV images with corresponding satellite imagery in fine detail through the integration of geographic information from multiple perspectives. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a series of experiments. The results demonstrate the method's efficacy in enabling UAVs to achieve precise self-positioning using remote sensing imagery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinwei Liu, Xiaojun Jia, Yuan Xun, Hua Zhang, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized data generation, particularly in text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, the widespread use of personalized generative models raises significant concerns regarding privacy violations and copyright infringement. To address these issues, researchers have proposed adversarial perturbation-based protection techniques. However, these methods have notable limitations, including insufficient robustness against data transformations and the inability to fully eliminate identifiable features of protected objects in the generated output. In this paper, we introduce PersGuard, a novel backdoor-based approach that prevents malicious personalization of specific images. Unlike traditional adversarial perturbation methods, PersGuard implant backdoor triggers into pre-trained T2I models, preventing the generation of customized outputs for designated protected images while allowing normal personalization for unprotected ones. Unfortunately, existing backdoor methods for T2I diffusion models fail to be applied to personalization scenarios due to the different backdoor objectives and the potential backdoor elimination during downstream fine-tuning processes. To address these, we propose three novel backdoor objectives specifically designed for personalization scenarios, coupled with backdoor retention loss engineered to resist downstream fine-tuning. These components are integrated into a unified optimization framework. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate PersGuard's effectiveness in preserving data privacy, even under challenging conditions including gray-box settings, multi-object protection, and facial identity scenarios. Our method significantly outperforms existing techniques, offering a more robust solution for privacy and copyright protection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human bodily movements convey critical insights into action intentions and cognitive processes, yet existing multimodal systems primarily focused on understanding human motion via language, vision, and audio, which struggle to capture the dynamic forces and torques inherent in 3D motion. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) present a promising alternative, offering lightweight, wearable, and privacy-conscious motion sensing. However, processing of streaming IMU data faces challenges such as wireless transmission instability, sensor noise, and drift, limiting their utility for long-term real-time motion capture (MoCap), and more importantly, online motion analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce Mojito, an intelligent motion agent that integrates inertial sensing with large language models (LLMs) for interactive motion capture and behavioral analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunyu Zhao, Wentao Mu, Xian Zhou, Wenbo Liu, Fei Yan, Tao Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Driver attention recognition in driving scenarios is a popular direction in traffic scene perception technology. It aims to understand human driver attention to focus on specific targets/objects in the driving scene. However, traffic scenes contain not only a large amount of visual information but also semantic information related to driving tasks. Existing methods lack attention to the actual semantic information present in driving scenes. Additionally, the traffic scene is a complex and dynamic process that requires constant attention to objects related to the current driving task. Existing models, influenced by their foundational frameworks, tend to have large parameter counts and complex structures. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time saliency Mamba network based on the latest Mamba framework. As shown in Figure 1, our model uses very few parameters (0.08M, only 0.09~11.16% of other models), while maintaining SOTA performance or achieving over 98% of the SOTA model's performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuguang Yang, Tongfei Chen, Haoyu Huang, Linlin Yang, Chunyu Xie, Dawei Leng, Xianbin Cao, Baochang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot medical detection can further improve detection performance without relying on annotated medical images even upon the fine-tuned model, showing great clinical value. Recent studies leverage grounded vision-language models (GLIP) to achieve this by using detailed disease descriptions as prompts for the target disease name during the inference phase. However, these methods typically treat prompts as equivalent context to the target name, making it difficult to assign specific disease knowledge based on visual information, leading to a coarse alignment between images and target descriptions. In this paper, we propose StructuralGLIP, which introduces an auxiliary branch to encode prompts into a latent knowledge bank layer-by-layer, enabling more context-aware and fine-grained alignment. Specifically, in each layer, we select highly similar features from both the image representation and the knowledge bank, forming structural representations that capture nuanced relationships between image patches and target descriptions. These features are then fused across modalities to further enhance detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StructuralGLIP achieves a +4.1\% AP improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods across seven zero-shot medical detection benchmarks, and consistently improves fine-tuned models by +3.2\% AP on endoscopy image datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional deepfake detectors have dealt with the detection problem as a binary classification task. This approach can achieve satisfactory results in cases where samples of a given deepfake generation technique have been seen during training, but can easily fail with deepfakes generated by other techniques. In this paper, we propose DiffFake, a novel deepfake detector that approaches the detection problem as an anomaly detection task. Specifically, DiffFake learns natural changes that occur between two facial images of the same person by leveraging a differential anomaly detection framework. This is done by combining pairs of deep face embeddings and using them to train an anomaly detection model. We further propose to train a feature extractor on pseudo-deepfakes with global and local artifacts, to extract meaningful and generalizable features that can then be used to train the anomaly detection model. We perform extensive experiments on five different deepfake datasets and show that our method can match and sometimes even exceed the performance of state-of-the-art competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan-Anh Yang, Truong-Son Hy, Phuong D. Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multiscale object-based graph neural network called MOB-GCN for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The central aim of this study is to enhance feature extraction and classification performance by utilizing multiscale object-based image analysis (OBIA). Traditional pixel-based methods often suffer from low accuracy and speckle noise, while single-scale OBIA approaches may overlook crucial information of image objects at different levels of detail. MOB-GCN overcomes these challenges by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales, leveraging the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture to capture both fine-grained and global spatial patterns. MOB-GCN addresses this issue by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales to improve classification results using the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture that can model fine-grained and global spatial patterns. By constructing a dynamic multiscale graph hierarchy, MOB-GCN offers a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate details and global context of HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that MOB-GCN consistently outperforms single-scale graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and noise reduction, particularly when labeled data is limited. The implementation of MOB-GCN is publicly available at https://github.com/HySonLab/MultiscaleHSI</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Xiong, Yue Shi, Yishun Dou, Bingbing Ni</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, denoising diffusion models have achieved promising results in 2D image generation and editing. Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (IN2N) introduces the success of diffusion into 3D scene editing through an "Iterative dataset update" (IDU) strategy. Though achieving fascinating results, IN2N suffers from problems of blurry backgrounds and trapping in local optima. The first problem is caused by IN2N's lack of efficient guidance for background maintenance, while the second stems from the interaction between image editing and NeRF training during IDU. In this work, we introduce DualNeRF to deal with these problems. We propose a dual-field representation to preserve features of the original scene and utilize them as additional guidance to the model for background maintenance during IDU. Moreover, a simulated annealing strategy is embedded into IDU to endow our model with the power of addressing local optima issues. A CLIP-based consistency indicator is used to further improve the editing quality by filtering out low-quality edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Hu, Wenhao Chai, Shengyu Hao, Xiaotong Cui, Xuexiang Wen, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Gaoang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving a consistent and compact 3D segmentation field is crucial for maintaining semantic coherence across views and accurately representing scene structures. Previous 3D scene segmentation methods rely on video segmentation models to address inconsistencies across views, but the absence of spatial information often leads to object misassociation when object temporarily disappear and reappear. Furthermore, in the process of 3D scene reconstruction, segmentation and optimization are often treated as separate tasks. As a result, optimization typically lacks awareness of semantic category information, which can result in floaters with ambiguous segmentation. To address these challenges, we introduce CCGS, a method designed to achieve both view consistent 2D segmentation and a compact 3D Gaussian segmentation field. CCGS incorporates pointmap association and a piecewise-plane constraint. First, we establish pixel correspondence between adjacent images by minimizing the Euclidean distance between their pointmaps. We then redefine object mask overlap accordingly. The Hungarian algorithm is employed to optimize mask association by minimizing the total matching cost, while allowing for partial matches. To further enhance compactness, the piecewise-plane constraint restricts point displacement within local planes during optimization, thereby preserving structural integrity. Experimental results on ScanNet and Replica datasets demonstrate that CCGS outperforms existing methods in both 2D panoptic segmentation and 3D Gaussian segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural radiance field (NeRF) research has made significant progress in modeling static video content captured in the wild. However, current models and rendering processes rarely consider scenes captured underwater, which are useful for studying and filming ocean life. They fail to address visual artifacts unique to underwater scenes, such as moving fish and suspended particles. This paper introduces a novel NeRF renderer and optimization scheme for an implicit MLP-based NeRF model. Our renderer reduces the influence of floaters and moving objects that interfere with static objects of interest by estimating a single surface per ray. We use a Gaussian weight function with a small offset to ensure that the transmittance of the surrounding media remains constant. Additionally, we enhance our model with a depth-based scaling function to upscale gradients for near-camera volumes. Overall, our method outperforms the baseline Nerfacto by approximately 7.5\% and SeaThru-NeRF by 6.2% in terms of PSNR. Subjective evaluation also shows a significant reduction of artifacts while preserving details of static targets and background compared to the state of the arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyungbok Lee, You Zhang, Zhiyao Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) is to localize and segment the sounding source objects from the video frames. Researchers working on AVS suffer from limited datasets because hand-crafted annotation is expensive. Recent works attempt to overcome the challenge of limited data by leveraging the segmentation foundation model, SAM, prompting it with audio to enhance its ability to segment sounding source objects. While this approach alleviates the model's burden on understanding visual modality by utilizing pre-trained knowledge of SAM, it does not address the fundamental challenge of the limited dataset for learning audio-visual relationships. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AV2T-SAM}, a novel framework that bridges audio features with the text embedding space of pre-trained text-prompted SAM. Our method leverages multimodal correspondence learned from rich text-image paired datasets to enhance audio-visual alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a novel feature, $\mathbf{\textit{\textbf{f}}_{CLIP} \odot \textit{\textbf{f}}_{CLAP}}$, which emphasizes shared semantics of audio and visual modalities while filtering irrelevant noise. Experiments on the AVSBench dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both datasets of AVSBench. Our approach outperforms existing methods by effectively utilizing pretrained segmentation models and cross-modal semantic alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheling Meng, Bo Peng, Xiaochuan Jin, Yueming Lyu, Wei Wang, Jing Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated the underlying risk of generating various unwanted content, such as sexual elements. To address this issue, the task of concept erasure has been introduced, aiming to erase any undesired concepts that the models can generate. Previous methods, whether training-based or training-free, have primarily focused on the input side, i.e. texts. However, they often suffer from incomplete erasure due to limitations in the generalization from limited prompts to diverse image content. In this paper, motivated by the notion that concept erasure on the output side, i.e. generated images, may be more direct and effective, we propose to check concepts based on intermediate-generated images and correct them in the remainder of the generation process. Two key challenges are identified, i.e. determining the presence of target concepts during generation and replacing them on the fly. Leveraging the generation mechanism of diffusion models, we present the Concept Corrector, which incorporates the Generation Check Mechanism and the Concept Removal Attention. This method can identify the generated features associated with target concepts and replace them using pre-defined negative prompts, thereby achieving concept erasure. It requires no changes to model parameters and only relies on a given concept name and its replacement content. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first erasure method based on intermediate-generated images. The experiments on various concepts demonstrate its impressive erasure performance.

<p>Abstract: As automated vehicles enter public roads, safety in a near-infinite number of driving scenarios becomes one of the major concerns for the widespread adoption of fully autonomous driving. The ability to detect anomalous situations outside of the operational design domain is a key component in self-driving cars, enabling us to mitigate the impact of abnormal ego behaviors and to realize trustworthy driving systems. On-road anomaly detection in egocentric videos remains a challenging problem due to the difficulties introduced by complex and interactive scenarios. We conduct a holistic analysis of common on-road anomaly patterns, from which we propose three unsupervised anomaly detection experts: a scene expert that focuses on frame-level appearances to detect abnormal scenes and unexpected scene motions; an interaction expert that models normal relative motions between two road participants and raises alarms whenever anomalous interactions emerge; and a behavior expert which monitors abnormal behaviors of individual objects by future trajectory prediction. To combine the strengths of all the modules, we propose an expert ensemble (Xen) using a Kalman filter, in which the final anomaly score is absorbed as one of the states and the observations are generated by the experts. Our experiments employ a novel evaluation protocol for realistic model performance, demonstrate superior anomaly detection performance than previous methods, and show that our framework has potential in classifying anomaly types using unsupervised learning on a large-scale on-road anomaly dataset.</p>

We introduce the first industrial anomaly synthesis (IAS) taxonomy. Prior works lack formal classification or use simplistic taxonomies, hampering structured comparisons and trend identification. Our taxonomy provides a fine-grained framework reflecting methodological progress and practical implications, grounding future research. Furthermore, we explore cross-modality synthesis and large-scale VLM. Previous surveys overlooked multimodal data and VLM in anomaly synthesis, limiting insights into their advantages. Our survey analyzes their integration, benefits, challenges, and prospects, offering a roadmap to boost IAS with multimodal learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianbin Jiao, Xina Cheng, Kailun Yang, Xiangrong Zhang, Licheng Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D human pose estimation has wide applications in fields such as intelligent surveillance, motion capture, and virtual reality. However, in real-world scenarios, issues such as occlusion, noise interference, and missing viewpoints can severely affect pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce the task of Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation. Traditional 3D pose estimation methods often rely on multi-stage networks and modular combinations, which can lead to cumulative errors and increased training complexity, making them unable to effectively address deficiency-aware estimation. To this end, we propose DeProPose, a flexible method that simplifies the network architecture to reduce training complexity and avoid information loss in multi-stage designs. Additionally, the model innovatively introduces a multi-view feature fusion mechanism based on relative projection error, which effectively utilizes information from multiple viewpoints and dynamically assigns weights, enabling efficient integration and enhanced robustness to overcome deficiency-aware 3D Pose Estimation challenges. Furthermore, to thoroughly evaluate this end-to-end multi-view 3D human pose estimation model and to advance research on occlusion-related challenges, we have developed a novel 3D human pose estimation dataset, termed the Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation (DA-3DPE) dataset. This dataset encompasses a wide range of deficiency scenarios, including noise interference, missing viewpoints, and occlusion challenges. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DeProPose not only excels in addressing the deficiency-aware problem but also shows improvement in conventional scenarios, providing a powerful and user-friendly solution for 3D human pose estimation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaibin Zhou, Shengjie Zhao, Hao Deng, Lin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, there are few effective methods for synthesizing a mass of high-resolution rainy images in complex illumination conditions. However, these methods are essential for synthesizing large-scale high-quality paired rainy-clean image datasets, which can train deep learning-based single image rain removal models capable of generalizing to various illumination conditions. Therefore, we propose a practical two-stage learning-from-rendering pipeline for high-resolution rainy image synthesis. The pipeline combines the benefits of the realism of rendering-based methods and the high-efficiency of learning-based methods, providing the possibility of creating large-scale high-quality paired rainy-clean image datasets. In the rendering stage, we use a rendering-based method to create a High-resolution Rainy Image (HRI) dataset, which contains realistic high-resolution paired rainy-clean images of multiple scenes and various illumination conditions. In the learning stage, to learn illumination information from background images for high-resolution rainy image generation, we propose a High-resolution Rainy Image Generation Network (HRIGNet). HRIGNet is designed to introduce a guiding diffusion model in the Latent Diffusion Model, which provides additional guidance information for high-resolution image synthesis. In our experiments, HRIGNet is able to synthesize high-resolution rainy images up to 2048x1024 resolution. Rain removal experiments on real dataset validate that our method can help improve the robustness of deep derainers to real rainy images. To make our work reproducible, source codes and the dataset have been released at https://kb824999404.github.io/HRIG/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duo Peng, Qiuhong Ke, Mark He Huang, Ping Hu, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced significantly, but their growing popularity raises security concerns due to their potential to generate harmful images. To address these issues, we propose UPAM, a novel framework to evaluate the robustness of T2I models from an attack perspective. Unlike prior methods that focus solely on textual defenses, UPAM unifies the attack on both textual and visual defenses. Additionally, it enables gradient-based optimization, overcoming reliance on enumeration for improved efficiency and effectiveness. To handle cases where T2I models block image outputs due to defenses, we introduce Sphere-Probing Learning (SPL) to enable optimization even without image results. Following SPL, our model bypasses defenses, inducing the generation of harmful content. To ensure semantic alignment with attacker intent, we propose Semantic-Enhancing Learning (SEL) for precise semantic control. UPAM also prioritizes the naturalness of adversarial prompts using In-context Naturalness Enhancement (INE), making them harder for human examiners to detect. Additionally, we address the issue of iterative queries--common in prior methods and easily detectable by API defenders--by introducing Transferable Attack Learning (TAL), allowing effective attacks with minimal queries. Extensive experiments validate UPAM's superiority in effectiveness, efficiency, naturalness, and low query detection rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyeok Chu, Seonguk Seo, Bohyung Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs) have significantly improved image captioning, but extending these gains to video understanding remains challenging due to the scarcity of fine-grained video captioning datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel zero-shot video captioning approach that combines frame-level scene graphs from a video to obtain intermediate representations for caption generation. Our method first generates frame-level captions using an image VLM, converts them into scene graphs, and consolidates these graphs to produce comprehensive video-level descriptions. To achieve this, we leverage a lightweight graph-to-text model trained solely on text corpora, eliminating the need for video captioning annotations. Experiments on the MSR-VTT and ActivityNet Captions datasets show that our approach outperforms zero-shot video captioning baselines, demonstrating that aggregating frame-level scene graphs yields rich video understanding without requiring large-scale paired data or high inference cost.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16428">Visual Reasoning Evaluation of Grok, Deepseek Janus, Gemini, Qwen, Mistral, and ChatGPT</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nidhal Jegham, Marwan Abdelatti, Abdeltawab Hendawi</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional evaluations of multimodal large language models (LLMs) have been limited by their focus on single-image reasoning, failing to assess crucial aspects like contextual understanding, reasoning stability, and uncertainty calibration. This study addresses these limitations by introducing a novel benchmark that integrates multi-image reasoning tasks with rejection-based evaluation and positional bias detection. To evaluate these dimensions, we further introduce entropy as a novel metric for quantifying reasoning consistency across reordered answer variants. We applied this benchmark to assess Grok 3, ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-o1, Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, DeepSeek Janus models, Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, QVQ-72B-Preview, and Pixtral 12B across eight visual reasoning tasks, including difference spotting and diagram interpretation. Our findings reveal ChatGPT-o1 leading in overall accuracy (82.5\%) and rejection accuracy (70.0\%), closely followed by Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental (70.8\%). QVQ-72B-Preview demonstrated superior rejection accuracy (85.5\%). Notably, Pixtral 12B (51.7\%) showed promise in specific domains, while Janus models exhibited challenges in bias and uncertainty calibration, reflected in low rejection accuracies and high entropy scores. High entropy scores in Janus models (Janus 7B: 0.8392, Janus 1B: 0.787) underscore their susceptibility to positional bias and unstable reasoning, contrasting with the low entropy and robust reasoning of ChatGPT models. The study further demonstrates that model size is not the sole determinant of performance, as evidenced by Grok 3 underperformance despite its substantial parameter count. By employing multi-image contexts, rejection mechanisms, and entropy-based consistency metrics, this benchmark sets a new standard for evaluating multimodal LLMs, enabling a more robust and reliable assessment of next-generation AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in multimodal understanding; however, their fundamental visual cognitive abilities remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisFactor, a novel benchmark derived from the Factor-Referenced Cognitive Test (FRCT), a well-established psychometric assessment of human cognition. VisFactor digitalizes vision-related FRCT subtests to systematically evaluate MLLMs across essential visual cognitive tasks including spatial reasoning, perceptual speed, and pattern recognition. We present a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Qwen-VL, using VisFactor under diverse prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought and Multi-Agent Debate. Our findings reveal a concerning deficiency in current MLLMs' fundamental visual cognition, with performance frequently approaching random guessing and showing only marginal improvements even with advanced prompting techniques. These results underscore the critical need for focused research to enhance the core visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. To foster further investigation in this area, we release our VisFactor benchmark at https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/VisFactor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Shangguan, Daniel Seita, Mohammad Rostami</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in cross-modal feature extraction and integration have significantly enhanced performance in few-shot learning tasks. However, current multi-modal object detection (MM-OD) methods often experience notable performance degradation when encountering substantial domain shifts. We propose that incorporating rich textual information can enable the model to establish a more robust knowledge relationship between visual instances and their corresponding language descriptions, thereby mitigating the challenges of domain shift. Specifically, we focus on the problem of Cross-Domain Multi-Modal Few-Shot Object Detection (CDMM-FSOD) and introduce a meta-learning-based framework designed to leverage rich textual semantics as an auxiliary modality to achieve effective domain adaptation. Our new architecture incorporates two key components: (i) A multi-modal feature aggregation module, which aligns visual and linguistic feature embeddings to ensure cohesive integration across modalities. (ii) A rich text semantic rectification module, which employs bidirectional text feature generation to refine multi-modal feature alignment, thereby enhancing understanding of language and its application in object detection. We evaluate the proposed method on common cross-domain object detection benchmarks and demonstrate that it significantly surpasses existing few-shot object detection approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinbo Yan, Alan Zhao, Yixin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-image 3D generation has emerged as a prominent research topic, playing a vital role in virtual reality, 3D modeling, and digital content creation. However, existing methods face challenges such as a lack of multi-view geometric consistency and limited controllability during the generation process, which significantly restrict their usability. % To tackle these challenges, we introduce Dragen3D, a novel approach that achieves geometrically consistent and controllable 3D generation leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We introduce the Anchor-Gaussian Variational Autoencoder (Anchor-GS VAE), which encodes a point cloud and a single image into anchor latents and decode these latents into 3DGS, enabling efficient latent-space generation. To enable multi-view geometry consistent and controllable generation, we propose a Seed-Point-Driven strategy: first generate sparse seed points as a coarse geometry representation, then map them to anchor latents via the Seed-Anchor Mapping Module. Geometric consistency is ensured by the easily learned sparse seed points, and users can intuitively drag the seed points to deform the final 3DGS geometry, with changes propagated through the anchor latents. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve geometrically controllable 3D Gaussian generation and editing without relying on 2D diffusion priors, delivering comparable 3D generation quality to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caixiong Li, Xiongwei Zhao, Jinhang Zhang, Xing Zhang, Zhou Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary detection (OVD) is a challenging task to detect and classify objects from an unrestricted set of categories, including those unseen during training. Existing open-vocabulary detectors are limited by complex visual-textual misalignment and long-tailed category imbalances, leading to suboptimal performance in challenging scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MQADet}, a universal paradigm for enhancing existing open-vocabulary detectors by leveraging the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MQADet functions as a plug-and-play solution that integrates seamlessly with pre-trained object detectors without substantial additional training costs. Specifically, we design a novel three-stage Multimodal Question Answering (MQA) pipeline to guide the MLLMs to precisely localize complex textual and visual targets while effectively enhancing the focus of existing object detectors on relevant objects. To validate our approach, we present a new benchmark for evaluating our paradigm on four challenging open-vocabulary datasets, employing three state-of-the-art object detectors as baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed paradigm significantly improves the performance of existing detectors, particularly in unseen complex categories, across diverse and challenging scenarios. To facilitate future research, we will publicly release our code.</p>

<p>Abstract: Point cloud salient object detection has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years. Since existing works do not fully utilize the geometry context of 3D objects, blurry boundaries are generated when segmenting objects with complex backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware 3D salient object detection network that explicitly clusters points into superpoints to enhance the geometric boundaries of objects, thereby segmenting complete objects with clear boundaries. Specifically, we first propose a simple yet effective superpoint partition module to cluster points into superpoints. In order to improve the quality of superpoints, we present a point cloud class-agnostic loss to learn discriminative point features for clustering superpoints from the object. After obtaining superpoints, we then propose a geometry enhancement module that utilizes superpoint-point attention to aggregate geometric information into point features for predicting the salient map of the object with clear boundaries. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the PCSOD dataset.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16493">Trunk-branch Contrastive Network with Multi-view Deformable Aggregation for Multi-view Action Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingyuan Yang, Guoyuan Liang, Can Wang, Xiaojun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to identify actions in a given multi-view scene. Traditional studies initially extracted refined features from each view, followed by implemented paired interaction and integration, but they potentially overlooked the critical local features in each view. When observing objects from multiple perspectives, individuals typically form a comprehensive impression and subsequently fill in specific details. Drawing inspiration from this cognitive process, we propose a novel trunk-branch contrastive network (TBCNet) for RGB-based multi-view action recognition. Distinctively, TBCNet first obtains fused features in the trunk block and then implicitly supplements vital details provided by the branch block via contrastive learning, generating a more informative and comprehensive action representation. Within this framework, we construct two core components: the multi-view deformable aggregation and the trunk-branch contrastive learning. MVDA employed in the trunk block effectively facilitates multi-view feature fusion and adaptive cross-view spatio-temporal correlation, where a global aggregation module is utilized to emphasize significant spatial information and a composite relative position bias is designed to capture the intra- and cross-view relative positions. Moreover, a trunk-branch contrastive loss is constructed between aggregated features and refined details from each view. By incorporating two distinct weights for positive and negative samples, a weighted trunk-branch contrastive loss is proposed to extract valuable information and emphasize subtle inter-class differences. The effectiveness of TBCNet is verified by extensive experiments on four datasets including NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD, and N-UCLA dataset. Compared to other RGB-based methods, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-subject and cross-setting protocols.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingyuan Yang, Guoyuan Liang, Xianwen Wang, Kaiming Wang, Can Wang, Xiaojun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: To satisfy the rigorous requirements of precise edge detection in critical high-accuracy measurements, this article proposes a series of efficient approaches for localizing subpixel edge. In contrast to the fitting based methods, which consider pixel intensity as a sample value derived from a specific model. We take an innovative perspective by assuming that the intensity at the pixel level can be interpreted as a local integral mapping in the intensity model for subpixel localization. Consequently, we propose a straightforward subpixel edge localization method called Converted Intensity Summation (CIS). To address the limited robustness associated with focusing solely on the localization of individual edge points, a Stable Edge Region (SER) based algorithm is presented to alleviate local interference near edges. Given the observation that the consistency of edge statistics exists in the local region, the algorithm seeks correlated stable regions in the vicinity of edges to facilitate the acquisition of robust parameters and achieve higher precision positioning. In addition, an edge complement method based on extension-adjustment is also introduced to rectify the irregular edges through the efficient migration of SERs. A large number of experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real image datasets which cover common edge patterns as well as various real scenarios such as industrial PCB images, remote sensing and medical images. It is verified that CIS can achieve higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art method, while requiring less execution time. Moreover, by integrating SER into CIS, the proposed algorithm demonstrates excellent performance in further improving the anti-interference capability and positioning accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanh Trung Vu, Andreas Kofler, Kostas Papafitsoros</p>
<p>Abstract: We extend a recently introduced deep unrolling framework for learning spatially varying regularisation parameters in inverse imaging problems to the case of Total Generalised Variation (TGV). The framework combines a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) inferring the two spatially varying TGV parameters with an unrolled algorithmic scheme that solves the corresponding variational problem. The two subnetworks are jointly trained end-to-end in a supervised fashion and as such the CNN learns to compute those parameters that drive the reconstructed images as close to the ground truth as possible. Numerical results in image denoising and MRI reconstruction show a significant qualitative and quantitative improvement compared to the best TGV scalar parameter case as well as to other approaches employing spatially varying parameters computed by unsupervised methods. We also observe that the inferred spatially varying parameter maps have a consistent structure near the image edges, asking for further theoretical investigations. In particular, the parameter that weighs the first-order TGV term has a triple-edge structure with alternating high-low-high values whereas the one that weighs the second-order term attains small values in a large neighbourhood around the edges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that the visual place recognition (VPR) method using pre-trained visual foundation models can achieve promising performance. In our previous work, we propose a novel method to realize seamless adaptation of foundation models to VPR (SelaVPR). This method can produce both global and local features that focus on discriminative landmarks to recognize places for two-stage VPR by a parameter-efficient adaptation approach. Although SelaVPR has achieved competitive results, we argue that the previous adaptation is inefficient in training time and GPU memory usage, and the re-ranking paradigm is also costly in retrieval latency and storage usage. In pursuit of higher efficiency and better performance, we propose an extension of the SelaVPR, called SelaVPR++. Concretely, we first design a parameter-, time-, and memory-efficient adaptation method that uses lightweight multi-scale convolution (MultiConv) adapters to refine intermediate features from the frozen foundation backbone. This adaptation method does not back-propagate gradients through the backbone during training, and the MultiConv adapter facilitates feature interactions along the spatial axes and introduces proper local priors, thus achieving higher efficiency and better performance. Moreover, we propose an innovative re-ranking paradigm for more efficient VPR. Instead of relying on local features for re-ranking, which incurs huge overhead in latency and storage, we employ compact binary features for initial retrieval and robust floating-point (global) features for re-ranking. To obtain such binary features, we propose a similarity-constrained deep hashing method, which can be easily integrated into the VPR pipeline. Finally, we improve our training strategy and unify the training protocol of several common training datasets to merge them for better training of VPR models. Extensive experiments show that ......</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Yang, Yangyang Guo, Hui Lu, Yan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides across diverse multimodal tasks and benchmarks. This paper reveals a largely under-explored problem from existing video-involved LVLMs - language bias, where models tend to prioritize language over video and thus result in incorrect responses. To address this research gap, we first collect a Video Language Bias Evaluation Benchmark, which is specifically designed to assess the language bias in video-involved LVLMs through two key tasks: ambiguous video contrast and interrogative question probing. Accordingly, we design accompanied evaluation metrics that aim to penalize LVLMs being biased by language. In addition, we also propose Multi-branch Contrastive Decoding (MCD), introducing two expert branches to simultaneously counteract language bias potentially generated by the amateur text-only branch. Our experiments demonstrate that i) existing video-involved LVLMs, including both proprietary and open-sourced, are largely limited by the language bias problem; ii) our MCD can effectively mitigate this issue and maintain general-purpose capabilities in various video-involved LVLMs without any additional retraining or alteration to model architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Caetano, Christiaan Viviers, Lena Filatova, Peter H. N. de With, Fons van der Sommen</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the quality and integrity of medical images is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy in deep learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis and Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems. Covariate shifts are subtle variations in the data distribution caused by different imaging devices or settings and can severely degrade model performance, similar to the effects of adversarial attacks. Therefore, it is vital to have a lightweight and fast method to assess the quality of these images prior to using CAD models. AdverX-Ray addresses this need by serving as an image-quality assessment layer, designed to detect covariate shifts effectively. This Adversarial Variational Autoencoder prioritizes the discriminator's role, using the suboptimal outputs of the generator as negative samples to fine-tune the discriminator's ability to identify high-frequency artifacts. Images generated by adversarial networks often exhibit severe high-frequency artifacts, guiding the discriminator to focus excessively on these components. This makes the discriminator ideal for this approach. Trained on patches from X-ray images of specific machine models, AdverX-Ray can evaluate whether a scan matches the training distribution, or if a scan from the same machine is captured under different settings. Extensive comparisons with various OOD detection methods show that AdverX-Ray significantly outperforms existing techniques, achieving a 96.2% average AUROC using only 64 random patches from an X-ray. Its lightweight and fast architecture makes it suitable for real-time applications, enhancing the reliability of medical imaging systems. The code and pretrained models are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qipan Xu, Zhenting Wang, Xiaoxiao He, Ligong Han, Ruixiang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI models, renowned for their ability to synthesize high-quality content, have sparked growing concerns over the improper generation of copyright-protected material. While recent studies have proposed various approaches to address copyright issues, the capability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to detect copyright infringements remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on evaluating the copyright detection abilities of state-of-the-art LVLMs using a various set of image samples. Recognizing the absence of a comprehensive dataset that includes both IP-infringement samples and ambiguous non-infringement negative samples, we construct a benchmark dataset comprising positive samples that violate the copyright protection of well-known IP figures, as well as negative samples that resemble these figures but do not raise copyright concerns. This dataset is created using advanced prompt engineering techniques. We then evaluate leading LVLMs using our benchmark dataset. Our experimental results reveal that LVLMs are prone to overfitting, leading to the misclassification of some negative samples as IP-infringement cases. In the final section, we analyze these failure cases and propose potential solutions to mitigate the overfitting problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinwei Long, Zhiyuan Ma, Ermo Hua, Kaiyan Zhang, Biqing Qi, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged to address the knowledge-intensive visual question answering (VQA) task. Current methods mainly employ separate retrieval and generation modules to acquire external knowledge and generate answers, respectively. We propose ReAuSE, an alternative to the previous RAG model for the knowledge-based VQA task, which seamlessly integrates knowledge retriever into the generative multi-modal large language model, serving as a built-in search engine. Specifically, our model functions both as a generative retriever and an accurate answer generator. It not only helps retrieve documents from the knowledge base by producing identifiers for each document, but it also answers visual questions based on the retrieved documents. Furthermore, we propose a reinforced retrieval calibration module from relevance feedback to improve retrieval performance and align with the preferences for accurate answer generation. Extensive experiments on two representative OKVQA and A-OKVQA datasets demonstrate significant improvements ranging from 2.9\% to 9.6\% across all evaluation metrics when compared to strong baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Dr. Splat, a novel approach for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting. Unlike existing language-embedded 3DGS methods, which rely on a rendering process, our method directly associates language-aligned CLIP embeddings with 3D Gaussians for holistic 3D scene understanding. The key of our method is a language feature registration technique where CLIP embeddings are assigned to the dominant Gaussians intersected by each pixel-ray. Moreover, we integrate Product Quantization (PQ) trained on general large-scale image data to compactly represent embeddings without per-scene optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches in 3D perception benchmarks, such as open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, 3D object localization, and 3D object selection tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xikai Tang, Ye Huang, Guangqiang Yin, Lixin Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present VPNeXt, a new and simple model for the Plain Vision Transformer (ViT). Unlike the many related studies that share the same homogeneous paradigms, VPNeXt offers a fresh perspective on dense representation based on ViT. In more detail, the proposed VPNeXt addressed two concerns about the existing paradigm: (1) Is it necessary to use a complex Transformer Mask Decoder architecture to obtain good representations? (2) Does the Plain ViT really need to depend on the mock pyramid feature for upsampling? For (1), we investigated the potential underlying reasons that contributed to the effectiveness of the Transformer Decoder and introduced the Visual Context Replay (VCR) to achieve similar effects efficiently. For (2), we introduced the ViTUp module. This module fully utilizes the previously overlooked ViT real pyramid feature to achieve better upsampling results compared to the earlier mock pyramid feature. This represents the first instance of such functionality in the field of semantic segmentation for Plain ViT. We performed ablation studies on related modules to verify their effectiveness gradually. We conducted relevant comparative experiments and visualizations to show that VPNeXt achieved state-of-the-art performance with a simple and effective design. Moreover, the proposed VPNeXt significantly exceeded the long-established mIoU wall/barrier of the VOC2012 dataset, setting a new state-of-the-art by a large margin, which also stands as the largest improvement since 2015.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As a novel and challenging task, referring segmentation combines computer vision and natural language processing to localize and segment objects based on textual descriptions. While referring image segmentation (RIS) has been extensively studied in natural images, little attention has been given to aerial imagery, particularly from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The unique challenges of UAV imagery, including complex spatial scales, occlusions, and varying object orientations, render existing RIS approaches ineffective. A key limitation has been the lack of UAV-specific datasets, as manually annotating pixel-level masks and generating textual descriptions is labour-intensive and time-consuming. To address this gap, we design an automatic labelling pipeline that leverages pre-existing UAV segmentation datasets and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for generating textual descriptions. Furthermore, we propose Aerial Referring Transformer (AeroReformer), a novel framework for UAV referring image segmentation (UAV-RIS), featuring a Vision-Language Cross-Attention Module (VLCAM) for effective cross-modal understanding and a Rotation-Aware Multi-Scale Fusion (RAMSF) decoder to enhance segmentation accuracy in aerial scenes. Extensive experiments on two newly developed datasets demonstrate the superiority of AeroReformer over existing methods, establishing a new benchmark for UAV-RIS.

<p>Abstract: Interpretability is crucial to enhance trust in machine learning models for medical diagnostics. However, most state-of-the-art image classifiers based on neural networks are not interpretable. As a result, clinicians often resort to known biomarkers for diagnosis, although biomarker-based classification typically performs worse than large neural networks. This work proposes a method that surpasses the performance of established machine learning models while simultaneously improving prediction interpretability for diabetic retinopathy staging from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Our method is based on a novel biology-informed heterogeneous graph representation that models retinal vessel segments, intercapillary areas, and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in a human-interpretable way. This graph representation allows us to frame diabetic retinopathy staging as a graph-level classification task, which we solve using an efficient graph neural network. We benchmark our method against well-established baselines, including classical biomarker-based classifiers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformers. Our model outperforms all baselines on two datasets. Crucially, we use our biology-informed graph to provide explanations of unprecedented detail. Our approach surpasses existing methods in precisely localizing and identifying critical vessels or intercapillary areas. In addition, we give informative and human-interpretable attributions to critical characteristics. Our work contributes to the development of clinical decision-support tools in ophthalmology.</p>

<p>Abstract: We can achieve fast and consistent early skin cancer detection with recent developments in computer vision and deep learning techniques.

Our unified deep learning model efficiently delivers dual-function skin lesion classification and segmentation for clinical diagnosis. Evaluated on ISIC-2017 and PH2 datasets, our network demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models across multiple metrics through 5-fold cross-validation. Our findings illustrate significant advancements in the precision of segmentation and classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dewan Tauhid Rahman, Yeahia Sarker, Antar Mazumder, Md. Shamim Anower</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel knowledge distillation neural architecture leveraging efficient transformer networks for effective image classification. Natural images display intricate arrangements encompassing numerous extraneous elements. Vision transformers utilize localized patches to compute attention. However, exclusive dependence on patch segmentation proves inadequate in sufficiently encompassing the comprehensive nature of the image. To address this issue, we have proposed an inner-outer transformer-based architecture, which gives attention to the global and local aspects of the image. Moreover, The training of transformer models poses significant challenges due to their demanding resource, time, and data requirements. To tackle this, we integrate knowledge distillation into the architecture, enabling efficient learning. Leveraging insights from a larger teacher model, our approach enhances learning efficiency and effectiveness. Significantly, the transformer-in-transformer network acquires lightweight characteristics by means of distillation conducted within the feature extraction layer. Our featured network's robustness is established through substantial experimentation on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, demonstrating commendable top-1 and top-5 accuracy. The conducted ablative analysis comprehensively validates the effectiveness of the chosen parameters and settings, showcasing their superiority against contemporary methodologies. Remarkably, the proposed Transformer-in-Transformer Network (TITN) model achieves impressive performance milestones across various datasets: securing the highest top-1 accuracy of 74.71% and a top-5 accuracy of 92.28% for the CIFAR100 dataset, attaining an unparalleled top-1 accuracy of 92.03% and top-5 accuracy of 99.80% for the CIFAR-10 dataset, and registering an exceptional top-1 accuracy of 99.56% for the MNIST dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxuan Huang, Xili Dai, Jianan Wang, Xianbiao Qi, Yixing Yuan, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Room layout estimation from multiple-perspective images is poorly investigated due to the complexities that emerge from multi-view geometry, which requires muti-step solutions such as camera intrinsic and extrinsic estimation, image matching, and triangulation. However, in 3D reconstruction, the advancement of recent 3D foundation models such as DUSt3R has shifted the paradigm from the traditional multi-step structure-from-motion process to an end-to-end single-step approach. To this end, we introduce Plane-DUSt3R}, a novel method for multi-view room layout estimation leveraging the 3D foundation model DUSt3R. Plane-DUSt3R incorporates the DUSt3R framework and fine-tunes on a room layout dataset (Structure3D) with a modified objective to estimate structural planes. By generating uniform and parsimonious results, Plane-DUSt3R enables room layout estimation with only a single post-processing step and 2D detection results. Unlike previous methods that rely on single-perspective or panorama image, Plane-DUSt3R extends the setting to handle multiple-perspective images. Moreover, it offers a streamlined, end-to-end solution that simplifies the process and reduces error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that Plane-DUSt3R not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the synthetic dataset but also proves robust and effective on in the wild data with different image styles such as cartoon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangtao Shi, Ting Liu, Xiantao Hu, Yue Hu, Quanjun Yin, Richang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grounding aims to ground an image region through natural language, which heavily relies on cross-modal alignment. Most existing methods transfer visual/linguistic knowledge separately by fully fine-tuning uni-modal pre-trained models, followed by a simple stack of visual-language transformers for multimodal fusion. However, these approaches not only limit adequate interaction between visual and linguistic contexts, but also incur significant computational costs. Therefore, to address these issues, we explore a step-wise multimodal fusion and adaption framework, namely SwimVG. Specifically, SwimVG proposes step-wise multimodal prompts (Swip) and cross-modal interactive adapters (CIA) for visual grounding, replacing the cumbersome transformer stacks for multimodal fusion. Swip can improve {the} alignment between the vision and language representations step by step, in a token-level fusion manner. In addition, weight-level CIA further promotes multimodal fusion by cross-modal interaction. Swip and CIA are both parameter-efficient paradigms, and they fuse the cross-modal features from shallow to deep layers gradually. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that SwimVG achieves remarkable abilities and considerable benefits in terms of efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Most recently, learned image compression methods have outpaced traditional hand-crafted standard codecs. However, their inference typically requires to input the whole image at the cost of heavy computing resources, especially for high-resolution image compression; otherwise, the block artefact can exist when compressed by blocks within existing learned image compression methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel continuous patch stitching (CPS) framework for block-wise image compression that is able to achieve seamlessly patch stitching and mathematically eliminate block artefact, thus capable of significantly reducing the required computing resources when compressing images. More specifically, the proposed CPS framework is achieved by padding-free operations throughout, with a newly established parallel overlapping stitching strategy to provide a general upper bound for ensuring the continuity. Upon this, we further propose functional residual blocks with even-sized kernels to achieve down-sampling and up-sampling, together with bottleneck residual blocks retaining feature size to increase network depth. Experimental results demonstrate that our CPS framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance against existing baselines, whilst requiring less than half of computing resources of existing models.

<p>Abstract: The emerging semantic compression has been receiving increasing research efforts most recently, capable of achieving high fidelity restoration during compression, even at extremely low bitrates. However, existing semantic compression methods typically combine standard pipelines with either pre-defined or high-dimensional semantics, thus suffering from deficiency in compression. To address this issue, we propose a novel hierarchical semantic compression (HSC) framework that purely operates within intrinsic semantic spaces from generative models, which is able to achieve efficient compression for consistent semantic restoration. More specifically, we first analyse the entropy models for the semantic compression, which motivates us to employ a hierarchical architecture based on a newly developed general inversion encoder. Then, we propose the feature compression network (FCN) and semantic compression network (SCN), such that the middle-level semantic feature and core semantics are hierarchically compressed to restore both accuracy and consistency of image semantics, via an entropy model progressively shared by channel-wise context. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HSC framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on subjective quality and consistency for human vision, together with superior performances on machine vision tasks given compressed bitstreams. This essentially coincides with human visual system in understanding images, thus providing a new framework for future image/video compression paradigms.

<p>Abstract: Multi-object tracking under low-light environments is prevalent in real life. Recent years have seen rapid development in the field of multi-object tracking. However, due to the lack of datasets and the high cost of annotations, multi-object tracking under low-light environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we focus on multi-object tracking under low-light conditions. To address the issues of limited data and the lack of dataset, we first constructed a low-light multi-object tracking dataset (LLMOT). This dataset comprises data from MOT17 that has been enhanced for nighttime conditions as well as multiple unannotated low-light videos. Subsequently, to tackle the high annotation costs and address the issue of image quality degradation, we propose a semi-supervised multi-object tracking method based on consistency regularization named CRTrack. First, we calibrate a consistent adaptive sampling assignment to replace the static IoU-based strategy, enabling the semi-supervised tracking method to resist noisy pseudo-bounding boxes. Then, we design a adaptive semi-supervised network update method, which effectively leverages unannotated data to enhance model performance.

<p>Abstract: Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is a crucial task in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), aimed at retrieving and matching the same vehicle across different surveillance cameras. Numerous studies have explored methods to enhance vehicle Re-ID by focusing on semantic enhancement. However, these methods often rely on additional annotated information to enable models to extract effective semantic features, which brings many limitations. In this work, we propose a CLIP-based Semantic Enhancement Network (CLIP-SENet), an end-to-end framework designed to autonomously extract and refine vehicle semantic attributes, facilitating the generation of more robust semantic feature representations. Inspired by zero-shot solutions for downstream tasks presented by large-scale vision-language models, we leverage the powerful cross-modal descriptive capabilities of the CLIP image encoder to initially extract general semantic information. Instead of using a text encoder for semantic alignment, we design an adaptive fine-grained enhancement module (AFEM) to adaptively enhance this general semantic information at a fine-grained level to obtain robust semantic feature representations. These features are then fused with common Re-ID appearance features to further refine the distinctions between vehicles. Our comprehensive evaluation on three benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of CLIP-SENet. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with 92.9% mAP and 98.7% Rank-1 on VeRi-776 dataset, 90.4% Rank-1 and 98.7% Rank-5 on VehicleID dataset, and 89.1% mAP and 97.9% Rank-1 on the more challenging VeRi-Wild dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has shown great potential in medical image computing since it provides a decentralized learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to train a model collaboratively without privacy leakage. However, current studies have shown that data heterogeneity incurs local learning bias in classifiers and feature extractors of client models during local training, leading to the performance degradation of a federation system. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Federated Bias eliMinating (FedBM) to get rid of local learning bias in heterogeneous federated learning (FL), which mainly consists of two modules, i.e., Linguistic Knowledge-based Classifier Construction (LKCC) and Concept-guided Global Distribution Estimation (CGDE). Specifically, LKCC exploits class concepts, prompts and pre-trained language models (PLMs) to obtain concept embeddings. These embeddings are used to estimate the latent concept distribution of each class in the linguistic space. Based on the theoretical derivation, we can rely on these distributions to pre-construct a high-quality classifier for clients to achieve classification optimization, which is frozen to avoid classifier bias during local training. CGDE samples probabilistic concept embeddings from the latent concept distributions to learn a conditional generator to capture the input space of the global model. Three regularization terms are introduced to improve the quality and utility of the generator. The generator is shared by all clients and produces pseudo data to calibrate updates of local feature extractors. Extensive comparison experiments and ablation studies on public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FedBM over state-of-the-arts and confirm the effectiveness of each module, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dilermando Queiroz, Anderson Carlos, Andr\'e Anjos, Lilian Berton</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring equitable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare demands systems that make unbiased decisions across all demographic groups, bridging technical innovation with ethical principles. Foundation Models (FMs), trained on vast datasets through self-supervised learning, enable efficient adaptation across medical imaging tasks while reducing dependency on labeled data. These models demonstrate potential for enhancing fairness, though significant challenges remain in achieving consistent performance across demographic groups. Our review indicates that effective bias mitigation in FMs requires systematic interventions throughout all stages of development. While previous approaches focused primarily on model-level bias mitigation, our analysis reveals that fairness in FMs requires integrated interventions throughout the development pipeline, from data documentation to deployment protocols. This comprehensive framework advances current knowledge by demonstrating how systematic bias mitigation, combined with policy engagement, can effectively address both technical and institutional barriers to equitable AI in healthcare. The development of equitable FMs represents a critical step toward democratizing advanced healthcare technologies, particularly for underserved populations and regions with limited medical infrastructure and computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaqi Sun, Kyohei Atarashi, Koh Takeuchi, Hisashi Kashima</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) integrate image encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs) to process multi-modal inputs and perform complex visual tasks. However, they often generate hallucinations by describing non-existent objects or attributes, compromising their reliability. This study analyzes hallucination patterns in image captioning, showing that not all tokens in the generation process are influenced by image input and that image dependency can serve as a useful signal for hallucination detection. To address this, we develop an automated pipeline to identify hallucinated objects and train a token-level classifier using hidden representations from parallel inference passes-with and without image input. Leveraging this classifier, we introduce a decoding strategy that effectively controls hallucination rates in image captioning at inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trevine Oorloff, Yaser Yacoob, Abhinav Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models, while increasingly adept at generating realistic images, are notably hindered by hallucinations -- unrealistic or incorrect features inconsistent with the trained data distribution. In this work, we propose Adaptive Attention Modulation (AAM), a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations by analyzing and modulating the self-attention mechanism in diffusion models. We hypothesize that self-attention during early denoising steps may inadvertently amplify or suppress features, contributing to hallucinations. To counter this, AAM introduces a temperature scaling mechanism within the softmax operation of the self-attention layers, dynamically modulating the attention distribution during inference. Additionally, AAM employs a masked perturbation technique to disrupt early-stage noise that may otherwise propagate into later stages as hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AAM effectively reduces hallucinatory artifacts, enhancing both the fidelity and reliability of generated images. For instance, the proposed approach improves the FID score by 20.8% and reduces the percentage of hallucinated images by 12.9% (in absolute terms) on the Hands dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiping Lin, Shen Liu, Runchen Zhu, Liansheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) extract valuable discriminative features from images for downstream clinical tasks. PFMs have simplified the development of deep learning models, effectively leveraging prior knowledge to improve diagnostic accuracy in diverse scenarios. However, we find that PFMs sometimes struggle with certain challenges. Specifically, features extracted by PFMs are often contaminated by diagnosis-irrelevant information, i.e., institution-specific features associated with the images. This contamination can lead to spurious correlations, undermining the models' generalization ability when applied in real-world clinical settings. In this work, we first reveal the issue of feature contamination in PFMs, demonstrate the presence of institution-specific features, thoroughly investigate its negative impacts, analyze the underlying causes, and provide insights into potential solutions. Specifically, we find that institution-specific information is embedded in pathological images and can be readily captured by current PFMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the detrimental impact of this irrelevant information, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, where reliance on contaminated features leads to significant performance degradation. This indicates that the models are being misled by non-diagnostic information. We further delve into the reasons PFMs extract such institution-specific information and validate our findings. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective solution to mitigate the influence of irrelevant information. This study is not intended to criticize existing PFMs, as they have indeed greatly advanced the development of computational pathology. our aim is to inspire future research to focus on innovative training strategies, rather than relying exclusively on scaling laws, to realize more generalized PFMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suchae Jeong, Inseong Choi, Youngsik Yun, Jihie Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image models, including Stable Diffusion, have significantly improved in generating images that are highly semantically aligned with the given prompts. However, existing models may fail to produce appropriate images for the cultural concepts or objects that are not well known or underrepresented in western cultures, such as `hangari' (Korean utensil). In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Culturally-Aware Text-to-Image Generation with Iterative Prompt Refinement (Culture-TRIP), which refines the prompt in order to improve the alignment of the image with such culture nouns in text-to-image models. Our approach (1) retrieves cultural contexts and visual details related to the culture nouns in the prompt and (2) iteratively refines and evaluates the prompt based on a set of cultural criteria and large language models. The refinement process utilizes the information retrieved from Wikipedia and the Web. Our user survey, conducted with 66 participants from eight different countries demonstrates that our proposed approach enhances the alignment between the images and the prompts. In particular, C-TRIP demonstrates improved alignment between the generated images and underrepresented culture nouns. Resource can be found at https://shane3606.github.io/Culture-TRIP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiehao Luo, Jintao Cheng, Xiaoyu Tang, Qingwen Zhang, Bohuan Xue, Rui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene flow estimation aims to predict 3D motion from consecutive point cloud frames, which is of great interest in autonomous driving field. Existing methods face challenges such as insufficient spatio-temporal modeling and inherent loss of fine-grained feature during voxelization. However, the success of Mamba, a representative state space model (SSM) that enables global modeling with linear complexity, provides a promising solution. In this paper, we propose MambaFlow, a novel scene flow estimation network with a mamba-based decoder. It enables deep interaction and coupling of spatio-temporal features using a well-designed backbone. Innovatively, we steer the global attention modeling of voxel-based features with point offset information using an efficient Mamba-based decoder, learning voxel-to-point patterns that are used to devoxelize shared voxel representations into point-wise features. To further enhance the model's generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios, we propose a novel scene-adaptive loss function that automatically adapts to different motion patterns.Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that MambaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed among existing works, enabling accurate flow estimation in real-world urban scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Miller, Samarth Mishra, Aditya Gangrade, Kate Saenko, Venkatesh Saligrama</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot multi-label recognition (MLR) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) faces significant challenges without training data, model tuning, or architectural modifications. Existing approaches require prompt tuning or architectural adaptations, limiting zero-shot applicability. Our work proposes a novel solution treating VLMs as black boxes, leveraging scores without training data or ground truth. Using large language model insights on object co-occurrence, we introduce compound prompts grounded in realistic object combinations. Analysis of these prompt scores reveals VLM biases and ``AND''/``OR'' signal ambiguities, notably that maximum compound scores are surprisingly suboptimal compared to second-highest scores. We address these through a debiasing and score-fusion algorithm that corrects image bias and clarifies VLM response behaviors. Our method enhances other zero-shot approaches, consistently improving their results. Experiments show superior mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to methods requiring training data, achieved through refined object ranking for robust zero-shot MLR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kedi Lyu, Haipeng Chen, Zhenguang Liu, Yifang Yin, Yukang Lin, Yingying Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Grasping the intricacies of human motion, which involve perceiving spatio-temporal dependence and multi-scale effects, is essential for predicting human motion. While humans inherently possess the requisite skills to navigate this issue, it proves to be markedly more challenging for machines to emulate. To bridge the gap, we propose the Human-like Vision and Inference System (HVIS) for human motion prediction, which is designed to emulate human observation and forecast future movements. HVIS comprises two components: the human-like vision encode (HVE) module and the human-like motion inference (HMI) module. The HVE module mimics and refines the human visual process, incorporating a retina-analog component that captures spatiotemporal information separately to avoid unnecessary crosstalk. Additionally, a visual cortex-analogy component is designed to hierarchically extract and treat complex motion features, focusing on both global and local features of human poses. The HMI is employed to simulate the multi-stage learning model of the human brain. The spontaneous learning network simulates the neuronal fracture generation process for the adversarial generation of future motions. Subsequently, the deliberate learning network is optimized for hard-to-train joints to prevent misleading learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods by 19.8% on Human3.6M, 15.7% on CMU Mocap, and 11.1% on G3D.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have spurred the development of text-to-3D asset (T23DA) generation, leveraging pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion models for text-to-3D asset synthesis. Despite the growing popularity of text-to-3D asset generation, its evaluation has not been well considered and studied. However, given the significant quality discrepancies among various text-to-3D assets, there is a pressing need for quality assessment models aligned with human subjective judgments. To tackle this challenge, we conduct a comprehensive study to explore the T23DA quality assessment (T23DAQA) problem in this work from both subjective and objective perspectives. Given the absence of corresponding databases, we first establish the largest text-to-3D asset quality assessment database to date, termed the AIGC-T23DAQA database. This database encompasses 969 validated 3D assets generated from 170 prompts via 6 popular text-to-3D asset generation models, and corresponding subjective quality ratings for these assets from the perspectives of quality, authenticity, and text-asset correspondence, respectively. Subsequently, we establish a comprehensive benchmark based on the AIGC-T23DAQA database, and devise an effective T23DAQA model to evaluate the generated 3D assets from the aforementioned three perspectives, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instance-level change detection in 3D scenes presents significant challenges, particularly in uncontrolled environments lacking labeled image pairs, consistent camera poses, or uniform lighting conditions. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel approach for detecting changes in real-world scenarios. Our method leverages 4D Gaussians to embed multiple images into Gaussian distributions, enabling the rendering of two coherent image sequences. We segment each image and assign unique identifiers to instances, facilitating efficient change detection through ID comparison. Additionally, we utilize change maps and classification encodings to categorize 4D Gaussians as changed or unchanged, allowing for the rendering of comprehensive change maps from any viewpoint. Extensive experiments across various instance-level change detection datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like C-NERF and CYWS-3D, especially in scenarios with substantial lighting variations. Our approach offers improved detection accuracy, robustness to lighting changes, and efficient processing times, advancing the field of 3D change detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farzad Beizaee, Gregory Lodygensky, Christian Desrosiers, Jose Dolz</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection in brain images is crucial for identifying injuries and pathologies without access to labels. However, the accurate localization of anomalies in medical images remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of brain structures and the scarcity of annotated abnormal data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that incorporates masking within diffusion models, leveraging their generative capabilities to learn robust representations of normal brain anatomy. During training, our model processes only normal brain MRI scans and performs a forward diffusion process in the latent space that adds noise to the features of randomly-selected patches. Following a dual objective, the model learns to identify which patches are noisy and recover their original features. This strategy ensures that the model captures intricate patterns of normal brain structures while isolating potential anomalies as noise in the latent space. At inference, the model identifies noisy patches corresponding to anomalies and generates a normal counterpart for these patches by applying a reverse diffusion process. Our method surpasses existing unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, demonstrating superior performance in generating accurate normal counterparts and localizing anomalies.

<p>Abstract: In agricultural research, there has been a recent surge in the amount of Computer Vision (CV) focused work. But unlike general CV research, large high-quality public datasets are sparsely available. This can be partially attributed to the high variability between different agricultural tasks, crops and environments as well as the complexity of data collection, but it is also influenced by the reticence to publish datasets by many authors. This, as well as the lack of a widely used agricultural data repository, are impactful factors that hinder research in applied CV for agriculture as well as the usage of agricultural data in general-purpose CV research. In this survey, we provide a large number of high-quality datasets of images taken on fields. Overall, we find 45 datasets, which are listed in this paper as well as in an online catalog on the project website: https://smartfarminglab.github.io/field_dataset_survey/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miaomiao Cai, Guanjie Wang, Wei Li, Zhijun Tu, Hanting Chen, Shaohui Lin, Jie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of autoregressive (AR) image generation, models based on the 'next-token prediction' paradigm of LLMs have shown comparable performance to diffusion models by reducing inductive biases. However, directly applying LLMs to complex image generation can struggle with reconstructing the structure and details of the image, impacting the accuracy and stability of generation. Additionally, the 'next-token prediction' paradigm in the AR model does not align with the contextual scanning and logical reasoning processes involved in human visual perception, limiting effective image generation. Chain-of-Thought (CoT), as a key reasoning capability of LLMs, utilizes reasoning prompts to guide the model, improving reasoning performance on complex natural language process (NLP) tasks, enhancing accuracy and stability of generation, and helping the model maintain contextual coherence and logical consistency, similar to human reasoning. Inspired by CoT from the field of NLP, we propose autoregressive Image Generation with Thoughtful Reasoning (IGTR) to enhance autoregressive image generation. IGTR adds reasoning prompts without modifying the model structure or raster generation order. Specifically, we design specialized image-related reasoning prompts for AR image generation to simulate the human reasoning process, which enhances contextual reasoning by allowing the model to first perceive overall distribution information before generating the image, and improve generation stability by increasing the inference steps. Compared to the AR method without prompts, our method shows outstanding performance and achieves an approximate improvement of 20%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangkai Wu, Xuhui Fan, Hongyu Wu, Longbing Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Majorities of distillation methods on pre-trained diffusion models or on pre-trained rectified flow, focus on either the distillation outputs or the trajectories between random noises and clean images to speed up sample generations from pre-trained models. In those trajectory-based distillation methods, consistency distillation requires the self-consistent trajectory projection to regulate the trajectory, which might avoid the common ODE approximation error {while still be concerning about sampling efficiencies}. At the same time, rectified flow distillations enforce straight trajectory for fast sampling, although an ODE solver is still required. In this work, we propose a trajectory distillation method, \modelname, that enjoys the benefits of both and enables few-step generations. TraFlow adopts the settings of consistency trajectory models, and further enforces the properties of self-consistency and straightness throughout the entire trajectory. These two properties are pursued by reaching a balance with following three targets: (1) reconstruct the output from pre-trained models; (2) learn the amount of changes by pre-trained models; (3) satisfy the self-consistency over its trajectory. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artistic style transfer is concerned with the generation of imagery that combines the content of an image with the style of an artwork. In the realm of computer games, most work has focused on post-processing video frames. Some recent work has integrated style transfer into the game pipeline, but it is limited to single styles. Integrating an arbitrary style transfer method into the game pipeline is challenging due to the memory and speed requirements of games. We present PQDAST, the first solution to address this. We use a perceptual quality-guided knowledge distillation framework and train a compressed model using the FLIP evaluator, which substantially reduces both memory usage and processing time with limited impact on stylisation quality. For better preservation of depth and fine details, we utilise a synthetic dataset with depth and temporal considerations during training. The developed model is injected into the rendering pipeline to further enforce temporal stability and avoid diminishing post-process effects. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in temporal consistency, with comparable style transfer quality, to state-of-the-art image, video and in-game methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreya Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced deep-learning models designed to understand and generate human language. They work together with models that process data like images, enabling cross-modal understanding. However, existing approaches often suffer from the echo chamber effect, where redundant visual patterns reduce model generalization and accuracy. Thus, the proposed system considered this limitation and developed an enhanced LLM-based framework for cross-modal query understanding using DL-KeyBERT-based CAZSSCL-MPGPT. The collected dataset consists of pre-processed images and texts. The preprocessed images then undergo object segmentation using Easom-You Only Look Once (E-YOLO). The object skeleton is generated, along with the knowledge graph using a Conditional Random Knowledge Graph (CRKG) technique. Further, features are extracted from the knowledge graph, generated skeletons, and segmented objects. The optimal features are then selected using the Fossa Optimization Algorithm (FOA). Meanwhile, the text undergoes word embedding using DL-KeyBERT. Finally, the cross-modal query understanding system utilizes CAZSSCL-MPGPT to generate accurate and contextually relevant image descriptions as text. The proposed CAZSSCL-MPGPT achieved an accuracy of 99.14187362% in the COCO dataset 2017 and 98.43224393% in the vqav2-val dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) collaborative perception leverages data collected by infrastructure's sensors to enhance vehicle perceptual capabilities. LiDAR, as a commonly used sensor in cooperative perception, is widely equipped in intelligent vehicles and infrastructure. However, its superior performance comes with a correspondingly high cost. To achieve low-cost V2I, reducing the cost of LiDAR is crucial. Therefore, we study adopting low-resolution LiDAR on the vehicle to minimize cost as much as possible. However, simply reducing the resolution of vehicle's LiDAR results in sparse point clouds, making distant small objects even more blurred. Additionally, traditional communication methods have relatively low bandwidth utilization efficiency. These factors pose challenges for us. To balance cost and perceptual accuracy, we propose a new collaborative perception framework, namely LCV2I. LCV2I uses data collected from cameras and low-resolution LiDAR as input. It also employs feature offset correction modules and regional feature enhancement algorithms to improve feature representation. Finally, we use regional difference map and regional score map to assess the value of collaboration content, thereby improving communication bandwidth efficiency. In summary, our approach achieves high perceptual performance while substantially reducing the demand for high-resolution sensors on the vehicle. To evaluate this algorithm, we conduct 3D object detection in the real-world scenario of DAIR-V2X, demonstrating that the performance of LCV2I consistently surpasses currently existing algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Zhu, Honghua Chen, Xing He, Mingqiang Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental yet not well-solved problem in 3D vision. Current approaches often rely on 3D coordinate information and/or additional data (e.g., images and scanning viewpoints) to fill in missing parts. Unlike these methods, we explore self-structure augmentation and propose PointSea for global-to-local point cloud completion. In the global stage, consider how we inspect a defective region of a physical object, we may observe it from various perspectives for a better understanding. Inspired by this, PointSea augments data representation by leveraging self-projected depth images from multiple views. To reconstruct a compact global shape from the cross-modal input, we incorporate a feature fusion module to fuse features at both intra-view and inter-view levels. In the local stage, to reveal highly detailed structures, we introduce a point generator called the self-structure dual-generator. This generator integrates both learned shape priors and geometric self-similarities for shape refinement. Unlike existing efforts that apply a unified strategy for all points, our dual-path design adapts refinement strategies conditioned on the structural type of each point, addressing the specific incompleteness of each point. Comprehensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that PointSea effectively understands global shapes and generates local details from incomplete input, showing clear improvements over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wendi Liu, Pei Yang, Wenhui Hong, Xiaoguang Mei, Jiayi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In hyperspectral remote sensing field, some downstream dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation (SS) and change detection (CD), rely on supervised learning to improve model performance and require a large amount of manually annotated data for training. However, due to the needs of specific equipment and special application scenarios, the acquisition and annotation of hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often costly and time-consuming. To this end, our work explores the potential of generative diffusion model in synthesizing HSIs with pixel-level annotations. The main idea is to utilize a two-stream VAE to learn the latent representations of images and corresponding masks respectively, learn their joint distribution during the diffusion model training, and finally obtain the image and mask through their respective decoders. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to generate high-dimensional HSIs with annotations. Our proposed approach can be applied in various kinds of dataset generation. We select two of the most widely used dense prediction tasks: semantic segmentation and change detection, and generate datasets suitable for these tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our synthetic datasets have a positive impact on the improvement of these downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Fayad, Max Zimmer, Martin Schwartz, Philippe Ciais, Fabian Gieseke, Gabriel Belouze, Sarah Brood, Aurelien De Truchis, Alexandre d'Aspremont</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant efforts have been directed towards adapting self-supervised multimodal learning for Earth observation applications. However, existing methods produce coarse patch-sized embeddings, limiting their effectiveness and integration with other modalities like LiDAR. To close this gap, we present DUNIA, an approach to learn pixel-sized embeddings through cross-modal alignment between images and full-waveform LiDAR data. As the model is trained in a contrastive manner, the embeddings can be directly leveraged in the context of a variety of environmental monitoring tasks in a zero-shot setting. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the embeddings for seven such tasks (canopy height mapping, fractional canopy cover, land cover mapping, tree species identification, plant area index, crop type classification, and per-pixel waveform-based vertical structure mapping). The results show that the embeddings, along with zero-shot classifiers, often outperform specialized supervised models, even in low data regimes. In the fine-tuning setting, we show strong low-shot capabilities with performances near or better than state-of-the-art on five out of six tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bolin Chen, Hanwei Zhu, Shanzhi Yin, Lingyu Zhu, Jie Chen, Ru-Ling Liao, Shiqi Wang, Yan Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative model based compact video compression is typically operated within a relative narrow range of bitrates, and often with an emphasis on ultra-low rate applications. There has been an increasing consensus in the video communication industry that full bitrate coverage should be enabled by generative coding. However, this is an extremely difficult task, largely because generation and compression, although related, have distinct goals and trade-offs. The proposed Pleno-Generation (PGen) framework distinguishes itself through its exceptional capabilities in ensuring the robustness of video coding by utilizing a wider range of bandwidth for generation via bandwidth intelligence. In particular, we initiate our research of PGen with face video coding, and PGen offers a paradigm shift that prioritizes high-fidelity reconstruction over pursuing compact bitstream. The novel PGen framework leverages scalable representation and layered reconstruction for Generative Face Video Compression (GFVC), in an attempt to imbue the bitstream with intelligence in different granularity. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed PGen framework can facilitate existing GFVC algorithms to better deliver high-fidelity and faithful face videos. In addition, the proposed framework can allow a greater space of flexibility for coding applications and show superior RD performance with a much wider bitrate range in terms of various quality evaluations. Moreover, in comparison with the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) codec, the proposed scheme achieves competitive Bj{\o}ntegaard-delta-rate savings for perceptual-level evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Abdul Gaffar Shakhadri, Kruthika KR, Kartik Basavaraj Angadi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Shakti VLM, a family of vision-language models in the capacity of 1B and 4B parameters designed to address data efficiency challenges in multimodal learning. While recent VLMs achieve strong performance through extensive training data, Shakti models leverage architectural innovations to attain competitive results with fewer tokens. Key advancements include QK-Normalization for attention stability, hybrid normalization techniques, and enhanced positional encoding. A three-stage training strategy further optimizes learning efficiency. Evaluations show that Shakti-Shakti-VLM-1B and Shakti-VLM-4B excel in document understanding, Visual Reasoning, OCR extraction, and general multimodal reasoning. Our results highlight that high performance can be achieved through model design and training strategy rather than sheer data volume, making Shakti an efficient solution for enterprise-scale multimodal tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world image matting is essential for applications in content creation and augmented reality. However, it remains challenging due to the complex nature of scenes and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce Mask2Alpha, an iterative refinement framework designed to enhance semantic comprehension, instance awareness, and fine-detail recovery in image matting. Our framework leverages self-supervised Vision Transformer features as semantic priors, strengthening contextual understanding in complex scenarios. To further improve instance differentiation, we implement a mask-guided feature selection module, enabling precise targeting of objects in multi-instance settings. Additionally, a sparse convolution-based optimization scheme allows Mask2Alpha to recover high-resolution details through progressive refinement,from low-resolution semantic passes to high-resolution sparse reconstructions. Benchmarking across various real-world datasets, Mask2Alpha consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its effectiveness in accurate and efficient image matting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seoyeon Gye, Junwon Ko, Hyounguk Shon, Minchan Kwon, Junmo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying AI-generated content is critical for the safe and ethical use of generative AI. Recent research has focused on developing detectors that generalize to unknown generators, with popular methods relying either on high-level features or low-level fingerprints. However, these methods have clear limitations: biased towards unseen content, or vulnerable to common image degradations, such as JPEG compression. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, SFLD, which incorporates PatchShuffle to integrate high-level semantic and low-level textural information. SFLD applies PatchShuffle at multiple levels, improving robustness and generalization across various generative models. Additionally, current benchmarks face challenges such as low image quality, insufficient content preservation, and limited class diversity. In response, we introduce TwinSynths, a new benchmark generation methodology that constructs visually near-identical pairs of real and synthetic images to ensure high quality and content preservation. Our extensive experiments and analysis show that SFLD outperforms existing methods on detecting a wide variety of fake images sourced from GANs, diffusion models, and TwinSynths, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance and generalization capabilities to novel generative models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17154">MaxGlaViT: A novel lightweight vision transformer-based approach for early diagnosis of glaucoma stages from fundus images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Yurdakul, Kubra Uyar, Sakir Tasdemir</p>
<p>Abstract: Glaucoma is a prevalent eye disease that progresses silently without symptoms. If not detected and treated early, it can cause permanent vision loss. Computer-assisted diagnosis systems play a crucial role in timely and efficient identification. This study introduces MaxGlaViT, a lightweight model based on the restructured Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) for early glaucoma detection. First, MaxViT was scaled to optimize block and channel numbers, resulting in a lighter architecture. Second, the stem was enhanced by adding attention mechanisms (CBAM, ECA, SE) after convolution layers to improve feature learning. Third, MBConv structures in MaxViT blocks were replaced by advanced DL blocks (ConvNeXt, ConvNeXtV2, InceptionNeXt). The model was evaluated using the HDV1 dataset, containing fundus images of different glaucoma stages. Additionally, 40 CNN and 40 ViT models were tested on HDV1 to validate MaxGlaViT's efficiency. Among CNN models, EfficientB6 achieved the highest accuracy (84.91%), while among ViT models, MaxViT-Tiny performed best (86.42%). The scaled MaxViT reached 87.93% accuracy. Adding ECA to the stem block increased accuracy to 89.01%. Replacing MBConv with ConvNeXtV2 further improved it to 89.87%. Finally, integrating ECA in the stem and ConvNeXtV2 in MaxViT blocks resulted in 92.03% accuracy. Testing 80 DL models for glaucoma stage classification, this study presents a comprehensive and comparative analysis. MaxGlaViT outperforms experimental and state-of-the-art models, achieving 92.03% accuracy, 92.33% precision, 92.03% recall, 92.13% f1-score, and 87.12% Cohen's kappa score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Canyu Zhao, Mingyu Liu, Huanyi Zheng, Muzhi Zhu, Zhiyue Zhao, Hao Chen, Tong He, Chunhua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Our primary goal here is to create a good, generalist perception model that can tackle multiple tasks, within limits on computational resources and training data. To achieve this, we resort to text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on billions of images. Our exhaustive evaluation metrics demonstrate that DICEPTION effectively tackles multiple perception tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art models. We achieve results on par with SAM-vit-h using only 0.06% of their data (e.g., 600K vs. 1B pixel-level annotated images). Inspired by Wang et al., DICEPTION formulates the outputs of various perception tasks using color encoding; and we show that the strategy of assigning random colors to different instances is highly effective in both entity segmentation and semantic segmentation. Unifying various perception tasks as conditional image generation enables us to fully leverage pre-trained text-to-image models. Thus, DICEPTION can be efficiently trained at a cost of orders of magnitude lower, compared to conventional models that were trained from scratch. When adapting our model to other tasks, it only requires fine-tuning on as few as 50 images and 1% of its parameters. DICEPTION provides valuable insights and a more promising solution for visual generalist models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanhu Zeng, Haiyang Guo, Fei Zhu, Li Shen, Hao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models with custom data leads to numerous expert models on specific tasks. Merging models into one universal model to empower multi-task ability refraining from data leakage has gained popularity. With the expansion in data and model size, parameter efficient tuning becomes the common practice for obtaining task-specific models efficiently. However, we observe that existing methods designed for full fine-tuning merging fail under efficient tuning. To address the issues, we analyze from low-rank decomposition and reveal that maintaining direction and compensating for gap between singular values are crucial for efficient model merging. Consequently, we propose CoPA-Merging, a training-free parameter efficient merging method with complementary parameter adaptation. Specifically, we (1) prune parameters and construct scaling coefficients from inter-parameter relation to compensate for performance drop from task interference and (2) perform cross-task normalization to enhance unseen task generalization. We establish a benchmark consisting of diverse multimodal tasks, on which we conduct experiments to certificate the outstanding performance and generalizability of our method. Additional study and extensive analyses further showcase the effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuli Wu, Fucheng Liu, R\"uveyda Yilmaz, Henning Konermann, Peter Walter, Johannes Stegmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), computed with an ImageNet pretrained Inception-v3 network, is widely used as a state-of-the-art evaluation metric for generative models. It assumes that feature vectors from Inception-v3 follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution and calculates the 2-Wasserstein distance based on their means and covariances. While FID effectively measures how closely synthetic data match real data in many image synthesis tasks, the primary goal in biomedical generative models is often to enrich training datasets ideally with corresponding annotations. For this purpose, the gold standard for evaluating generative models is to incorporate synthetic data into downstream task training, such as classification and segmentation, to pragmatically assess its performance. In this paper, we examine cases from retinal imaging modalities, including color fundus photography and optical coherence tomography, where FID and its related metrics misalign with task-specific evaluation goals in classification and segmentation. We highlight the limitations of using various metrics, represented by FID and its variants, as evaluation criteria for these applications and address their potential caveats in broader biomedical imaging modalities and downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual transformers have achieved remarkable performance in image classification tasks, but this performance gain has come at the cost of interpretability. One of the main obstacles to the interpretation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which mixes visual information across the whole image in a complex way. In this paper, we propose Hindered Transformer (HiT), a novel interpretable by design architecture inspired by visual transformers. Our proposed architecture rethinks the design of transformers to better disentangle patch influences at the classification stage. Ultimately, HiT can be interpreted as a linear combination of patch-level information. We show that the advantages of our approach in terms of explicability come with a reasonable trade-off in performance, making it an attractive alternative for applications where interpretability is paramount.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Dimitra, a novel framework for audio-driven talking head generation, streamlined to learn lip motion, facial expression, as well as head pose motion. Specifically, we train a conditional Motion Diffusion Transformer (cMDT) by modeling facial motion sequences with 3D representation. We condition the cMDT with only two input signals, an audio-sequence, as well as a reference facial image. By extracting additional features directly from audio, Dimitra is able to increase quality and realism of generated videos. In particular, phoneme sequences contribute to the realism of lip motion, whereas text transcript to facial expression and head pose realism. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on two widely employed datasets, VoxCeleb2 and HDTF, showcase that Dimitra is able to outperform existing approaches for generating realistic talking heads imparting lip motion, facial expression, and head pose.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieving images from the same location as a given query is an important component of multiple computer vision tasks, like Visual Place Recognition, Landmark Retrieval, Visual Localization, 3D reconstruction, and SLAM. However, existing solutions are built to specifically work for one of these tasks, and are known to fail when the requirements slightly change or when they meet out-of-distribution data. In this paper we combine a variety of existing methods, training techniques, and datasets to train a retrieval model, called MegaLoc, that is performant on multiple tasks. We find that MegaLoc (1) achieves state of the art on a large number of Visual Place Recognition datasets, (2) impressive results on common Landmark Retrieval datasets, and (3) sets a new state of the art for Visual Localization on the LaMAR datasets, where we only changed the retrieval method to the existing localization pipeline.

<p>Abstract: Gait refers to the patterns of limb movement generated during walking, which are unique to each individual due to both physical and behavioural traits. Walking patterns have been widely studied in biometrics, biomechanics, sports, and rehabilitation. While traditional methods rely on video and motion capture, advances in underfoot pressure sensing technology now offer deeper insights into gait. However, underfoot pressures during walking remain underexplored due to the lack of large, publicly accessible datasets. To address this, the UNB StepUP database was created, featuring gait pressure data collected with high-resolution pressure sensing tiles (4 sensors/cm\textsuperscript{2}, 1.2m by 3.6m). Its first release, UNB StepUP-P150, includes over 200,000 footsteps from 150 individuals across various walking speeds (preferred, slow-to-stop, fast, and slow) and footwear types (barefoot, standard shoes, and two personal shoes). As the largest and most comprehensive dataset of its kind, it supports biometric gait recognition while presenting new research opportunities in biomechanics and deep learning. The UNB StepUP-P150 dataset sets a new benchmark for pressure-based gait analysis and recognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video generation and editing capabilities. However, multi-grained video editing, which encompasses class-level, instance-level, and part-level modifications, remains a formidable challenge. The major difficulties in multi-grained editing include semantic misalignment of text-to-region control and feature coupling within the diffusion model. To address these difficulties, we present VideoGrain, a zero-shot approach that modulates space-time (cross- and self-) attention mechanisms to achieve fine-grained control over video content. We enhance text-to-region control by amplifying each local prompt's attention to its corresponding spatial-disentangled region while minimizing interactions with irrelevant areas in cross-attention. Additionally, we improve feature separation by increasing intra-region awareness and reducing inter-region interference in self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Boeder, Fabian Gigengack, Benjamin Risse</p>
<p>Abstract: Occupancy estimation has become a prominent task in 3D computer vision, particularly within the autonomous driving community. In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karan Samel, Nitish Sontakke, Irfan Essa</p>
<p>Abstract: Instructional videos provide a convenient modality to learn new tasks (ex. cooking a recipe, or assembling furniture). A viewer will want to find a corresponding video that reflects both the overall task they are interested in as well as contains the relevant steps they need to carry out the task. To perform this, an instructional video model should be capable of inferring both the tasks and the steps that occur in an input video. Doing this efficiently and in a generalizable fashion is key when compute or relevant video topics used to train this model are limited. To address these requirements we explicitly mine task hierarchies and the procedural steps associated with instructional videos. We use this prior knowledge to pre-train our model, $\texttt{Pivot}$, for step and task prediction. During pre-training, we also provide video augmentation and early stopping strategies to optimally identify which model to use for downstream tasks. We test this pre-trained model on task recognition, step recognition, and step prediction tasks on two downstream datasets. When pre-training data and compute are limited, we outperform previous baselines along these tasks. Therefore, leveraging prior task and step structures enables efficient training of $\texttt{Pivot}$ for instructional video recommendation.</p>

<p>Abstract: How can we verify whether copyrighted content was used to train a large vision-language model (VLM) without direct access to its training data? Motivated by the hypothesis that a VLM is able to recognize images from its training corpus, we propose DIS-CO, a novel approach to infer the inclusion of copyrighted content during the model's development. By repeatedly querying a VLM with specific frames from targeted copyrighted material, DIS-CO extracts the content's identity through free-form text completions. To assess its effectiveness, we introduce MovieTection, a benchmark comprising 14,000 frames paired with detailed captions, drawn from films released both before and after a model's training cutoff. Our results show that DIS-CO significantly improves detection performance, nearly doubling the average AUC of the best prior method on models with logits available. Our findings also highlight a broader concern: all tested models appear to have been exposed to some extent to copyrighted content.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianrui Zhu, Shiyi Zhang, Jiawei Shao, Yansong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Background consistency remains a significant challenge in image editing tasks. Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off between maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content that aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach that uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background tokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex mechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that seamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We further explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and optimize the space complexity to $O(1)$ using an inversion-free method. Our approach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that KV-Edit significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both background and image quality, even surpassing training-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stella Dumen\v{c}i\'c, Luka Lan\v{c}a, Karlo Jakac, Stefan Ivi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Search and rescue (SAR) missions require reliable search methods to locate survivors, especially in challenging or inaccessible environments. This is why introducing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be of great help to enhance the efficiency of SAR missions while simultaneously increasing the safety of everyone involved in the mission. Motivated by this, we design and experiment with autonomous UAV search for humans in a Mediterranean karst environment. The UAVs are directed using Heat equation-driven area coverage (HEDAC) ergodic control method according to known probability density and detection function. The implemented sensing framework consists of a probabilistic search model, motion control system, and computer vision object detection. It enables calculation of the probability of the target being detected in the SAR mission, and this paper focuses on experimental validation of proposed probabilistic framework and UAV control. The uniform probability density to ensure the even probability of finding the targets in the desired search area is achieved by assigning suitably thought-out tasks to 78 volunteers. The detection model is based on YOLO and trained with a previously collected ortho-photo image database. The experimental search is carefully planned and conducted, while as many parameters as possible are recorded. The thorough analysis consists of the motion control system, object detection, and the search validation. The assessment of the detection and search performance provides strong indication that the designed detection model in the UAV control algorithm is aligned with real-world results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chong Cheng, Gaochao Song, Yiyang Yao, Qinzheng Zhou, Gangjian Zhang, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates an open research challenge of reconstructing high-quality, large 3D open scenes from images. It is observed existing methods have various limitations, such as requiring precise camera poses for input and dense viewpoints for supervision. To perform effective and efficient 3D scene reconstruction, we propose a novel graph-guided 3D scene reconstruction framework, GraphGS. Specifically, given a set of images captured by RGB cameras on a scene, we first design a spatial prior-based scene structure estimation method. This is then used to create a camera graph that includes information about the camera topology. Further, we propose to apply the graph-guided multi-view consistency constraint and adaptive sampling strategy to the 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization process. This greatly alleviates the issue of Gaussian points overfitting to specific sparse viewpoints and expedites the 3D reconstruction process. We demonstrate GraphGS achieves high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from images, which presents state-of-the-art performance through quantitative and qualitative evaluation across multiple datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Chen, Hongyi Xu, Guoxian Song, You Xie, Chenxu Zhang, Xin Chen, Chao Wang, Di Chang, Linjie Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: We present X-Dancer, a novel zero-shot music-driven image animation pipeline that creates diverse and long-range lifelike human dance videos from a single static image. As its core, we introduce a unified transformer-diffusion framework, featuring an autoregressive transformer model that synthesize extended and music-synchronized token sequences for 2D body, head and hands poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human motion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment with musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this, we first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human pose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large articulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained motions (e.g., head and hands). We then design a music-to-motion transformer model that autoregressively generates music-aligned dance pose token sequences, incorporating global attention to both musical style and prior motion context. Finally we leverage a diffusion backbone to animate the reference image with these synthesized pose tokens through AdaIN, forming a fully differentiable end-to-end framework. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Dancer is able to produce both diverse and characterized dance videos, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods in term of diversity, expressiveness and realism. Code and model will be available for research purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Zhang, Mahyar Khayatkhoei, Prateek Chhikara, Filip Ilievski</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid progress in visual recognition tasks in recent years. Given their potential integration into many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations of their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive small visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions about images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in fact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention patterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that they consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer. Based on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention methods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of attention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details. We evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual question answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve MLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. Our results elucidate the risk of applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and indicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a promising direction to mitigate this risk.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17425">Introducing Visual Perception Token into Multimodal Large Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Runpeng Yu, Xinyin Ma, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: To utilize visual information, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) relies on the perception process of its vision encoder. The completeness and accuracy of visual perception significantly influence the precision of spatial reasoning, fine-grained understanding, and other tasks. However, MLLM still lacks the autonomous capability to control its own visual perception processes, for example, selectively reviewing specific regions of an image or focusing on information related to specific object categories. In this work, we propose the concept of Visual Perception Token, aiming to empower MLLM with a mechanism to control its visual perception processes. We design two types of Visual Perception Tokens, termed the Region Selection Token and the Vision Re-Encoding Token. MLLMs autonomously generate these tokens, just as they generate text, and use them to trigger additional visual perception actions. The Region Selection Token explicitly identifies specific regions in an image that require further perception, while the Vision Re-Encoding Token uses its hidden states as control signals to guide additional visual perception processes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of these tokens in handling spatial reasoning, improving fine-grained understanding, and other tasks. On average, the introduction of Visual Perception Tokens improves the performance of a 2B model by 23.6\%, increasing its score from 0.572 to 0.708, and even outperforms a 7B parameter model by 13.4\% (from 0.624).

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17429">CLIMB-3D: Continual Learning for Imbalanced 3D Instance Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishal Thengane, Jean Lahoud, Hisham Cholakkal, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Lu Yin, Xiatian Zhu, Salman Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: While 3D instance segmentation has made significant progress, current methods struggle to address realistic scenarios where new categories emerge over time with natural class imbalance. This limitation stems from existing datasets, which typically feature few well-balanced classes. Although few datasets include unbalanced class annotations, they lack the diverse incremental scenarios necessary for evaluating methods under incremental settings. Addressing these challenges requires frameworks that handle both incremental learning and class imbalance. However, existing methods for 3D incremental segmentation rely heavily on large exemplar replay, focusing only on incremental learning while neglecting class imbalance. Moreover, frequency-based tuning for balanced learning is impractical in these setups due to the lack of prior class statistics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework to tackle both \textbf{C}ontinual \textbf{L}earning and class \textbf{Imb}alance for \textbf{3D} instance segmentation (\textbf{CLIMB-3D}). Our proposed approach combines Exemplar Replay (ER), Knowledge Distillation (KD), and a novel Imbalance Correction (IC) module. Unlike prior methods, our framework minimizes ER usage, with KD preventing forgetting and supporting the IC module in compiling past class statistics to balance learning of rare classes during incremental updates. To evaluate our framework, we design three incremental scenarios based on class frequency, semantic similarity, and random grouping that aim to mirror real-world dynamics in 3D environments. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an increase of up to 16.76\% in mAP compared to the baseline.

<p>Abstract: Color constancy methods often struggle to generalize across different camera sensors due to varying spectral sensitivities. We present GCC, which leverages diffusion models to inpaint color checkers into images for illumination estimation. Our key innovations include (1) a single-step deterministic inference approach that inpaints color checkers reflecting scene illumination, (2) a Laplacian decomposition technique that preserves checker structure while allowing illumination-dependent color adaptation, and (3) a mask-based data augmentation strategy for handling imprecise color checker annotations. GCC demonstrates superior robustness in cross-camera scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art worst-25% error rates of 5.15{\deg} and 4.32{\deg} in bi-directional evaluations. These results highlight our method's stability and generalization capability across different camera characteristics without requiring sensor-specific training, making it a versatile solution for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangyu Wu, Siqi Song, Xianglin Qiu, Xiaowei Huang, Fei Ma, Jimin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to predict future user interactions based on historical interactions across multiple domains. The key challenge in CDSR is effectively capturing cross-domain user preferences by fully leveraging both intra-sequence and inter-sequence item interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Image Fusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (IFCDSR), which incorporates item image information to better capture visual preferences. Our approach integrates a frozen CLIP model to generate image embeddings, enriching original item embeddings with visual data from both intra-sequence and inter-sequence interactions. Additionally, we employ a multiple attention layer to capture cross-domain interests, enabling joint learning of single-domain and cross-domain user preferences. To validate the effectiveness of IFCDSR, we re-partitioned four e-commerce datasets and conducted extensive experiments. Results demonstrate that IFCDSR significantly outperforms existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in embedded systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enhanced the capabilities of Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) in computer vision. However, the integration of AI techniques o-nboard drones is constrained by their processing capabilities. In this sense, this study evaluates the deployment of object detection models (YOLOv8n and YOLOv8s) on both resource-constrained edge devices and cloud environments. The objective is to carry out a comparative performance analysis using a representative real-time UAV image processing pipeline. Specifically, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, Orin NX, and Raspberry Pi 5 (RPI5) devices have been tested to measure their detection accuracy, inference speed, and energy consumption, and the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ). The results show that YOLOv8n surpasses YOLOv8s in its inference speed, achieving 52 FPS on the Jetson Orin NX and 65 fps with INT8 quantization. Conversely, the RPI5 failed to satisfy the real-time processing needs in spite of its suitability for low-energy consumption applications. An analysis of both the cloud-based and edge-based end-to-end processing times showed that increased communication latencies hindered real-time applications, revealing trade-offs between edge (low latency) and cloud processing (quick processing). Overall, these findings contribute to providing recommendations and optimization strategies for the deployment of AI models on UAVs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite regulatory efforts to establish reliable content-rating guidelines for mobile apps, the process of assigning content ratings in the Google Play Store remains self-regulated by the app developers. There is no straightforward method of verifying developer-assigned content ratings manually due to the overwhelming scale or automatically due to the challenging problem of interpreting textual and visual data and correlating them with content ratings. We propose and evaluate a visionlanguage approach to predict the content ratings of mobile game applications and detect content rating violations, using a dataset of metadata of popular Android games. Our method achieves ~6% better relative accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art CLIP-fine-tuned model in a multi-modal setting. Applying our classifier in the wild, we detected more than 70 possible cases of content rating violations, including nine instances with the 'Teacher Approved' badge. Additionally, our findings indicate that 34.5% of the apps identified by our classifier as violating content ratings were removed from the Play Store. In contrast, the removal rate for correctly classified apps was only 27%. This discrepancy highlights the practical effectiveness of our classifier in identifying apps that are likely to be removed based on user complaints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Breast cancer is the leading cause of mortality among women. Inspection of breasts by palpation is the key to early detection. We aim to create a wearable tactile glove that could localize the lump in breasts using deep learning (DL). In this work, we present our flexible fabric-based and soft wearable tactile glove for detecting the lumps within custom-made silicone breast prototypes (SBPs). SBPs are made of soft silicone that imitates the human skin and the inner part of the breast. Ball-shaped silicone tumors of 1.5-, 1.75- and 2.0-cm diameters are embedded inside to create another set with lumps. Our approach is based on the InceptionTime DL architecture with transfer learning between experienced and non-experienced users. We collected a dataset from 10 naive participants and one oncologist-mammologist palpating SBPs. We demonstrated that the DL model can classify lump presence, size and location with an accuracy of 82.22%, 67.08% and 62.63%, respectively. In addition, we showed that the model adapted to unseen experienced users with an accuracy of 95.01%, 88.54% and 82.98% for lump presence, size and location classification, respectively. This technology can assist inexperienced users or healthcare providers, thus facilitating more frequent routine checks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The crucial field of Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) aims to transform chemical structure photographs into machine-readable formats so that chemical databases may be efficiently stored and queried. Although a number of OCSR technologies have been created, little is known about how well they work in different picture deterioration scenarios. In this work, a new dataset of chemically structured images that have been systematically harmed graphically by compression, noise, distortion, and black overlays is presented. On these subsets, publicly accessible OCSR tools were thoroughly tested to determine how resilient they were to unfavorable circumstances. The outcomes show notable performance variation, underscoring each tool's advantages and disadvantages. Interestingly, MolScribe performed best under heavy compression (55.8% at 99%) and had the highest identification rate on undamaged photos (94.6%). MolVec performed exceptionally well against noise and black overlay (86.8% at 40%), although it declined under extreme distortion (<70%). With recognition rates below 30%, Decimer demonstrated strong sensitivity to noise and black overlay, but Imago had the lowest baseline accuracy (73.6%). The creative assessment of this study offers important new information about how well the OCSR tool performs when images deteriorate, as well as useful standards for tool development in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural network pruning is essential for reducing model complexity to enable deployment on resource constrained hardware. While performance loss of pruned networks is often attributed to the removal of critical parameters, we identify signal collapse a reduction in activation variance across layers as the root cause. Existing one shot pruning methods focus on weight selection strategies and rely on computationally expensive second order approximations. In contrast, we demonstrate that mitigating signal collapse, rather than optimizing weight selection, is key to improving accuracy of pruned networks. We propose REFLOW that addresses signal collapse without updating trainable weights, revealing high quality sparse sub networks within the original parameter space. REFLOW enables magnitude pruning to achieve state of the art performance, restoring ResNeXt101 accuracy from under 4.1% to 78.9% on ImageNet with only 20% of the weights retained, surpassing state of the art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhou, Heng Li, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Xudong Yan, Mario Fritz, Margret Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to curb overconfidence in neural network predictions and enhance generalization. However, previous research shows that LS can force feature representations into excessively tight clusters, eroding intra-class distinctions. More recent findings suggest that LS also induces overconfidence in misclassifications, yet the precise mechanism remained unclear. In this work, we decompose the loss term introduced by LS, revealing two key components: (i) a regularization term that functions only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-enhancement term that emerges under misclassifications. This latter term compels the model to reinforce incorrect predictions with exaggerated certainty, further collapsing the feature space. To address these issues, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which uniformly applies the intended regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit instead of the ground-truth logit. Through feature analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Extensive experiments on image classification and downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS.

<p>Abstract: In the domain of machine learning, the assumption that training and test data share the same distribution is often violated in real-world scenarios, requiring effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. This paper presents a novel OOD detection method that leverages the unique local neuroplasticity property of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons, KANs exhibit local plasticity, allowing them to preserve learned information while adapting to new tasks. Our method compares the activation patterns of a trained KAN against its untrained counterpart to detect OOD samples. We validate our approach on benchmarks from image and medical domains, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art techniques. These results underscore the potential of KANs in enhancing the reliability of machine learning systems in diverse environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Huang, Junjiao Tian, Brisa Maneechotesuwan, Shivang Chopra, Zsolt Kira</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to adapt large foundation models to downstream tasks while preserving their robustness to distribution shifts. Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaying Gong, Ming Cheng, Hongda Shen, Pierre-Yves Vandenbussche, Janet Jenq, Hoda Eldardiry</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing zero-shot product attribute value (aspect) extraction approaches in e-Commerce industry rely on uni-modal or multi-modal models, where the sellers are asked to provide detailed textual inputs (product descriptions) for the products. However, manually providing (typing) the product descriptions is time-consuming and frustrating for the sellers. Thus, we propose a cross-modal zero-shot attribute value generation framework (ViOC-AG) based on CLIP, which only requires product images as the inputs. ViOC-AG follows a text-only training process, where a task-customized text decoder is trained with the frozen CLIP text encoder to alleviate the modality gap and task disconnection. During the zero-shot inference, product aspects are generated by the frozen CLIP image encoder connected with the trained task-customized text decoder. OCR tokens and outputs from a frozen prompt-based LLM correct the decoded outputs for out-of-domain attribute values. Experiments show that ViOC-AG significantly outperforms other fine-tuned vision-language models for zero-shot attribute value extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheling Tan, Kexin Ding, Jin Gao, Mu Zhou, Dimitris Metaxas, Shaoting Zhang, Dequan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundational models (FMs) have made significant strides in the healthcare domain. Yet the data silo challenge and privacy concern remain in healthcare systems, hindering safe medical data sharing and collaborative model development among institutions. The collection and curation of scalable clinical datasets increasingly become the bottleneck for training strong FMs. In this study, we propose Medical Foundation Models Merging (MedForge), a cooperative framework enabling a community-driven medical foundation model development, meanwhile preventing the information leakage of raw patient data and mitigating synchronization model development issues across clinical institutions. MedForge offers a bottom-up model construction mechanism by flexibly merging task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules, which can adapt to downstream tasks while retaining original model parameters. Through an asynchronous LoRA module integration scheme, the resulting composite model can progressively enhance its comprehensive performance on various clinical tasks. MedForge shows strong performance on multiple clinical datasets (e.g., breast cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer) collected from different institutions. Our major findings highlight the value of collaborative foundation models in advancing multi-center clinical collaboration effectively and cohesively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanxuan Wang, Na Lu, Xueying Zhao, Yuxuan Yan, Kaipeng Ma, Kwoh Chee Keong, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from noisy labels (LNL) aims to train high-performance deep models using noisy datasets. Meta learning based label correction methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in LNL by designing various meta label rectification tasks. However, extra clean validation set is a prerequisite for these methods to perform label correction, requiring extra labor and greatly limiting their practicality. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel noisy meta label correction framework STCT, which counterintuitively uses noisy data to correct label noise, borrowing the spirit in the saying ``Set a Thief to Catch a Thief''. The core idea of STCT is to leverage noisy data which is i.i.d. with the training data as a validation set to evaluate model performance and perform label correction in a meta learning framework, eliminating the need for extra clean data. By decoupling the complex bi-level optimization in meta learning into representation learning and label correction, STCT is solved through an alternating training strategy between noisy meta correction and semi-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of STCT, particularly in high noise rate scenarios. STCT achieves 96.9% label correction and 95.2% classification performance on CIFAR-10 with 80% symmetric noise, significantly surpassing the current state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Gao, Zhuolin He, Jian Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: To deploy machine learning models in the real world, researchers have proposed many OOD detection algorithms to help models identify unknown samples during the inference phase and prevent them from making untrustworthy predictions. Unlike methods that rely on extra data for outlier exposure training, post hoc methods detect Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples by developing scoring functions, which are model agnostic and do not require additional training. However, previous post hoc methods may fail to capture the geometric cues embedded in network representations. Thus, in this study, we propose a novel score function based on the optimal transport theory, named OTOD, for OOD detection. We utilize information from features, logits, and the softmax probability space to calculate the OOD score for each test sample. Our experiments show that combining this information can boost the performance of OTOD with a certain margin. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Notably, OTOD outperforms the state-of-the-art method GEN by 7.19% in the mean FPR@95 on the CIFAR-10 benchmark using ResNet-18 as the backbone, and by 12.51% in the mean FPR@95 using WideResNet-28 as the backbone. In addition, we provide theoretical guarantees for OTOD. The code is available in https://github.com/HengGao12/OTOD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computational pathology, integrating computational methods and digital imaging, has shown to be effective in advancing disease diagnosis and prognosis. In recent years, the development of machine learning and deep learning has greatly bolstered the power of computational pathology. However, there still remains the issue of data scarcity and data imbalance, which can have an adversarial effect on any computational method. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and effective data augmentation strategy to generate new pathology images from the existing pathology images and thus enrich datasets without additional data collection or annotation costs. To evaluate the proposed method, we employed two sets of colorectal cancer datasets and obtained improved classification results, suggesting that the proposed simple approach holds the potential for alleviating the data scarcity and imbalance in computational pathology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Du, Chuqin Zhou, Ning Cao, Gang Chen, Yunuo Chen, Zhengxue Cheng, Li Song, Guo Lu, Wenjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have driven significant progress in lossless image compression. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), preliminary attempts have been made to leverage the extensive prior knowledge embedded in these pretrained models to enhance lossless image compression, particularly by improving the entropy model. However, a significant challenge remains in bridging the gap between the textual prior knowledge within LLMs and lossless image compression. To tackle this challenge and unlock the potential of LLMs, this paper introduces a novel paradigm for lossless image compression that incorporates LLMs with visual prompts. Specifically, we first generate a lossy reconstruction of the input image as visual prompts, from which we extract features to serve as visual embeddings for the LLM. The residual between the original image and the lossy reconstruction is then fed into the LLM along with these visual embeddings, enabling the LLM to function as an entropy model to predict the probability distribution of the residual. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art compression performance, surpassing both traditional and learning-based lossless image codecs. Furthermore, our approach can be easily extended to images from other domains, such as medical and screen content images, achieving impressive performance. These results highlight the potential of LLMs for lossless image compression and may inspire further research in related directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Jiao, Mei Yang, Mo Weng</p>
<p>Abstract: In spite of being a valuable tool to simultaneously visualize multiple types of subcellular structures using spectrally distinct fluorescent labels, a standard fluoresce microscope is only able to identify a few microscopic objects; such a limit is largely imposed by the number of fluorescent labels available to the sample. In order to simultaneously visualize more objects, in this paper, we propose to use video-to-video translation that mimics the development process of microscopic objects. In essence, we use a microscopy video-to-video translation framework namely Spatial-temporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) to reveal the spatial and temporal relationships between the microscopic objects, after which a microscopy video of one object can be translated to another object in a different domain. The experimental results confirm that the proposed STGAN is effective in microscopy video-to-video translation that mitigates the spectral conflicts caused by the limited fluorescent labels, allowing multiple microscopic objects be simultaneously visualized.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce an efficient approach for learning dexterous grasping with minimal data, advancing robotic manipulation capabilities across different robotic hands. Unlike traditional methods that require millions of grasp labels for each robotic hand, our method achieves high performance with human-level learning efficiency: only hundreds of grasp attempts on 40 training objects. The approach separates the grasping process into two stages: first, a universal model maps scene geometry to intermediate contact-centric grasp representations, independent of specific robotic hands. Next, a unique grasp decision model is trained for each robotic hand through real-world trial and error, translating these representations into final grasp poses. Our results show a grasp success rate of 75-95\% across three different robotic hands in real-world cluttered environments with over 150 novel objects, improving to 80-98\% with increased training objects. This adaptable method demonstrates promising applications for humanoid robots, prosthetics, and other domains requiring robust, versatile robotic manipulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models for image generation are now commonly used for a wide variety of applications, ranging from guided image generation for entertainment to solving inverse problems. Nonetheless, training a generator is a non-trivial feat that requires fine-tuning and can lead to so-called hallucinations, that is, the generation of images that are unrealistic. In this work, we explore image generation using flow matching. We explain and demonstrate why flow matching can generate hallucinations, and propose an iterative process to improve the generation process. Our iterative process can be integrated into virtually $\textit{any}$ generative modeling technique, thereby enhancing the performance and robustness of image synthesis systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitong Lu, Yuxin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Category-selective regions in the human brain, such as the fusiform face area (FFA), extrastriate body area (EBA), parahippocampal place area (PPA), and visual word form area (VWFA), play a crucial role in high-level visual processing. Here, we investigate whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) exhibit similar category-selective neurons and how these neurons vary across model layers and between purely visual and vision-language models. Inspired by fMRI functional localizer experiments, we presented images from different categories (faces, bodies, scenes, words, scrambled scenes, and scrambled words) to deep networks and identified category-selective neurons using statistical criteria. Comparing ResNet and the structurally controlled ResNet-based CLIP model, we found that both models contain category-selective neurons, with their proportion increasing across layers, mirroring category selectivity in higher-level visual brain regions. However, CLIP exhibited a higher proportion but lower specificity of category-selective neurons compared to ResNet. Additionally, CLIP's category-selective neurons were more evenly distributed across feature maps and demonstrated greater representational consistency across layers. These findings suggest that language learning increases the number of category-selective neurons while reducing their selectivity strength, reshaping visual representations in deep networks. Our study provides insights into how ANNs mirror biological vision and how multimodal learning influences category-selective representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devanish N. Kamtam, Joseph B. Shrager, Satya Deepya Malla, Nicole Lin, Juan J. Cardona, Jake J. Kim, Clarence Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Introduction: Computer vision (CV) has had a transformative impact in biomedical fields such as radiology, dermatology, and pathology. Its real-world adoption in surgical applications, however, remains limited. We review the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning (DL)-based CV models for segmentation and object detection of anatomical structures in videos obtained during surgical procedures.
  Methods: We conducted a scoping review of studies on semantic segmentation and object detection of anatomical structures published between 2014 and 2024 from 3 major databases - PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore. The primary objective was to evaluate the state-of-the-art performance of semantic segmentation in surgical videos. Secondary objectives included examining DL models, progress toward clinical applications, and the specific challenges with segmentation of organs/tissues in surgical videos.
  Results: We identified 58 relevant published studies. These focused predominantly on procedures from general surgery [20(34.4%)], colorectal surgery [9(15.5%)], and neurosurgery [8(13.8%)]. Cholecystectomy [14(24.1%)] and low anterior rectal resection [5(8.6%)] were the most common procedures addressed. Semantic segmentation [47(81%)] was the primary CV task. U-Net [14(24.1%)] and DeepLab [13(22.4%)] were the most widely used models. Larger organs such as the liver (Dice score: 0.88) had higher accuracy compared to smaller structures such as nerves (Dice score: 0.49). Models demonstrated real-time inference potential ranging from 5-298 frames-per-second (fps).
  Conclusion: This review highlights the significant progress made in DL-based semantic segmentation for surgical videos with real-time applicability, particularly for larger organs. Addressing challenges with smaller structures, data availability, and generalizability remains crucial for future advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prafful Kumar Khoba, Zijian Wang, Chetan Arora, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging a transferability estimation metric facilitates the non-trivial challenge of selecting the optimal model for the downstream task from a pool of pre-trained models. Most existing metrics primarily focus on identifying the statistical relationship between feature embeddings and the corresponding labels within the target dataset, but overlook crucial aspect of model robustness. This oversight may limit their effectiveness in accurately ranking pre-trained models. To address this limitation, we introduce a feature perturbation method that enhances the transferability estimation process by systematically altering the feature space. Our method includes a Spread operation that increases intra-class variability, adding complexity within classes, and an Attract operation that minimizes the distances between different classes, thereby blurring the class boundaries. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our feature perturbation method in providing a more precise and robust estimation of model transferability. Notably, the existing LogMe method exhibited a significant improvement, showing a 28.84% increase in performance after applying our feature perturbation method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Gong, Yekun Ke, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The expressive power and computational complexity of deep visual generative models, such as flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models, have gained considerable interest for their wide-ranging applications in generative tasks. However, the theoretical characterization of their expressiveness through the lens of circuit complexity remains underexplored, particularly for the state-of-the-art architecture like FlowAR proposed by [Ren et al., 2024], which integrates flow-based and autoregressive mechanisms. This gap limits our understanding of their inherent computational limits and practical efficiency. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing the circuit complexity of the FlowAR architecture. We demonstrate that when the largest feature map produced by the FlowAR model has dimensions $n \times n \times c$, the FlowAR model is simulable by a family of threshold circuits $\mathsf{TC}^0$, which have constant depth $O(1)$ and polynomial width $\mathrm{poly}(n)$. This is the first study to rigorously highlight the limitations in the expressive power of FlowAR models. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which the FlowAR model computations can achieve almost quadratic time. To validate our theoretical findings, we present efficient model variant constructions based on low-rank approximations that align with the derived criteria. Our work provides a foundation for future comparisons with other generative paradigms and guides the development of more efficient and expressive implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingguag Hao, Kuangrong Hao, Bing Wei, Xue-song Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current federated backdoor attacks focus on collaboratively training backdoor triggers, where multiple compromised clients train their local trigger patches and then merge them into a global trigger during the inference phase. However, these methods require careful design of the shape and position of trigger patches and lack the feature interactions between trigger patches during training, resulting in poor backdoor attack success rates. Moreover, the pixels of the patches remain untruncated, thereby making abrupt areas in backdoor examples easily detectable by the detection algorithm. To this end, we propose a novel benchmark for the federated backdoor attack based on feature aggregation. Specifically, we align the dimensions of triggers with images, delimit the trigger's pixel boundaries, and facilitate feature interaction among local triggers trained by each compromised client. Furthermore, leveraging the intra-class attack strategy, we propose the simultaneous generation of backdoor triggers for all target classes, significantly reducing the overall production time for triggers across all target classes and increasing the risk of the federated model being attacked. Experiments demonstrate that our method can not only bypass the detection of defense methods while patch-based methods fail, but also achieve a zero-shot backdoor attack with a success rate of 77.39%. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to implement such a zero-shot attack in federated learning. Finally, we evaluate attack performance by varying the trigger's training factors, including poison location, ratio, pixel bound, and trigger training duration (local epochs and communication rounds).</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomously controlling the position of Remotely Operated underwater Vehicles (ROVs) is of crucial importance for a wide range of underwater engineering applications, such as in the inspection and maintenance of underwater industrial structures. Consequently, studying vision-based underwater robot navigation and control has recently gained increasing attention to counter the numerous challenges faced in underwater conditions, such as lighting variability, turbidity, camera image distortions (due to bubbles), and ROV positional disturbances (due to underwater currents). In this paper, we propose (to the best of our knowledge) a first rigorous unified benchmarking of more than seven Machine Learning (ML)-based one-shot object tracking algorithms for vision-based position locking of ROV platforms. We propose a position-locking system that processes images of an object of interest in front of which the ROV must be kept stable. Then, our proposed system uses the output result of different object tracking algorithms to automatically correct the position of the ROV against external disturbances. We conducted numerous real-world experiments using a BlueROV2 platform within an indoor pool and provided clear demonstrations of the strengths and weaknesses of each tracking approach. Finally, to help alleviate the scarcity of underwater ROV data, we release our acquired data base as open-source with the hope of benefiting future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything technologies (V2X) have become an ideal paradigm to extend the perception range and see through the occlusion. Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monocular visual inertial odometry (VIO) has facilitated a wide range of real-time motion tracking applications, thanks to the small size of the sensor suite and low power consumption. To successfully bootstrap VIO algorithms, the initialization module is extremely important. Most initialization methods rely on the reconstruction of 3D visual point clouds. These methods suffer from high computational cost as state vector contains both motion states and 3D feature points. To address this issue, some researchers recently proposed a structureless initialization method, which can solve the initial state without recovering 3D structure. However, this method potentially compromises performance due to the decoupled estimation of rotation and translation, as well as linear constraints. To improve its accuracy, we propose novel structureless visual-inertial bundle adjustment to further refine previous structureless solution. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show our method significantly improves the VIO initialization accuracy, while maintaining real-time performance.</p>

Chest x-rays (CXRs) are used for diagnosis of COVID-19, but few studies predict the severity of a patient's condition from CXRs. In this study, we produce a large COVID severity dataset by merging three sources and investigate the efficacy of transfer learning using ImageNet- and CXR-pretrained models and vision transformers (ViTs) in both severity regression and classification tasks. A pretrained DenseNet161 model performed the best on the three class severity prediction problem, reaching 80% accuracy overall and 77.3%, 83.9%, and 70% on mild, moderate and severe cases, respectively. The ViT had the best regression results, with a mean absolute error of 0.5676 compared to radiologist-predicted severity scores. The project's source code is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin Wu, Quanyu Long, Jing Li, Jianfei Yu, Wenya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular approach for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing their limitations in verifying facts and answering knowledge-intensive questions. As the research in LLM extends their capability to handle input modality other than text, e.g. image, several multimodal RAG benchmarks are proposed. Nonetheless, they mainly use textual knowledge bases as the primary source of evidences for augmentation. There still lack benchmarks designed to evaluate images as augmentation in RAG systems and how they leverage visual knowledge. We propose Visual-RAG, a novel Question Answering benchmark that emphasizes visual knowledge intensive questions. Unlike prior works relying on text-based evidence, Visual-RAG necessitates text-to-image retrieval and integration of relevant clue images to extract visual knowledge as evidence. With Visual-RAG, we evaluate 5 open-sourced and 3 proprietary Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), revealing that images can serve as good evidence in RAG; however, even the SoTA models struggle with effectively extracting and utilizing visual knowledge</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyi Qu, David Aponte, Colby Banbury, Daniel P. Robinson, Tianyu Ding, Kazuhito Koishida, Ilya Zharkov, Tianyi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured pruning and quantization are fundamental techniques used to reduce the size of deep neural networks (DNNs) and typically are applied independently. Applying these techniques jointly via co-optimization has the potential to produce smaller, high-quality models. However, existing joint schemes are not widely used because of (1) engineering difficulties (complicated multi-stage processes), (2) black-box optimization (extensive hyperparameter tuning to control the overall compression), and (3) insufficient architecture generalization. To address these limitations, we present the framework GETA, which automatically and efficiently performs joint structured pruning and quantization-aware training on any DNNs. GETA introduces three key innovations: (i) a quantization-aware dependency graph (QADG) that constructs a pruning search space for generic quantization-aware DNN, (ii) a partially projected stochastic gradient method that guarantees layerwise bit constraints are satisfied, and (iii) a new joint learning strategy that incorporates interpretable relationships between pruning and quantization. We present numerical experiments on both convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures that show that our approach achieves competitive (often superior) performance compared to existing joint pruning and quantization methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengzhi Li, Megan Tjandrasuwita, Yi R. Fung, Armando Solar-Lezama, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Socially intelligent AI that can understand and interact seamlessly with humans in daily lives is increasingly important as AI becomes more closely integrated with peoples' daily activities. However, current works in artificial social reasoning all rely on language-only, or language-dominant approaches to benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To address this limitation, we tap into a novel source of data rich in nonverbal and social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique challenges and opportunities in interpreting non-verbal social communication. We contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 221 videos from YouTube, through rigorous annotation and verification, resulting in a benchmark with 101 videos and 806 question-answer pairs. Using MimeQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that their overall accuracy ranges from 15-30%. Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. Our data resources are released at https://github.com/MIT-MI/MimeQA to inspire future work in foundation models that embody true social intelligence capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yehong Huang, Chen Zhao, Rochak Dhakal, Min Zhao, Guang-Uei Hung, Zhixin Jiang, Weihua Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Background and Purpose: Functional assessment of the left ventricle using gated myocardial perfusion (MPS) single-photon emission computed tomography relies on the precise extraction of the left ventricular contours while simultaneously ensuring the security of patient data. Methods: In this paper, we introduce the integration of Federated Domain Adaptation with TimeSformer, named 'FedDA-TSformer' for left ventricle segmentation using MPS. FedDA-TSformer captures spatial and temporal features in gated MPS images, leveraging spatial attention, temporal attention, and federated learning for improved domain adaptation while ensuring patient data security. In detail, we employed Divide-Space-Time-Attention mechanism to extract spatio-temporal correlations from the multi-centered MPS datasets, ensuring that predictions are spatio-temporally consistent. To achieve domain adaptation, we align the model output on MPS from three different centers using local maximum mean discrepancy (LMMD) loss. This approach effectively addresses the dual requirements of federated learning and domain adaptation, enhancing the model's performance during training with multi-site datasets while ensuring the protection of data from different hospitals. Results: Our FedDA-TSformer was trained and evaluated using MPS datasets collected from three hospitals, comprising a total of 150 subjects. Each subject's cardiac cycle was divided into eight gates. The model achieved Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 0.842 and 0.907 for left ventricular (LV) endocardium and epicardium segmentation, respectively. Conclusion: Our proposed FedDA-TSformer model addresses the challenge of multi-center generalization, ensures patient data privacy protection, and demonstrates effectiveness in left ventricular (LV) segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongzhe Cheng, Tianyou Zheng, Tianyi Zhang, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Weiming Zhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-Distribution(OOD) detection, a fundamental machine learning task aimed at identifying abnormal samples, traditionally requires model retraining for different inlier distributions. While recent research demonstrates the applicability of diffusion models to OOD detection, existing approaches are limited to Euclidean or latent image spaces. Our work extends OOD detection to trajectories in the Special Euclidean Group in 3D ($\mathbb{SE}(3)$), addressing a critical need in computer vision, robotics, and engineering applications that process object pose sequences in $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. We present $\textbf{D}$iffusion-based $\textbf{O}$ut-of-distribution detection on $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ ($\mathbf{DOSE3}$), a novel OOD framework that extends diffusion to a unified sample space of $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ pose sequences. Through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate $\mathbf{DOSE3}$'s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art OOD detection frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianli Tao, Ziyang Wang, Han Zhang, Theodoros N. Arvanitis, Le Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain tumors delay the standard preprocessing workflow for further examination. Brain inpainting offers a viable, although difficult, solution for tumor tissue processing, which is necessary to improve the precision of the diagnosis and treatment. Most conventional U-Net-based generative models, however, often face challenges in capturing the complex, nonlinear latent representations inherent in brain imaging. In order to accomplish high-quality healthy brain tissue reconstruction, this work proposes DiffKAN-Inpainting, an innovative method that blends diffusion models with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks architecture. During the denoising process, we introduce the RePaint method and tumor information to generate images with a higher fidelity and smoother margin. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed DiffKAN-Inpainting inpaints more detailed and realistic reconstructions on the BraTS dataset. The knowledge gained from ablation study provide insights for future research to balance performance with computing cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahsa Golchoubian, Moojan Ghafurian, Nasser Lashgarian Azad, Kerstin Dautenhahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory behaviours of pedestrians and vehicles operating close to each other can be different in unstructured compared to structured environments. These differences in the motion behaviour are valuable to be considered in the trajectory prediction algorithm of an autonomous vehicle. However, the available datasets on pedestrians' and vehicles' trajectories that are commonly used as benchmarks for trajectory prediction have not been classified based on the nature of their environment. On the other hand, the definitions provided for unstructured and structured environments are rather qualitative and hard to be used for justifying the type of a given environment. In this paper, we have compared different existing datasets based on a couple of extracted trajectory features, such as mean speed and trajectory variability. Through K-means clustering and generalized linear models, we propose more quantitative measures for distinguishing the two different types of environments. Our results show that features such as trajectory variability, stop fraction and density of pedestrians are different among the two environmental types and can be used to classify the existing datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> An-Lan Wang, Nuo Chen, Kun-Yu Lin, Li Yuan-Ming, Wei-Shi Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In general, humans would grasp an object differently for different tasks, e.g., "grasping the handle of a knife to cut" vs. "grasping the blade to hand over". In the field of robotic grasp pose detection research, some existing works consider this task-oriented grasping and made some progress, but they are generally constrained by low-DoF gripper type or non-cluttered setting, which is not applicable for human assistance in real life. With an aim to get more general and practical grasp models, in this paper, we investigate the problem named Task-Oriented 6-DoF Grasp Pose Detection in Clutters (TO6DGC), which extends the task-oriented problem to a more general 6-DOF Grasp Pose Detection in Cluttered (multi-object) scenario. To this end, we construct a large-scale 6-DoF task-oriented grasping dataset, 6-DoF Task Grasp (6DTG), which features 4391 cluttered scenes with over 2 million 6-DoF grasp poses. Each grasp is annotated with a specific task, involving 6 tasks and 198 objects in total. Moreover, we propose One-Stage TaskGrasp (OSTG), a strong baseline to address the TO6DGC problem. Our OSTG adopts a task-oriented point selection strategy to detect where to grasp, and a task-oriented grasp generation module to decide how to grasp given a specific task. To evaluate the effectiveness of OSTG, extensive experiments are conducted on 6DTG. The results show that our method outperforms various baselines on multiple metrics. Real robot experiments also verify that our OSTG has a better perception of the task-oriented grasp points and 6-DoF grasp poses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyuan Wu, Zheng Liu, Yong Chen, Chao Su, Dezhong Peng, Xu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of deep neural networks has brought increased attention to the security and robustness of these models. While existing adversarial attack algorithms have demonstrated success in improving adversarial transferability, their performance remains suboptimal due to a lack of consideration for the discrepancies between target and source models. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method, Inverse Knowledge Distillation (IKD), designed to enhance adversarial transferability effectively. IKD introduces a distillation-inspired loss function that seamlessly integrates with gradient-based attack methods, promoting diversity in attack gradients and mitigating overfitting to specific model architectures. By diversifying gradients, IKD enables the generation of adversarial samples with superior generalization capabilities across different models, significantly enhancing their effectiveness in black-box attack scenarios. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating substantial improvements in the transferability and attack success rates of adversarial samples across a wide range of models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maksim Zhdanov, Max Welling, Jan-Willem van de Meent</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale physical systems defined on irregular grids pose significant scalability challenges for deep learning methods, especially in the presence of long-range interactions and multi-scale coupling. Traditional approaches that compute all pairwise interactions, such as attention, become computationally prohibitive as they scale quadratically with the number of nodes. We present Erwin, a hierarchical transformer inspired by methods from computational many-body physics, which combines the efficiency of tree-based algorithms with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Erwin employs ball tree partitioning to organize computation, which enables linear-time attention by processing nodes in parallel within local neighborhoods of fixed size. Through progressive coarsening and refinement of the ball tree structure, complemented by a novel cross-ball interaction mechanism, it captures both fine-grained local details and global features. We demonstrate Erwin's effectiveness across multiple domains, including cosmology, molecular dynamics, and particle fluid dynamics, where it consistently outperforms baseline methods both in accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boris Shirokikh, Anvar Kurmukov, Mariia Donskova, Valentin Samokhin, Mikhail Belyaev, Ivan Oseledets</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain shift presents a significant challenge in applying Deep Learning to the segmentation of 3D medical images from sources like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). Although numerous Domain Adaptation methods have been developed to address this issue, they are often evaluated under impractical data shift scenarios. Specifically, the medical imaging datasets used are often either private, too small for robust training and evaluation, or limited to single or synthetic tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a M3DA /"mEd@/ benchmark comprising four publicly available, multiclass segmentation datasets. We have designed eight domain pairs featuring diverse and practically relevant distribution shifts. These include inter-modality shifts between MRI and CT and intra-modality shifts among various MRI acquisition parameters, different CT radiation doses, and presence/absence of contrast enhancement in images. Within the proposed benchmark, we evaluate more than ten existing domain adaptation methods. Our results show that none of them can consistently close the performance gap between the domains. For instance, the most effective method reduces the performance gap by about 62% across the tasks. This highlights the need for developing novel domain adaptation algorithms to enhance the robustness and scalability of deep learning models in medical imaging. We made our M3DA benchmark publicly available: https://github.com/BorisShirokikh/M3DA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junseo Lee, Jaisung Kim, Junyong Park, Jaewoong Sim</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphics rendering that builds on machine learning and radiance fields is gaining significant attention due to its outstanding quality and speed in generating photorealistic images from novel viewpoints. However, prior work has primarily focused on evaluating its performance through software-based rendering on programmable shader cores, leaving its performance when exploiting fixed-function graphics units largely unexplored.
  In this paper, we investigate the performance implications of performing radiance field rendering on the hardware graphics pipeline. In doing so, we implement the state-of-the-art radiance field method, 3D Gaussian splatting, using graphics APIs and evaluate it across synthetic and real-world scenes on today's graphics hardware. Based on our analysis, we present VR-Pipe, which seamlessly integrates two innovations into graphics hardware to streamline the hardware pipeline for volume rendering, such as radiance field methods. First, we introduce native hardware support for early termination by repurposing existing special-purpose hardware in modern GPUs. Second, we propose multi-granular tile binning with quad merging, which opportunistically blends fragments in shader cores before passing them to fixed-function blending units. Our evaluation shows that VR-Pipe greatly improves rendering performance, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup over the conventional graphics pipeline with negligible hardware overhead.</p>

To address this problem, we present Imprinto, an infrared inkjet watermarking technique that allows for invisible content embeddings only by using off-the-shelf IR inks and a camera. Imprinto was established through a psychophysical experiment, studying how much IR ink can be used while remaining invisible to users regardless of background color. We demonstrate that we can detect invisible IR content through our machine learning pipeline, and we developed an authoring tool that optimizes the amount of IR ink on the color regions of an input document for machine and human detectability.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved significant success in generative tasks. However, their training and sampling processes suffer from the issue of distribution mismatch. During the denoising process, the input data distributions differ between the training and inference stages, potentially leading to inaccurate data generation. To obviate this, we analyze the training objective of DPMs and theoretically demonstrate that this mismatch can be alleviated through Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), which is equivalent to performing robustness-driven Adversarial Training (AT) on DPMs. Furthermore, for the recently proposed Consistency Model (CM), which distills the inference process of the DPM, we prove that its training objective also encounters the mismatch issue. Fortunately, this issue can be mitigated by AT as well. Based on these insights, we propose to conduct efficient AT on both DPM and CM. Finally, extensive empirical studies validate the effectiveness of AT in diffusion-based models. The code is available at https://github.com/kugwzk/AT_Diff.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utsav Akhaury, Pascale Jablonka, Fr\'ed\'eric Courbin, Jean-Luc Starck</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of surveys like $Euclid$ and $Vera$ $C.$ $Rubin$, astrophysicists will have access to both deep, high-resolution images, and multi-band images. However, these two conditions are not simultaneously available in any single dataset. It is therefore vital to devise image deconvolution algorithms that exploit the best of the two worlds and that can jointly analyze datasets spanning a range of resolutions and wavelengths. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-band deconvolution technique aimed at improving the resolution of ground-based astronomical images by leveraging higher-resolution space-based observations. The method capitalizes on the fortunate fact that the $Vera$ $C.$ $Rubin$ $r$-, $i$-, and $z$-bands lie within the $Euclid$ $VIS$ band. The algorithm jointly deconvolves all the data to turn the $r$-, $i$-, and $z$-band $Vera$ $C.$ $Rubin$ images to the resolution of $Euclid$ by enabling us to leverage the correlations between the different bands. We also investigate the performance of deep learning-based denoising with DRUNet to further improve the results. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of resolution and morphology recovery, flux preservation, and generalization to different noise levels. This approach extends beyond the specific $Euclid$-$Rubin$ combination, offering a versatile solution to improve the resolution of ground-based images in multiple photometric bands by jointly using any space-based images with overlapping filters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Eichhorn, Veronika Spieker, Kerstin Hammernik, Elisa Saks, Lina Felsner, Kilian Weiss, Christine Preibisch, Julia A. Schnabel</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: T2* quantification from gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging is particularly affected by subject motion due to the high sensitivity to magnetic field inhomogeneities, which are influenced by motion and might cause signal loss. Thus, motion correction is crucial to obtain high-quality T2* maps.
  Methods: We extend our previously introduced learning-based physics-informed motion correction method, PHIMO, by utilizing acquisition knowledge to enhance the reconstruction performance for challenging motion patterns and increase PHIMO's robustness to varying strengths of magnetic field inhomogeneities across the brain. We perform comprehensive evaluations regarding motion detection accuracy and image quality for data with simulated and real motion.
  Results: Our extended version of PHIMO outperforms the learning-based baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to line detection and image quality. Moreover, PHIMO performs on-par with a conventional state-of-the-art motion correction method for T2* quantification from gradient echo MRI, which relies on redundant data acquisition.
  Conclusion: PHIMO's competitive motion correction performance, combined with a reduction in acquisition time by over 40% compared to the state-of-the-art method, make it a promising solution for motion-robust T2* quantification in research settings and clinical routine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xander Haijen, Bikram Koirala, Xuanwen Tao, Paul Scheunders</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral unmixing is an important task in the research field of hyperspectral image processing. It can be thought of as a regression problem, where the observed variable (i.e., an image pixel) is to be found as a function of the response variables (i.e., the pure materials in a scene, called endmembers). The Linear Mixing Model (LMM) has received a great deal of attention, due to its simplicity and ease of use in, e.g., optimization problems. Its biggest flaw is that it assumes that any pure material can be characterized by one unique spectrum throughout the entire scene. In many cases this is incorrect: the endmembers face a significant amount of spectral variability caused by, e.g., illumination conditions, atmospheric effects, or intrinsic variability. Researchers have suggested several generalizations of the LMM to mitigate this effect. However, most models lead to ill-posed and highly non-convex optimization problems, which are hard to solve and have hyperparameters that are difficult to tune. In this paper, we propose a two-step LMM that bridges the gap between model complexity and computational tractability. We show that this model leads to only a mildly non-convex optimization problem, which we solve with an interior-point solver. This method requires virtually no hyperparameter tuning, and can therefore be used easily and quickly in a wide range of unmixing tasks. We show that the model is competitive and in some cases superior to existing and well-established unmixing methods and algorithms. We do this through several experiments on synthetic data, real-life satellite data, and hybrid synthetic-real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hogun Kee, Wooseok Oh, Minjae Kang, Hyemin Ahn, Songhwai Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present the tidiness score-guided Monte Carlo tree search (TSMCTS), a novel framework designed to address the tabletop tidying up problem using only an RGB-D camera. We address two major problems for tabletop tidying up problem: (1) the lack of public datasets and benchmarks, and (2) the difficulty of specifying the goal configuration of unseen objects. We address the former by presenting the tabletop tidying up (TTU) dataset, a structured dataset collected in simulation. Using this dataset, we train a vision-based discriminator capable of predicting the tidiness score. This discriminator can consistently evaluate the degree of tidiness across unseen configurations, including real-world scenes. Addressing the second problem, we employ Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to find tidying trajectories without specifying explicit goals. Instead of providing specific goals, we demonstrate that our MCTS-based planner can find diverse tidied configurations using the tidiness score as a guidance. Consequently, we propose TSMCTS, which integrates a tidiness discriminator with an MCTS-based tidying planner to find optimal tidied arrangements. TSMCTS has successfully demonstrated its capability across various environments, including coffee tables, dining tables, office desks, and bathrooms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Lu, Yuetao Li, Zhizhou Jia, Qun Hao, Shaohui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this letter, we propose a color-assisted robust framework for accurate LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM). Simultaneously receiving data from both the LiDAR and the camera, the framework utilizes the color information from the camera images to colorize the LiDAR point clouds and then performs iterative pose optimization. For each LiDAR scan, the edge and planar features are extracted and colored using the corresponding image and then matched to a global map. Specifically, we adopt a perceptually uniform color difference weighting strategy to exclude color correspondence outliers and a robust error metric based on the Welsch's function to mitigate the impact of positional correspondence outliers during the pose optimization process. As a result, the system achieves accurate localization and reconstructs dense, accurate, colored and three-dimensional (3D) maps of the environment. Thorough experiments with challenging scenarios, including complex forests and a campus, show that our method provides higher robustness and accuracy compared with current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Vasile, Elisa Maiettini, Giulia Pasquale, Nicol\`o Boccardo, Lorenzo Natale</p>
<p>Abstract: Most control techniques for prosthetic grasping focus on dexterous fingers control, but overlook the wrist motion. This forces the user to perform compensatory movements with the elbow, shoulder and hip to adapt the wrist for grasping. We propose a computer vision-based system that leverages the collaboration between the user and an automatic system in a shared autonomy framework, to perform continuous control of the wrist degrees of freedom in a prosthetic arm, promoting a more natural approach-to-grasp motion. Our pipeline allows to seamlessly control the prosthetic wrist to follow the target object and finally orient it for grasping according to the user intent. We assess the effectiveness of each system component through quantitative analysis and finally deploy our method on the Hannes prosthetic arm.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumen Sinha, Tanisha Rana, Rahul Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel approach for plant hierarchical taxonomy classification by posing the problem as an open class problem. It is observed that existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform hierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification. Thus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it best hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates DenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for hierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal plants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed and precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model captures both local and global contextual information from the images, improving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new ones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple scales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical classification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and unknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and without background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word application. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species the model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for predicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively. Our proposed model size is almost four times less than the existing state of the art methods making it easily deploy able in real world application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Inbar Gat, Sigal Raab, Guy Tevet, Yuval Reshef, Amit H. Bermano, Daniel Cohen-Or</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating motion for arbitrary skeletons is a longstanding challenge in computer graphics, remaining largely unexplored due to the scarcity of diverse datasets and the irregular nature of the data. In this work, we introduce AnyTop, a diffusion model that generates motions for diverse characters with distinct motion dynamics, using only their skeletal structure as input. Our work features a transformer-based denoising network, tailored for arbitrary skeleton learning, integrating topology information into the traditional attention mechanism. Additionally, by incorporating textual joint descriptions into the latent feature representation, AnyTop learns semantic correspondences between joints across diverse skeletons. Our evaluation demonstrates that AnyTop generalizes well, even with as few as three training examples per topology, and can produce motions for unseen skeletons as well. Furthermore, our model's latent space is highly informative, enabling downstream tasks such as joint correspondence, temporal segmentation and motion editing.

<p>Abstract: Despite the potential of synthetic medical data for augmenting and improving the generalizability of deep learning models, memorization in generative models can lead to unintended leakage of sensitive patient information and limit model utility. Thus, the use of memorizing generative models in the medical domain can jeopardize patient privacy. We propose a framework for identifying replicas, i.e. nearly identical copies of the training data, in synthetic medical image datasets. Our REpLIca deteCTion (RELICT) framework for medical image generative models evaluates image similarity using three complementary approaches: (1) voxel-level analysis, (2) feature-level analysis by a pretrained medical foundation model, and (3) segmentation-level analysis. Two clinically relevant 3D generative modelling use cases were investigated: non-contrast head CT with intracerebral hemorrhage (N=774) and time-of-flight MR angiography of the Circle of Willis (N=1,782). Expert visual scoring was used as the reference standard to assess the presence of replicas. We report the balanced accuracy at the optimal threshold to assess replica classification performance. The reference visual rating identified 45 of 50 and 5 of 50 generated images as replicas for the NCCT and TOF-MRA use cases, respectively. Image-level and feature-level measures perfectly classified replicas with a balanced accuracy of 1 when an optimal threshold was selected for the NCCT use case. A perfect classification of replicas for the TOF-MRA case was not possible at any threshold, with the segmentation-level analysis achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.79. Replica detection is a crucial but neglected validation step for the development of generative models in medical imaging. The proposed RELICT framework provides a standardized, easy-to-use tool for replica detection and aims to facilitate responsible and ethical medical image synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Shang, Gabriel Kreiman, Haim Sompolinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans and other animals readily generalize abstract relations, such as recognizing constant in shape or color, whereas neural networks struggle. To investigate how neural networks generalize abstract relations, we introduce SimplifiedRPM, a novel benchmark for systematic evaluation. In parallel, we conduct human experiments to benchmark relational difficulty, enabling direct model-human comparisons. Testing four architectures--ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Wild Relation Network, and Scattering Compositional Learner (SCL)--we find that SCL best aligns with human behavior and generalizes best. Building on a geometric theory of neural representations, we show representational geometries that predict generalization. Layer-wise analysis reveals distinct relational reasoning strategies across models and suggests a trade-off where unseen rule representations compress into training-shaped subspaces. Guided by our geometric perspective, we propose and evaluate SNRloss, a novel objective balancing representation geometry. Our findings offer geometric insights into how neural networks generalize abstract relations, paving the way for more human-like visual reasoning in AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoeri Poels, Cristina Venturini, Alessandro Pau, Olivier Sauter, Vlado Menkovski, the TCV team, the WPTE team</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximizing fusion performance in tokamaks relies on high energy confinement, often achieved through distinct operating regimes. The automated labeling of these confinement states is crucial to enable large-scale analyses or for real-time control applications. While this task becomes difficult to automate near state transitions or in marginal scenarios, much success has been achieved with data-driven models. However, these methods generally provide predictions as point estimates, and cannot adequately deal with missing and/or broken input signals. To enable wide-range applicability, we develop methods for confinement state classification with uncertainty quantification and model robustness. We focus on off-line analysis for TCV discharges, distinguishing L-mode, H-mode, and an in-between dithering phase (D). We propose ensembling data-driven methods on two axes: model formulations and feature sets. The former considers a dynamic formulation based on a recurrent Fourier Neural Operator-architecture and a static formulation based on gradient-boosted decision trees. These models are trained using multiple feature groupings categorized by diagnostic system or physical quantity. A dataset of 302 TCV discharges is fully labeled, and will be publicly released. We evaluate our method quantitatively using Cohen's kappa coefficient for predictive performance and the Expected Calibration Error for the uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, we discuss performance using a variety of common and alternative scenarios, the performance of individual components, out-of-distribution performance, cases of broken or missing signals, and evaluate conditionally-averaged behavior around different state transitions. Overall, the proposed method can distinguish L, D and H-mode with high performance, can cope with missing or broken signals, and provides meaningful uncertainty estimates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Jingzhou Liu, Yulong Li, Kenneth Shaw, Tony Tao, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Deepak Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: Many contact-rich tasks humans perform, such as box pickup or rolling dough, rely on force feedback for reliable execution. However, this force information, which is readily available in most robot arms, is not commonly used in teleoperation and policy learning. Consequently, robot behavior is often limited to quasi-static kinematic tasks that do not require intricate force-feedback. In this paper, we first present a low-cost, intuitive, bilateral teleoperation setup that relays external forces of the follower arm back to the teacher arm, facilitating data collection for complex, contact-rich tasks. We then introduce FACTR, a policy learning method that employs a curriculum which corrupts the visual input with decreasing intensity throughout training. The curriculum prevents our transformer-based policy from over-fitting to the visual input and guides the policy to properly attend to the force modality. We demonstrate that by fully utilizing the force information, our method significantly improves generalization to unseen objects by 43\% compared to baseline approaches without a curriculum.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Li, Mingxi Jia, Tuluhan Akbulut, Yu Xiang, George Konidaris, Srinath Sridhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception. Our model and dataset will be made open source upon acceptance of the paper. Project website: https://lhy.xyz/projects/v-hop/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichi Zhang, Yici Yan, Alex Schwing, Zhizhen Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: We formulate a hierarchical rectified flow to model data distributions. It hierarchically couples multiple ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and defines a time-differentiable stochastic process that generates a data distribution from a known source distribution. Each ODE resembles the ODE that is solved in a classic rectified flow, but differs in its domain, i.e., location, velocity, acceleration, etc. Unlike the classic rectified flow formulation, which formulates a single ODE in the location domain and only captures the expected velocity field (sufficient to capture a multi-modal data distribution), the hierarchical rectified flow formulation models the multi-modal random velocity field, acceleration field, etc., in their entirety. This more faithful modeling of the random velocity field enables integration paths to intersect when the underlying ODE is solved during data generation. Intersecting paths in turn lead to integration trajectories that are more straight than those obtained in the classic rectified flow formulation, where integration paths cannot intersect. This leads to modeling of data distributions with fewer neural function evaluations. We empirically verify this on synthetic 1D and 2D data as well as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-32 data.

<p>Abstract: Modularization is a cornerstone of computer science, abstracting complex functions into atomic building blocks. In this paper, we introduce a new level of modularization by abstracting generative models into atomic generative modules. Analogous to fractals in mathematics, our method constructs a new type of generative model by recursively invoking atomic generative modules, resulting in self-similar fractal architectures that we call fractal generative models. As a running example, we instantiate our fractal framework using autoregressive models as the atomic generative modules and examine it on the challenging task of pixel-by-pixel image generation, demonstrating strong performance in both likelihood estimation and generation quality. We hope this work could open a new paradigm in generative modeling and provide a fertile ground for future research. Code is available at https://github.com/LTH14/fractalgen.</p>

<p>Abstract: Patients take care of what their teeth will be like after the orthodontics. Orthodontists usually describe the expectation movement based on the original smile images, which is unconvincing. The growth of deep-learning generative models change this situation. It can visualize the outcome of orthodontic treatment and help patients foresee their future teeth and facial appearance. While previous studies mainly focus on 2D or 3D virtual treatment outcome (VTO) at a profile level, the problem of simulating treatment outcome at a frontal facial image is poorly explored. In this paper, we build an efficient and accurate system for simulating virtual teeth alignment effects in a frontal facial image. Our system takes a frontal face image of a patient with visible malpositioned teeth and the patient's 3D scanned teeth model as input, and progressively generates the visual results of the patient's teeth given the specific orthodontics planning steps from the doctor (i.e., the specification of translations and rotations of individual tooth). We design a multi-modal encoder-decoder based generative model to synthesize identity-preserving frontal facial images with aligned teeth. In addition, the original image color information is used to optimize the orthodontic outcomes, making the results more natural. We conduct extensive qualitative and clinical experiments and also a pilot study to validate our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Camera calibration involves estimating camera parameters to infer geometric features from captured sequences, which is crucial for computer vision and robotics. However, conventional calibration is laborious and requires dedicated collection. Recent efforts show that learning-based solutions have the potential to be used in place of the repeatability works of manual calibrations. Among these solutions, various learning strategies, networks, geometric priors, and datasets have been investigated. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of learning-based camera calibration techniques, by analyzing their strengths and limitations. Our main calibration categories include the standard pinhole camera model, distortion camera model, cross-view model, and cross-sensor model, following the research trend and extended applications. As there is no unified benchmark in this community, we collect a holistic calibration dataset that can serve as a public platform to evaluate the generalization of existing methods. It comprises both synthetic and real-world data, with images and videos captured by different cameras in diverse scenes. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the challenges and provide further research directions. To our knowledge, this is the first survey for the learning-based camera calibration (spanned 10 years).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Debbagh</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured output representation is a generative task explored in computer vision that often times requires the mapping of low dimensional features to high dimensional structured outputs. Losses in complex spatial information in deterministic approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) lead to uncertainties and ambiguous structures within a single output representation. A probabilistic approach through deep Conditional Generative Models (CGM) is presented by Sohn et al. in which a particular model known as the Conditional Variational Auto-encoder (CVAE) is introduced and explored. While the original paper focuses on the task of image segmentation, this paper adopts the CVAE framework for the task of controlled output representation through attributes. This approach allows us to learn a disentangled multimodal prior distribution, resulting in more controlled and robust approach to sample generation. In this work we recreate the CVAE architecture and train it on images conditioned on various attributes obtained from two image datasets; the Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) dataset and the Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB-200-2011) dataset. We attempt to generate new faces with distinct attributes such as hair color and glasses, as well as different bird species samples with various attributes. We further introduce strategies for improving generalized sample generation by applying a weighted term to the variational lower bound.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Christian Nauen, Sebastian Palacio, Federico Raue, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-attention in Transformers comes with a high computational cost because of their quadratic computational complexity, but their effectiveness in addressing problems in language and vision has sparked extensive research aimed at enhancing their efficiency. However, diverse experimental conditions, spanning multiple input domains, prevent a fair comparison based solely on reported results, posing challenges for model selection. To address this gap in comparability, we perform a large-scale benchmark of more than 45 models for image classification, evaluating key efficiency aspects, including accuracy, speed, and memory usage. Our benchmark provides a standardized baseline for efficiency-oriented transformers. We analyze the results based on the Pareto front -- the boundary of optimal models. Surprisingly, despite claims of other models being more efficient, ViT remains Pareto optimal across multiple metrics. We observe that hybrid attention-CNN models exhibit remarkable inference memory- and parameter-efficiency. Moreover, our benchmark shows that using a larger model in general is more efficient than using higher resolution images. Thanks to our holistic evaluation, we provide a centralized resource for practitioners and researchers, facilitating informed decisions when selecting or developing efficient transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Wan, Nan Kang, Zeqing Wang, Zhuojie Yang, Liang Lin, Keze Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Visual Programming (VProg) has emerged as a significant framework for visual reasoning (VR) tasks due to its interpretability and cross-task generality. However, even with invoking powerful pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) as visual sub-modules, the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks is markedly inferior compared to well-trained task-specific networks. Although invoking task-specific models can further enhance the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks, it greatly diminishes the cross-task generalization ability of VProg. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VProg prevents direct fine-tuning on specific VR tasks for further performance improvement. Attempt to address these issues, we propose SDVP, a Stepwise Distillation learning strategy for non-differentiable VPorg across various VR tasks. Specifically, our SDVP stepwise distills the capabilities of existing, well-trained small task-specific models for decomposed visual sub-tasks in VProg into the much larger VLMs invoked by corresponding visual sub-modules. Besides, distilling the knowledge of little-size task-specific models into pre-trained larger VLMs rather than replacing them helps keep the cross-task abilities of VProgs. Extensive and comprehensive experimental results on different VProg frameworks demonstrate that our SDVP obtains significant performance gains on specific VR benchmarks, i.e., GQA (+2.4\%) and NLVRv2 (+6.2\%) for VisProg and GQA (+6.5\%) and NLVRv2 (+4.0\%) for ViperGPT, and also maintains a promising performance for VProg on unseen and previous VR tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Li, Yupeng Deng, Yunlong Kong, Diyou Liu, Jingbo Chen, Yu Meng, Junxian Ma, Chenhao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: More accurate extraction of invisible building footprints from very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial images relies on roof segmentation and roof-to-footprint offset extraction. Existing methods based on instance segmentation suffer from poor generalization when extended to large-scale data production and fail to achieve low-cost human interaction. This prompt paradigm inspires us to design a promptable framework for roof and offset extraction, and transforms end-to-end algorithms into promptable methods. Within this framework, we propose a novel Offset-Building Model (OBM). Based on prompt prediction, we first discover a common pattern of predicting offsets and tailored Distance-NMS (DNMS) algorithms for offset optimization. To rigorously evaluate the algorithm's capabilities, we introduce a prompt-based evaluation method, where our model reduces offset errors by 16.6\% and improves roof Intersection over Union (IoU) by 10.8\% compared to other models. Leveraging the common patterns in predicting offsets, DNMS algorithms enable models to further reduce offset vector loss by 6.5\%. To further validate the generalization of models, we tested them using a newly proposed test set, Huizhou test set, with over 7,000 manually annotated instance samples. Our algorithms and dataset will be available at https://github.com/likaiucas/OBM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models have increasingly impacted various tasks, from computer vision to interior design and beyond. Stable Diffusion, a powerful diffusion model, enables the creation of high-resolution images with intricate details from text prompts or reference images. An intriguing challenge lies in improving performance for small datasets with image-sparse categories. This study explores the effectiveness of Stable Diffusion by evaluating seven common categories and three widespread weed species. Synthetic images were generated using three Stable Diffusion-based techniques: Image-to-Image Translation, DreamBooth, and ControlNet, each with distinct focuses. Classification and detection tasks were then performed on these synthetic images, and their performance was compared to models trained on original images. Promising results were achieved for certain classes, demonstrating the potential of Stable Diffusion in enhancing image-sparse datasets. This foundational study may accelerate the adaptation of diffusion models across various domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxu Xu, Yitian Yuan, Qiudan Zhang, Wenhui Wu, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma, Xu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning to ground natural language queries to target objects or regions in 3D point clouds is quite essential for 3D scene understanding. Nevertheless, existing 3D visual grounding approaches require a substantial number of bounding box annotations for text queries, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose 3D-VLA, a weakly supervised approach for 3D visual grounding based on Visual Linguistic Alignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior ability of current large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds with no need for fine-grained box annotations in the training procedure. During the inference stage, the learned text-3D correspondence will help us ground the text queries to the 3D target objects even without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly supervised manner by involving large scale vision-language models, and extensive experiments on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our 3D-VLA achieves comparable and even superior results over the fully supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Ioannis Bountos, Arthur Ouaknine, Ioannis Papoutsis, David Rolnick</p>
<p>Abstract: Forests are vital to ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and essential services, but are rapidly changing due to land use and climate change. Understanding and mitigating negative effects requires parsing data on forests at global scale from a broad array of sensory modalities, and using them in diverse forest monitoring applications. Such diversity in data and applications can be effectively addressed through the development of a large, pre-trained foundation model that serves as a versatile base for various downstream tasks. However, remote sensing modalities, which are an excellent fit for several forest management tasks, are particularly challenging considering the variation in environmental conditions, object scales, image acquisition modes, spatio-temporal resolutions, etc. With that in mind, we present the first unified Forest Monitoring Benchmark (FoMo-Bench), carefully constructed to evaluate foundation models with such flexibility. FoMo-Bench consists of 15 diverse datasets encompassing satellite, aerial, and inventory data, covering a variety of geographical regions, and including multispectral, red-green-blue, synthetic aperture radar and LiDAR data with various temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions. FoMo-Bench includes multiple types of forest-monitoring tasks, spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection. To enhance task and geographic diversity in FoMo-Bench, we introduce TalloS, a global dataset combining satellite imagery with ground-based annotations for tree species classification across 1,000+ categories and hierarchical taxonomic levels. Finally, we propose FoMo-Net, a pre-training framework to develop foundation models with the capacity to process any combination of commonly used modalities and spectral bands in remote sensing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Pujol-Perich, Albert Clap\'es, Sergio Escalera</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) is a complex task that poses relevant challenges, particularly when attempting to generalize on new -- unseen -- domains in real-world applications. These scenarios, despite realistic, are often neglected in the literature, exposing these solutions to important performance degradation. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing, for the first time, an approach for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in sparse TAL, which we refer to as Semantic Adversarial unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SADA). Our contributions are threefold: (1) we pioneer the development of a domain adaptation model that operates on realistic sparse action detection benchmarks; (2) we tackle the limitations of global-distribution alignment techniques by introducing a novel adversarial loss that is sensitive to local class distributions, ensuring finer-grained adaptation; and (3) we present a novel set of benchmarks based on EpicKitchens100 and CharadesEgo, that evaluate multiple domain shifts in a comprehensive manner. Our experiments indicate that SADA improves the adaptation across domains when compared to fully supervised state-of-the-art and alternative UDA methods, attaining a performance boost of up to 6.14% mAP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaisheng Ding, Haiyan Li, Ruichao Hou, Yanyu Liu, Shidong Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing robust multi-modal feature representations is crucial for enhancing object tracking performance. In pursuit of this objective, a novel X Modality Assisting Network (X-Net) is introduced, which explores the impact of the fusion paradigm by decoupling visual object tracking into three distinct levels, thereby facilitating subsequent processing. Initially, to overcome the challenges associated with feature learning due to significant discrepancies between RGB and thermal modalities, a plug-and-play pixel-level generation module (PGM) based on knowledge distillation learning is proposed. This module effectively generates the X modality, bridging the gap between the two patterns while minimizing noise interference. Subsequently, to optimize sample feature representation and promote cross-modal interactions, a feature-level interaction module (FIM) is introduced, integrating a mixed feature interaction transformer and a spatial dimensional feature translation strategy. Finally, to address random drifting caused by missing instance features, a flexible online optimization strategy called the decision-level refinement module (DRM) is proposed, which incorporates optical flow and refinement mechanisms. The efficacy of X-Net is validated through experiments on three benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art trackers. Notably, X-Net achieves performance gains of 0.47%/1.2% in the average of precise rate and success rate, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guikun Chen, Wenguan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (GS) has emerged as a transformative technique in explicit radiance field and computer graphics. This innovative approach, characterized by the use of millions of learnable 3D Gaussians, represents a significant departure from mainstream neural radiance field approaches, which predominantly use implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering algorithm, not only promises real-time rendering capability but also introduces unprecedented levels of editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research. Through this survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for both newcomers and seasoned researchers, fostering further exploration and advancement in explicit radiance field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binh M. Le, Jiwon Kim, Shahroz Tariq, Kristen Moore, Alsharif Abuadbba, Simon S. Woo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deepfakes have rapidly emerged as a profound and serious threat to society, primarily due to their ease of creation and dissemination. This situation has triggered an accelerated development of deepfake detection technologies. However, many existing detectors rely heavily on lab-generated datasets for validation, which may not effectively prepare them for novel, emerging, and real-world deepfake techniques. In this paper, we conduct an extensive and comprehensive review and analysis of the latest state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, evaluating them against several critical criteria. These criteria facilitate the categorization of these detectors into 4 high-level groups and 13 fine-grained sub-groups, all aligned with a unified standard conceptual framework. This classification and framework offer deep and practical insights into the factors that affect detector efficacy. We assess the generalizability of 16 leading detectors across various standard attack scenarios, including black-box, white-box, and gray-box settings. Our systematized analysis and experimentation lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of deepfake detectors and their generalizability, paving the way for future research focused on creating detectors adept at countering various attack scenarios. Additionally, this work offers insights for developing more proactive defenses against deepfakes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngsik Yun, Jihie Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Captioning generates descriptive sentences from images using Vision-Language Pre-trained models (VLPs) such as BLIP, which has improved greatly. However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC), that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs.

<p>Abstract: Map representations learned by expert demonstrations have shown promising research value. However, the field of visual navigation still faces challenges due to the lack of real-world human-navigation datasets that can support efficient, supervised, representation learning of environments. We present a Landmark-Aware Visual Navigation (LAVN) dataset to allow for supervised learning of human-centric exploration policies and map building. We collect RGBD observation and human point-click pairs as a human annotator explores virtual and real-world environments with the goal of full coverage exploration of the space. The human annotators also provide distinct landmark examples along each trajectory, which we intuit will simplify the task of map or graph building and localization. These human point-clicks serve as direct supervision for waypoint prediction when learning to explore in environments. Our dataset covers a wide spectrum of scenes, including rooms in indoor environments, as well as walkways outdoors. We release our dataset with detailed documentation at https://huggingface.co/datasets/visnavdataset/lavn (DOI: 10.57967/hf/2386) and a plan for long-term preservation.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01505">SCott: Accelerating Diffusion Models with Stochastic Consistency Distillation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjian Liu, Qingsong Xie, TianXiang Ye, Zhijie Deng, Chen Chen, Shixiang Tang, Fueyang Fu, Zheng-jun Zha, Haonan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The iterative sampling procedure employed by diffusion models (DMs) often leads to significant inference latency. To address this, we propose Stochastic Consistency Distillation (SCott) to enable accelerated text-to-image generation, where high-quality generations can be achieved with just 1-2 sampling steps, and further improvements can be obtained by adding additional steps. In contrast to vanilla consistency distillation (CD) which distills the ordinary differential equation solvers-based sampling process of a pretrained teacher model into a student, SCott explores the possibility and validates the efficacy of integrating stochastic differential equation (SDE) solvers into CD to fully unleash the potential of the teacher. SCott is augmented with elaborate strategies to control the noise strength and sampling process of the SDE solver. An adversarial loss is further incorporated to strengthen the sample quality with rare sampling steps. Empirically, on the MSCOCO-2017 5K dataset with a Stable Diffusion-V1.5 teacher, SCott achieves an FID (Frechet Inceptio Distance) of 22.1, surpassing that (23.4) of the 1-step InstaFlow (Liu et al., 2023) and matching that of 4-step UFOGen (Xue et al., 2023b). Moreover, SCott can yield more diverse samples than other consistency models for high-resolution image generation (Luo et al., 2023a), with up to 16% improvement in a qualified metric. The code and checkpoints are coming soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Shangguan, Daniel Seita, Mohammad Rostami</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal feature extraction and integration have led to steady performance improvements in few-shot learning tasks due to generating richer features. However, existing multi-modal object detection (MM-OD) methods degrade when facing significant domain-shift and are sample insufficient. We hypothesize that rich text information could more effectively help the model to build a knowledge relationship between the vision instance and its language description and can help mitigate domain shift. Specifically, we study the Cross-Domain few-shot generalization of MM-OD (CDMM-FSOD) and propose a meta-learning based multi-modal few-shot object detection method that utilizes rich text semantic information as an auxiliary modality to achieve domain adaptation in the context of FSOD. Our proposed network contains (i) a multi-modal feature aggregation module that aligns the vision and language support feature embeddings and (ii) a rich text semantic rectify module that utilizes bidirectional text feature generation to reinforce multi-modal feature alignment and thus to enhance the model's language understanding capability. We evaluate our model on common standard cross-domain object detection datasets and demonstrate that our approach considerably outperforms existing FSOD methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tung-Yu Wu, Sheng-Yu Huang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify the target object within a 3D point cloud scene referred to by a natural language description. Previous works usually require significant data relating to point color and their descriptions to exploit the corresponding complicated verbo-visual relations. In our work, we introduce Vigor, a novel Data-Efficient 3D Visual Grounding framework via Order-aware Referring. Vigor leverages LLM to produce a desirable referential order from the input description for 3D visual grounding. With the proposed stacked object-referring blocks, the predicted anchor objects in the above order allow one to locate the target object progressively without supervision on the identities of anchor objects or exact relations between anchor/target objects. In addition, we present an order-aware warm-up training strategy, which augments referential orders for pre-training the visual grounding framework. This allows us to better capture the complex verbo-visual relations and benefit the desirable data-efficient learning scheme. Experimental results on the NR3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate our superiority in low-resource scenarios. In particular, Vigor surpasses current state-of-the-art frameworks by 9.3% and 7.6% grounding accuracy under 1% data and 10% data settings on the NR3D dataset, respectively.

We investigate how extensive world knowledge and strong reasoning skills of underlying LLMs influence this strong performance. Surprisingly, we discover that LLM-based approaches can yield surprisingly good accuracy on long-video tasks with limited video information, sometimes even with no video specific information. Building on this, we explore injecting video-specific information into an LLM-based framework. We utilize off-the-shelf vision tools to extract three object-centric information modalities from videos, and then leverage natural language as a medium for fusing this information. Our resulting Multimodal Video Understanding (MVU) framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binbin Huang, Zehao Yu, Anpei Chen, Andreas Geiger, Shenghua Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently revolutionized radiance field reconstruction, achieving high quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering speed without baking. However, 3DGS fails to accurately represent surfaces due to the multi-view inconsistent nature of 3D Gaussians. We present 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), a novel approach to model and reconstruct geometrically accurate radiance fields from multi-view images. Our key idea is to collapse the 3D volume into a set of 2D oriented planar Gaussian disks. Unlike 3D Gaussians, 2D Gaussians provide view-consistent geometry while modeling surfaces intrinsically. To accurately recover thin surfaces and achieve stable optimization, we introduce a perspective-correct 2D splatting process utilizing ray-splat intersection and rasterization. Additionally, we incorporate depth distortion and normal consistency terms to further enhance the quality of the reconstructions. We demonstrate that our differentiable renderer allows for noise-free and detailed geometry reconstruction while maintaining competitive appearance quality, fast training speed, and real-time rendering.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present the Draw-and-Understand framework, exploring how to integrate visual prompting understanding capabilities into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Visual prompts allow users to interact through multi-modal instructions, enhancing the models' interactivity and fine-grained image comprehension. In this framework, we propose a general architecture adaptable to different pre-trained MLLMs, enabling it to recognize various types of visual prompts (such as points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes) alongside language understanding. Additionally, we introduce MDVP-Instruct-Data, a multi-domain dataset featuring 1.2 million image-visual prompt-text triplets, including natural images, document images, scene text images, mobile/web screenshots, and remote sensing images. Building on this dataset, we introduce MDVP-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate a model's ability to understand visual prompting instructions. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework can be easily and effectively applied to various MLLMs, such as SPHINX-X and LLaVA. After training with MDVP-Instruct-Data and image-level instruction datasets, our models exhibit impressive multimodal interaction capabilities and pixel-level understanding, while maintaining their image-level visual perception performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatically generating webpage code from webpage designs can significantly reduce the workload of front-end developers, and recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in this area. However, our investigation reveals that most existing MLLMs are constrained by the absence of high-quality, large-scale, real-world datasets, resulting in inadequate performance in automated webpage code generation. To fill this gap, this paper introduces WebCode2M, a new dataset comprising 2.56 million instances, each containing a design image along with the corresponding webpage code and layout details. Sourced from real-world web resources, WebCode2M offers a rich and valuable dataset for webpage code generation across a variety of applications. The dataset quality is ensured by a scoring model that filters out instances with aesthetic deficiencies or other incomplete elements. To validate the effectiveness of WebCode2M, we introduce a baseline model based on the Vision Transformer (ViT), named WebCoder, and establish a benchmark for fair comparison. Additionally, we introduce a new metric, TreeBLEU, to measure the structural hierarchy recall. The benchmarking results demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves the ability of MLLMs to generate code from webpage designs, confirming its effectiveness and usability for future applications in front-end design tools. Finally, we highlight several practical challenges introduced by our dataset, calling for further research.

<p>Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a method for non-contact measurement of physiological signals from facial videos, holding great potential in various applications such as healthcare, affective computing, and anti-spoofing. Existing deep learning methods struggle to address two core issues of rPPG simultaneously: understanding the periodic pattern of rPPG among long contexts and addressing large spatiotemporal redundancy in video segments. These represent a trade-off between computational complexity and the ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce RhythmMamba, a state space model-based method that captures long-range dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. By viewing rPPG as a time series task through the proposed frame stem, the periodic variations in pulse waves are modeled as state transitions. Additionally, we design multi-temporal constraint and frequency domain feed-forward, both aligned with the characteristics of rPPG time series, to improve the learning capacity of Mamba for rPPG signals. Extensive experiments show that RhythmMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with 319% throughput and 23% peak GPU memory.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuzheng Yu, Chen Jiang, Xingning Dong, Tian Gan, Ming Yang, Qingpei Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The user base of short video apps has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, resulting in a significant demand for video content analysis. In particular, text-video retrieval, which aims to find the top matching videos given text descriptions from a vast video corpus, is an essential function, the primary challenge of which is to bridge the modality gap. Nevertheless, most existing approaches treat texts merely as discrete tokens and neglect their syntax structures. Moreover, the abundant spatial and temporal clues in videos are often underutilized due to the lack of interaction with text. To address these issues, we argue that using texts as guidance to focus on relevant temporal frames and spatial regions within videos is beneficial. In this paper, we propose a novel Syntax-Hierarchy-Enhanced text-video retrieval method (SHE-Net) that exploits the inherent semantic and syntax hierarchy of texts to bridge the modality gap from two perspectives. First, to facilitate a more fine-grained integration of visual content, we employ the text syntax hierarchy, which reveals the grammatical structure of text descriptions, to guide the visual representations. Second, to further enhance the multi-modal interaction and alignment, we also utilize the syntax hierarchy to guide the similarity calculation. We evaluated our method on four public text-video retrieval datasets of MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet. The experimental results and ablation studies confirm the advantages of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Liangxiu Han, Tam Sobeih, Lianghao Han, Darren Dancey</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth estimation is a critical task in computer vision, with applications in autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Event cameras, which encode temporal changes in light intensity as asynchronous binary spikes, offer unique advantages such as low latency, high dynamic range, and energy efficiency. However, their unconventional spiking output and the scarcity of labelled datasets pose significant challenges to traditional image-based depth estimation methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel energy-efficient Spike-Driven Transformer Network (SDT) for depth estimation, leveraging the unique properties of spiking data. The proposed SDT introduces three key innovations: (1) a purely spike-driven transformer architecture that incorporates spike-based attention and residual mechanisms, enabling precise depth estimation with minimal energy consumption; (2) a fusion depth estimation head that combines multi-stage features for fine-grained depth prediction while ensuring computational efficiency; and (3) a cross-modality knowledge distillation framework that utilises a pre-trained vision foundation model (DINOv2) to enhance the training of the spiking network despite limited data availability.This work represents the first exploration of transformer-based spiking neural networks for depth estimation, providing a significant step forward in energy-efficient neuromorphic computing for real-world vision applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyidan Xie, Rui Ma, Qian Wang, Xiaoqian Ye, Feixuan Liu, Ying Tai, Zhenyu Zhang, Lanjun Wang, Zili Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in image-conditioned image generation have demonstrated substantial progress. However, foreground-conditioned image generation remains underexplored, encountering challenges such as compromised object integrity, foreground-background inconsistencies, limited diversity, and reduced control flexibility. These challenges arise from current end-to-end inpainting models, which suffer from inaccurate training masks, limited foreground semantic understanding, data distribution biases, and inherent interference between visual and textual prompts. To overcome these limitations, we present Anywhere, a multi-agent framework that departs from the traditional end-to-end approach. In this framework, each agent is specialized in a distinct aspect, such as foreground understanding, diversity enhancement, object integrity protection, and textual prompt consistency. Our framework is further enhanced with the ability to incorporate optional user textual inputs, perform automated quality assessments, and initiate re-generation as needed. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that this modular design effectively overcomes the limitations of existing end-to-end models, resulting in higher fidelity, quality, diversity and controllability in foreground-conditioned image generation. Additionally, the Anywhere framework is extensible, allowing it to benefit from future advancements in each individual agent.</p>

The integration of drones equipped with advanced imaging techniques represents a transformative leap forward, optimising harvests and promising sustainable practices. We propose WildBe, the first image dataset of wild berries captured in peatlands and under the canopy of Finnish forests using drones. Unlike previous and related datasets, WildBe includes new varieties of berries, such as bilberries, cloudberries, lingonberries, and crowberries, captured under severe light variations and in cluttered environments. WildBe features 3,516 images, including a total of 18,468 annotated bounding boxes. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of WildBe using six popular object detectors, assessing their effectiveness in berry detection across different forest regions and camera types.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Wang, Kuan Tian, Yonghang Guan, Fei Shen, Zhiwei Jiang, Qing Gu, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of the text-guided diffusion model has inspired the development and release of numerous powerful diffusion models within the open-source community. These models are typically fine-tuned on various expert datasets, showcasing diverse denoising capabilities. Leveraging multiple high-quality models to produce stronger generation ability is valuable, but has not been extensively studied. Existing methods primarily adopt parameter merging strategies to produce a new static model. However, they overlook the fact that the divergent denoising capabilities of the models may dynamically change across different states, such as when experiencing different prompts, initial noises, denoising steps, and spatial locations. In this paper, we propose a novel ensembling method, Adaptive Feature Aggregation (AFA), which dynamically adjusts the contributions of multiple models at the feature level according to various states (i.e., prompts, initial noises, denoising steps, and spatial locations), thereby keeping the advantages of multiple diffusion models, while suppressing their disadvantages. Specifically, we design a lightweight Spatial-Aware Block-Wise (SABW) feature aggregator that adaptive aggregates the block-wise intermediate features from multiple U-Net denoisers into a unified one. The core idea lies in dynamically producing an individual attention map for each model's features by comprehensively considering various states. It is worth noting that only SABW is trainable with about 50 million parameters, while other models are frozen. Both the quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Adaptive Feature Aggregation method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks, such as generating realistic images or videos based on textual instructions. However, larger model sizes and multi-frame processing for video generation lead to increased computational and memory costs, posing challenges for practical deployment on edge devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective method for reducing memory costs and computational complexity. When quantizing diffusion transformers, we find that existing quantization methods face challenges when applied to text-to-image and video tasks. To address these challenges, we begin by systematically analyzing the source of quantization error and conclude with the unique challenges posed by DiT quantization. Accordingly, we design an improved quantization scheme: ViDiT-Q (Video & Image Diffusion Transformer Quantization), tailored specifically for DiT models. We validate the effectiveness of ViDiT-Q across a variety of text-to-image and video models, achieving W8A8 and W4A8 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics. Additionally, we implement efficient GPU kernels to achieve practical 2-2.5x memory saving and a 1.4-1.7x end-to-end latency speedup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haizhong Zheng, Elisa Tsai, Yifu Lu, Jiachen Sun, Brian R. Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Atul Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality human-annotated data is crucial for modern deep learning pipelines, yet the human annotation process is both costly and time-consuming. Given a constrained human labeling budget, selecting an informative and representative data subset for labeling can significantly reduce human annotation effort. Well-performing state-of-the-art (SOTA) coreset selection methods require ground truth labels over the whole dataset, failing to reduce the human labeling burden. Meanwhile, SOTA label-free coreset selection methods deliver inferior performance due to poor geometry-based difficulty scores. In this paper, we introduce ELFS (Effective Label-Free Coreset Selection), a novel label-free coreset selection method. ELFS significantly improves label-free coreset selection by addressing two challenges: 1) ELFS utilizes deep clustering to estimate training dynamics-based data difficulty scores without ground truth labels; 2) Pseudo-labels introduce a distribution shift in the data difficulty scores, and we propose a simple but effective double-end pruning method to mitigate bias on calculated scores. We evaluate ELFS on four vision benchmarks and show that, given the same vision encoder, ELFS consistently outperforms SOTA label-free baselines. For instance, when using SwAV as the encoder, ELFS outperforms D2 by up to 10.2% in accuracy on ImageNet-1K. We make our code publicly available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zhang, Zhongqi Wang, Mengqi Lei, Zheng Yuan, Bei Yan, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the perception ability of the Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, most benchmarks conduct questions by selecting images from existing datasets, resulting in the potential data leakage. Besides, these benchmarks merely focus on evaluating LVLMs on the realistic style images and clean scenarios, leaving the multi-stylized images and noisy scenarios unexplored. In response to these challenges, we propose a dynamic and scalable benchmark named Dysca for evaluating LVLMs by leveraging synthesis images. Specifically, we leverage Stable Diffusion and design a rule-based method to dynamically generate novel images, questions and the corresponding answers. We consider 51 kinds of image styles and evaluate the perception capability in 20 subtasks. Moreover, we conduct evaluations under 4 scenarios (i.e., Clean, Corruption, Print Attacking and Adversarial Attacking) and 3 question types (i.e., Multi-choices, True-or-false and Free-form). Thanks to the generative paradigm, Dysca serves as a scalable benchmark for easily adding new subtasks and scenarios. A total of 24 advanced open-source LVLMs and 2 close-source LVLMs are evaluated on Dysca, revealing the drawbacks of current LVLMs. The benchmark is released at https://github.com/Robin-WZQ/Dysca.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that, a good style representation is crucial and sufficient for generalized style transfer without test-time tuning. We achieve this through constructing a style-aware encoder and a well-organized style dataset called StyleGallery. With dedicated design for style learning, this style-aware encoder is trained to extract expressive style representation with decoupling training strategy, and StyleGallery enables the generalization ability. We further employ a content-fusion encoder to enhance image-driven style transfer. We highlight that, our approach, named StyleShot, is simple yet effective in mimicking various desired styles, i.e., 3D, flat, abstract or even fine-grained styles, without test-time tuning. Rigorous experiments validate that, StyleShot achieves superior performance across a wide range of styles compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01636">Learning Dual Transformers for All-In-One Image Restoration from a Frequency Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Chu, Tong Su, Pei Liu, Yunpeng Wu, Le Zhang, Zenglin Shi, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work aims to tackle the all-in-one image restoration task, which seeks to handle multiple types of degradation with a single model. The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Building on the insight that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new dual-transformer approach comprising two components: a frequency-aware Degradation estimation transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing the input into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in five representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring, and low-light enhancement. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling, real-world degradations, spatially variant degradations, and unseen degradation levels.</p>

However, existing point cloud upsampling inputs are all patch based, and there is no research discussing the differences and principles between point cloud model full input and patch based input. In order to compare with patch based point cloud input, this article proposes a new data input method, which divides the full point cloud model to ensure shape integrity while training PU-GCN. This article was validated on the PU1K and ABC datasets, but the results showed that Patch based performance is better than model based full input i.e. Average Segment input. Therefore, this article explores the data input factors and model modules that affect the upsampling results of point clouds.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce CHAMP, a novel method for learning sequence-to-sequence, multi-hypothesis 3D human poses from 2D keypoints by leveraging a conditional distribution with a diffusion model. To predict a single output 3D pose sequence, we generate and aggregate multiple 3D pose hypotheses. For better aggregation results, we develop a method to score these hypotheses during training, effectively integrating conformal prediction into the learning process. This process results in a differentiable conformal predictor that is trained end2end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned scoring model is used as the conformity score, and the 3D pose estimator is combined with a conformal predictor to select the most accurate hypotheses for downstream aggregation. Our results indicate that using a simple mean aggregation on the conformal prediction-filtered hypotheses set yields competitive results. When integrated with more sophisticated aggregation techniques, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual storytelling involves generating a sequence of coherent frames from a textual storyline while maintaining consistency in characters and scenes. Existing autoregressive methods, which rely on previous frame-sentence pairs, struggle with high memory usage, slow generation speeds, and limited context integration. To address these issues, we propose ContextualStory, a novel framework designed to generate coherent story frames and extend frames for visual storytelling. ContextualStory utilizes Spatially-Enhanced Temporal Attention to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, handling significant character movements effectively. Additionally, we introduce a Storyline Contextualizer to enrich context in storyline embedding, and a StoryFlow Adapter to measure scene changes between frames for guiding the model. Extensive experiments on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets demonstrate that ContextualStory significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in both story visualization and continuation.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models are becoming increasingly crucial due to their ability to generate high-quality images, but also raise concerns about social biases, particularly in human image generation. Sociological research has established systematic classifications of bias. Yet, existing studies on bias in T2I models largely conflate different types of bias, impeding methodological progress. In this paper, we introduce BIGbench, a unified benchmark for Biases of Image Generation, featuring a carefully designed dataset. Unlike existing benchmarks, BIGbench classifies and evaluates biases across four dimensions to enable a more granular evaluation and deeper analysis. Furthermore, BIGbench applies advanced multi-modal large language models to achieve fully automated and highly accurate evaluations. We apply BIGbench to evaluate eight representative T2I models and three debiasing methods. Our human evaluation results by trained evaluators from different races underscore BIGbench's effectiveness in aligning images and identifying various biases. Moreover, our study also reveals new research directions about biases with insightful analysis of our results. Our work is openly accessible at https://github.com/BIGbench2024/BIGbench2024/.</p>

Unlike previous work that jointly models the global hair structure and local curl patterns, we propose to disentangle them using a PCA-based strand representation in the frequency domain, thereby allowing more precise editing and output control. Specifically, we leverage our strand representation to fit and decompose hair geometry textures into low- to high-frequency hair structures, termed guide textures and residual textures, respectively. These decomposed textures are later parameterized with different generative models, emulating common stages in the hair grooming process. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the architecture design of Perm, and finally deploy the trained model as a generic prior to solve task-agnostic problems, further showcasing its flexibility and superiority in tasks such as single-view hair reconstruction, hairstyle editing, and hair-conditioned image generation.

<p>Abstract: Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims to measure physiological signals and Heart Rate (HR) from facial videos. Recent unsupervised rPPG estimation methods have shown promising potential in estimating rPPG signals from facial regions without relying on ground truth rPPG signals. However, these methods seem oblivious to interference existing in rPPG signals and still result in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a novel De-interfered and Descriptive rPPG Estimation Network (DD-rPPGNet) to eliminate the interference within rPPG features for learning genuine rPPG signals. First, we investigate the characteristics of local spatial-temporal similarities of interference and design a novel unsupervised model to estimate the interference. Next, we propose an unsupervised de-interfered method to learn genuine rPPG signals with two stages. In the first stage, we estimate the initial rPPG signals by contrastive learning from both the training data and their augmented counterparts. In the second stage, we use the estimated interference features to derive de-interfered rPPG features and encourage the rPPG signals to be distinct from the interference. In addition, we propose an effective descriptive rPPG feature learning by developing a strong 3D Learnable Descriptive Convolution (3DLDC) to capture the subtle chrominance changes for enhancing rPPG estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on five rPPG benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DD-rPPGNet outperforms previous unsupervised rPPG estimation methods and achieves competitive performances with state-of-the-art supervised rPPG methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate measurement of image quality without reference signals remains a fundamental challenge in low-level visual perception applications. In this paper, we propose a global-local progressive integration model that addresses this challenge through three key contributions: 1) We develop a dual-measurement framework that combines vision Transformer (ViT)-based global feature extractor and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based local feature extractor to comprehensively capture and quantify image distortion characteristics at different granularities. 2) We propose a progressive feature integration scheme that utilizes multi-scale kernel configurations to align global and local features, and progressively aggregates them via an interactive stack of channel-wise self-attention and spatial interaction modules for multi-grained quality-aware representations. 3) We introduce a semantic-aligned quality transfer method that extends the training data by automatically labeling the quality scores of diverse image content with subjective opinion scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our model yields 5.04% and 5.40% improvements in Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) for cross-authentic and cross-synthetic dataset generalization tests, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed semantic-aligned quality transfer further yields 2.26% and 13.23% performance gains in evaluations on single-synthetic and cross-synthetic datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoli Deng, Fanyi Wang, Junkang Zhang, Fan Chen, Meng Zhang, Wendong Zhang, Wen Liu, Zhenpeng Mi</p>
<p>Abstract: Portrait Fidelity Generation is a prominent research area in generative models.Current methods face challenges in generating full-body images with low-resolution faces, especially in multi-ID photo phenomenon.To tackle these issues, we propose a comprehensive system called FPGA and construct a million-level multi-modal dataset IDZoom for training.FPGA consists of Multi-Mode Fusion training strategy (MMF) and DDIM Inversion based ID Restoration inference framework (DIIR). The MMF aims to activate the specified ID in the specified facial region. The DIIR aims to address the issue of face artifacts while keeping the background.Furthermore, DIIR is plug-and-play and can be applied to any diffusion-based portrait generation method to enhance their performance. DIIR is also capable of performing face-swapping tasks and is applicable to stylized faces as well.To validate the effectiveness of FPGA, we conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that FPGA has significant advantages in both subjective and objective metrics, and achieves controllable generation in multi-ID scenarios. In addition, we accelerate the inference speed to within 2.5 seconds on a single L20 graphics card mainly based on our well designed reparameterization method, RepControlNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongliang Guo, Chun Tong Lei, Lei Fang, Shuai Zhao, Yifei Qian, Jingyu Lin, Zeyu Wang, Cunjian Chen, Ognjen Arandjelovi\'c, Chun Pong Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), have revolutionized image synthesis and manipulation. However, these generative techniques raises concerns about data misappropriation and intellectual property infringement. Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have been extensively studied, and a well-established body of research has extended these techniques as a benign metric to prevent the underlying misuse of generative AI. Current approaches to safeguarding images from manipulation by LDMs are limited by their reliance on model-specific knowledge and their inability to significantly degrade semantic quality of generated images. In response to these shortcomings, we propose the Posterior Collapse Attack (PCA) based on the observation that VAEs suffer from posterior collapse during training. Our method minimizes dependence on the white-box information of target models to get rid of the implicit reliance on model-specific knowledge. By accessing merely a small amount of LDM parameters, in specific merely the VAE encoder of LDMs, our method causes a substantial semantic collapse in generation quality, particularly in perceptual consistency, and demonstrates strong transferability across various model architectures. Experimental results show that PCA achieves superior perturbation effects on image generation of LDMs with lower runtime and VRAM. Our method outperforms existing techniques, offering a more robust and generalizable solution that is helpful in alleviating the socio-technical challenges posed by the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Liu, Chen Jia, Fan Shi, Xu Cheng, Mianzhao Wang, Shengyong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting cracks with pixel-level precision for key structures is a significant challenge, existing methods struggle to integrate local textures and pixel dependencies of cracks. Furthermore, these methods possess numerous parameters and substantial computational requirements, complicating deployment on edge devices. In this paper, we propose the Staircase Cascaded Fusion Crack Segmentation Network (CrackSCF), which generates high-quality crack segmentation maps while reducing computational overhead. We design a lightweight convolutional block that substitutes all convolution operations, reducing the model's computational demands while maintaining an effective capture of local details. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight long-range dependency extractor to better capture the long-range dependencies. Furthermore, we develop a staircase cascaded fusion module, which seamlessly integrates local patterns and long-range dependencies, resulting in high-quality segmentation maps. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we created the challenging TUT benchmark dataset and evaluated it alongside five other public datasets. The results show that our method outperforms existing methods, particularly in handling background noise and achieving detailed segmentation. The F1 and mIoU scores on the TUT dataset are 0.8382 and 0.8473, respectively, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with low computational resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Horatiu Florea, Sergiu Nedevschi</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial scene understanding systems face stringent payload restrictions and must often rely on monocular depth estimation for modeling scene geometry, which is an inherently ill-posed problem. Moreover, obtaining accurate ground truth data required by learning-based methods raises significant additional challenges in the aerial domain. Self-supervised approaches can bypass this problem, at the cost of providing only up-to-scale results. Similarly, recent supervised solutions which make good progress towards zero-shot generalization also provide only relative depth values. This work presents TanDepth, a practical scale recovery method for obtaining metric depth results from relative estimations at inference-time, irrespective of the type of model generating them. Tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, our method leverages sparse measurements from Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEM) by projecting them to the camera view using extrinsic and intrinsic information. An adaptation to the Cloth Simulation Filter is presented, which allows selecting ground points from the estimated depth map to then correlate with the projected reference points. We evaluate and compare our method against alternate scaling methods adapted for UAVs, on a variety of real-world scenes. Considering the limited availability of data for this domain, we construct and release a comprehensive, depth-focused extension to the popular UAVid dataset to further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Hsi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in surveillance, security, and airspace management has created an urgent demand for precise, scalable, and efficient UAV detection. However, existing datasets often suffer from limited scale diversity and inaccurate annotations, hindering robust model development. This paper introduces UAVDB, a high-resolution UAV detection dataset constructed using Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC). This novel technique automatically generates high-fidelity bounding box annotations from UAV trajectory data~\cite{li2020reconstruction}, eliminating the need for manual labeling. UAVDB features single-class annotations with a fixed-camera setup and consists of RGB frames capturing UAVs across various scales, from large-scale UAVs to near-single-pixel representations, along with challenging backgrounds that pose difficulties for modern detectors. We first validate the accuracy and efficiency of PIC-generated bounding boxes by comparing Intersection over Union (IoU) performance and runtime against alternative annotation methods, demonstrating that PIC achieves higher annotation accuracy while being more efficient. Subsequently, we benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO-series detectors, establishing UAVDB as a valuable resource for advancing long-range and high-resolution UAV detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep visual odometry, despite extensive research, still faces limitations in accuracy and generalizability that prevent its broader application. To address these challenges, we propose an Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)-guided visual odometry with selective online adaptation named ORB-SfMLearner. We present a novel use of ORB features for learning-based ego-motion estimation, leading to more robust and accurate results. We also introduce the cross-attention mechanism to enhance the explainability of PoseNet and have revealed that driving direction of the vehicle can be explained through the attention weights. To improve generalizability, our selective online adaptation allows the network to rapidly and selectively adjust to the optimal parameters across different domains. Experimental results on KITTI and vKITTI datasets show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep visual odometry methods in terms of ego-motion accuracy and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Min-Si Ren, Yan-Ming Zhang, Yi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text plays a crucial role in the transmission of human civilization, and teaching machines to generate online handwritten text in various styles presents an interesting and significant challenge. However, most prior work has concentrated on generating individual Chinese fonts, leaving {complete text line generation largely unexplored}. In this paper, we identify that text lines can naturally be divided into two components: layout and glyphs. Based on this division, we designed a text line layout generator coupled with a diffusion-based stylized font synthesizer to address this challenge hierarchically. More concretely, the layout generator performs in-context-like learning based on the text content and the provided style references to generate positions for each glyph autoregressively. Meanwhile, the font synthesizer which consists of a character embedding dictionary, a multi-scale calligraphy style encoder, and a 1D U-Net based diffusion denoiser will generate each font on its position while imitating the calligraphy style extracted from the given style references. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on the CASIA-OLHWDB demonstrate that our method is capable of generating structurally correct and indistinguishable imitation samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyuan Wang, Ziwei Wang, Xiuwei Xu, Yansong Tang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework of large vision-language models (LVLMs) for efficient multi-modal inference. Conventional quantization methods sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by minimizing activation discretization errors, which fails to acquire optimal quantization strategy without considering cross-layer dependency. On the contrary, we mine the cross-layer dependency that significantly influences discretization errors of the entire vision-language model, and embed this dependency into optimal quantization strategy searching with low search cost. Specifically, we observe the strong correlation between the activation entropy and the cross-layer dependency concerning output discretization errors. Therefore, we employ the entropy as the proxy to partition blocks optimally, which aims to achieve satisfying trade-offs between discretization errors and the search cost. Moreover, we optimize the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained decomposition of search space, so that the search cost is further reduced without harming the quantization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method compresses the memory by 2.78x and increase generate speed by 1.44x about 13B LLaVA model without performance degradation on diverse multi-modal reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandeep Nagar, Girish Varma</p>
<p>Abstract: The inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm with running time $O(\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation of the same. Inverse of Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use the Inverse of Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm for optimizing the inverse of convolution layer, resulting in fast training times also. We implement this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Schnepf, Karim Kassab, Jean-Yves Franceschi, Laurent Caraffa, Flavian Vasile, Jeremie Mary, Andrew Comport, Valerie Gouet-Brunet</p>
<p>Abstract: While pre-trained image autoencoders are increasingly utilized in computer vision, the application of inverse graphics in 2D latent spaces has been under-explored. Yet, besides reducing the training and rendering complexity, applying inverse graphics in the latent space enables a valuable interoperability with other latent-based 2D methods. The major challenge is that inverse graphics cannot be directly applied to such image latent spaces because they lack an underlying 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose an Inverse Graphics Autoencoder (IG-AE) that specifically addresses this issue. To this end, we regularize an image autoencoder with 3D-geometry by aligning its latent space with jointly trained latent 3D scenes. We utilize the trained IG-AE to bring NeRFs to the latent space with a latent NeRF training pipeline, which we implement in an open-source extension of the Nerfstudio framework, thereby unlocking latent scene learning for its supported methods. We experimentally confirm that Latent NeRFs trained with IG-AE present an improved quality compared to a standard autoencoder, all while exhibiting training and rendering accelerations with respect to NeRFs trained in the image space.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minheng Chen, Chao Cao, Tong Chen, Yan Zhuang, Jing Zhang, Yanjun Lyu, Xiaowei Yu, Lu Zhang, Tianming Liu, Dajiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The 3-hinge gyrus (3HG) is a newly defined folding pattern, which is the conjunction of gyri coming from three directions in cortical folding. Many studies demonstrated that 3HGs can be reliable nodes when constructing brain networks or connectome since they simultaneously possess commonality and individuality across different individual brains and populations. However, 3HGs are identified and validated within individual spaces, making it difficult to directly serve as the brain network nodes due to the absence of cross-subject correspondence. The 3HG correspondences represent the intrinsic regulation of brain organizational architecture, traditional image-based registration methods tend to fail because individual anatomical properties need to be fully respected. To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for anatomical feature embedding of the 3HGs to build the correspondences among different brains. The core component of this framework is to construct a structural similarity-enhanced multi-hop feature encoding strategy based on the recently developed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) for anatomical feature embedding. Extensive experiments suggest that our approach can effectively establish robust cross-subject correspondences when no one-to-one mapping exists.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive benchmark analysis of various YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithms, from YOLOv3 to the newest addition. It represents the first research to comprehensively evaluate the performance of YOLO11, the latest addition to the YOLO family. It evaluates their performance on three diverse datasets: Traffic Signs (with varying object sizes), African Wildlife (with diverse aspect ratios and at least one instance of the object per image), and Ships and Vessels (with small-sized objects of a single class), ensuring a comprehensive assessment across datasets with distinct challenges. To ensure a robust evaluation, we employ a comprehensive set of metrics, including Precision, Recall, Mean Average Precision (mAP), Processing Time, GFLOPs count, and Model Size. Our analysis highlights the distinctive strengths and limitations of each YOLO version. For example: YOLOv9 demonstrates substantial accuracy but struggles with detecting small objects and efficiency whereas YOLOv10 exhibits relatively lower accuracy due to architectural choices that affect its performance in overlapping object detection but excels in speed and efficiency. Additionally, the YOLO11 family consistently shows superior performance in terms of accuracy, speed, computational efficiency, and model size. YOLO11m achieved a remarkable balance of accuracy and efficiency, scoring mAP50-95 scores of 0.795, 0.81, and 0.325 on the Traffic Signs, African Wildlife, and Ships datasets, respectively, while maintaining an average inference time of 2.4ms, a model size of 38.8Mb, and around 67.6 GFLOPs on average. These results provide critical insights for both industry and academia, facilitating the selection of the most suitable YOLO algorithm for diverse applications and guiding future enhancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengke Zou, Xingang Guo, Rui Yang, Junyu Zhang, Bin Hu, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great potential in tackling mathematical reasoning tasks that involve visual context. Unlike humans who can reliably apply solution steps to similar problems with minor modifications, we found that SOTA VLMs like GPT-4o can consistently fail in these scenarios, revealing limitations in their mathematical reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the mathematical reasoning robustness in VLMs and evaluate how well these models perform under different variants of the same question, such as changes in visual numerical values or function graphs. While several vision-based math benchmarks have been developed to assess VLMs' problem-solving capabilities, these benchmarks contain only static sets of problems and cannot easily evaluate mathematical reasoning robustness. To fill this gap, we introduce DynaMath, a dynamic visual math benchmark designed for in-depth assessment of VLMs. DynaMath includes 501 high-quality, multi-topic seed questions, each represented as a Python program. Those programs are carefully designed and annotated to enable the automatic generation of a much larger set of concrete questions, including many different types of visual and textual variations. DynaMath allows us to evaluate the generalization ability of VLMs, by assessing their performance under varying input conditions of a seed question. We evaluated 14 SOTA VLMs with 5,010 generated concrete questions. Our results show that the worst-case model accuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly answered seed questions in all 10 variants, is significantly lower than the average-case accuracy. Our analysis emphasizes the need to study the robustness of VLMs' reasoning abilities, and DynaMath provides valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable models for mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwen Jiao, Yangyi Fang, Baoyun Peng, Wangqun Chen, Bharadwaj Veeravalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have made them crucial for visual question answering (VQA) in autonomous driving, enabling natural human-vehicle interactions. However, existing methods often struggle in dynamic driving environments, as they usually focus on static images or videos and rely on downsampling to manage computational costs. This results in the loss of critical details and the difficulty in effectively integrating spatial and temporal information, undermining fine-grained perception and temporal coherence essential for effective decision-making. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LaVida Drive, a novel and efficient VQA framework for autonomous driving. LaVida Drive seamlessly integrates temporal data while maintaining high-resolution inputs for detailed visual perception. It optimizes spatial processing by retaining high-resolution data for intricate details and using lower-resolution inputs for temporal analysis to focus on motion-related features, thereby boosting computational efficiency. The core of LaVida Drive consists of two modules: the \textit{Query-aware Token Selection} module and the \textit{Spatial-Temporal Token Recovery and Enhancement} module. The former dynamically selects the most relevant visual tokens based on semantic alignment with the input query, reducing the token count from high-resolution spatial input. The latter ensures smooth and coherent interactions between spatial and temporal information, preserving contextual continuity across frames. Extensive experiments on various autonomous driving question-answering benchmarks show that LaVida Drive significantly reduces visual tokens, enhances efficiency, and improves overall performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Datao Tang, Xiangyong Cao, Xuan Wu, Jialin Li, Jing Yao, Xueru Bai, Dongsheng Jiang, Yin Li, Deyu Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image object detection (RSIOD) aims to identify and locate specific objects within satellite or aerial imagery. However, there is a scarcity of labeled data in current RSIOD datasets, which significantly limits the performance of current detection algorithms. Although existing techniques, e.g., data augmentation and semi-supervised learning, can mitigate this scarcity issue to some extent, they are heavily dependent on high-quality labeled data and perform worse in rare object classes. To address this issue, this paper proposes a layout-controllable diffusion generative model (i.e. AeroGen) tailored for RSIOD. To our knowledge, AeroGen is the first model to simultaneously support horizontal and rotated bounding box condition generation, thus enabling the generation of high-quality synthetic images that meet specific layout and object category requirements. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end data augmentation framework that integrates a diversity-conditioned generator and a filtering mechanism to enhance both the diversity and quality of generated data. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data produced by our method are of high quality and diversity. Furthermore, the synthetic RSIOD data can significantly improve the detection performance of existing RSIOD models, i.e., the mAP metrics on DIOR, DIOR-R, and HRSC datasets are improved by 3.7%, 4.3%, and 2.43%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seong-Eun Hong, Soobin Lim, Juyeong Hwang, Minwook Chang, Hyeongyeop Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating natural and expressive human motions from textual descriptions is challenging due to the complexity of coordinating full-body dynamics and capturing nuanced motion patterns over extended sequences that accurately reflect the given text. To address this, we introduce BiPO, Bidirectional Partial Occlusion Network for Text-to-Motion Synthesis, a novel model that enhances text-to-motion synthesis by integrating part-based generation with a bidirectional autoregressive architecture. This integration allows BiPO to consider both past and future contexts during generation while enhancing detailed control over individual body parts without requiring ground-truth motion length. To relax the interdependency among body parts caused by the integration, we devise the Partial Occlusion technique, which probabilistically occludes the certain motion part information during training. In our comprehensive experiments, BiPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HumanML3D dataset, outperforming recent methods such as ParCo, MoMask, and BAMM in terms of FID scores and overall motion quality. Notably, BiPO excels not only in the text-to-motion generation task but also in motion editing tasks that synthesize motion based on partially generated motion sequences and textual descriptions. These results reveal the BiPO's effectiveness in advancing text-to-motion synthesis and its potential for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungwon Park, Jungmin Ko, Dongnam Byun, Jangwon Suh, Wonjong Rhee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models leverage cross-attention layers, which have been effectively utilized to enhance a range of visual generative tasks. However, our understanding of cross-attention layers remains somewhat limited. In this study, we introduce a mechanistic interpretability approach for diffusion models by constructing Head Relevance Vectors (HRVs) that align with human-specified visual concepts. An HRV for a given visual concept has a length equal to the total number of cross-attention heads, with each element representing the importance of the corresponding head for the given visual concept. To validate HRVs as interpretable features, we develop an ordered weakening analysis that demonstrates their effectiveness. Furthermore, we propose concept strengthening and concept adjusting methods and apply them to enhance three visual generative tasks. Our results show that HRVs can reduce misinterpretations of polysemous words in image generation, successfully modify five challenging attributes in image editing, and mitigate catastrophic neglect in multi-concept generation. Overall, our work provides an advancement in understanding cross-attention layers and introduces new approaches for fine-controlling these layers at the head level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghan Long, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in text-guided and image-conditioned image generation. However, existing diffusion models cannot simultaneously generate an image and a panoptic segmentation of objects and stuff from the prompt. Incorporating an inherent understanding of shapes and scene layouts can improve the creativity and realism of diffusion models. To address this limitation, we present Panoptic Diffusion Model (PDM), the first model designed to generate both images and panoptic segmentation maps concurrently. PDM bridges the gap between image and text by constructing segmentation layouts that provide detailed, built-in guidance throughout the generation process. This ensures the inclusion of categories mentioned in text prompts and enriches the diversity of segments within the background. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PDM across two architectures: a unified diffusion transformer and a two-stream transformer with a pretrained backbone. We propose a Multi-Scale Patching mechanism to generate high-resolution segmentation maps. Additionally, when ground-truth maps are available, PDM can function as a text-guided image-to-image generation model. Finally, we propose a novel metric for evaluating the quality of generated maps and show that PDM achieves state-of-the-art results in image generation with implicit scene control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruibo Ming, Jingwei Wu, Zhewei Huang, Zhuoxuan Ju, Jianming HU, Lihui Peng, Shuchang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) have led to their application in video generation. This paper explores the use of Large Vision Models (LVMs) for video continuation, a task essential for building world models and predicting future frames. We introduce ARCON, a scheme that alternates between generating semantic and RGB tokens, allowing the LVM to explicitly learn high-level structural video information. We find high consistency in the RGB images and semantic maps generated without special design. Moreover, we employ an optical flow-based texture stitching method to enhance visual quality. Experiments in autonomous driving scenarios show that our model can consistently generate long videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenting Xu, Viorela Ila, Luping Zhou, Craig T. Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of function and affordance is a critical aspect of 3D scene understanding and supports task-oriented objectives. In this work, we develop a model that learns to structure and vary functional affordance across a 3D hierarchical scene graph representing the spatial organization of a scene. The varying functional affordance is designed to integrate with the varying spatial context of the graph. More specifically, we develop an algorithm that learns to construct a 3D hierarchical scene graph (3DHSG) that captures the spatial organization of the scene. Starting from segmented object point clouds and object semantic labels, we develop a 3DHSG with a top node that identifies the room label, child nodes that define local spatial regions inside the room with region-specific affordances, and grand-child nodes indicating object locations and object-specific affordances. To support this work, we create a custom 3DHSG dataset that provides ground truth data for local spatial regions with region-specific affordances and also object-specific affordances for each object. We employ a transformer-based model to learn the 3DHSG. We use a multi-task learning framework that learns both room classification and learns to define spatial regions within the room with region-specific affordances. Our work improves on the performance of state-of-the-art baseline models and shows one approach for applying transformer models to 3D scene understanding and the generation of 3DHSGs that capture the spatial organization of a room. The code and dataset are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Fang, Arvind Easwaran, Blaise Genest, Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous OOD detection systems only focus on the semantic gap between ID and OOD samples. Besides the semantic gap, we are faced with two additional gaps: the domain gap between source and target domains, and the class-imbalance gap between different classes. In fact, similar objects from different domains should belong to the same class. In this paper, we introduce a realistic yet challenging setting: class-imbalanced cross-domain OOD detection (CCOD), which contains a well-labeled (but usually small) source set for training and conducts OOD detection on an unlabeled (but usually larger) target set for testing. We do not assume that the target domain contains only OOD classes or that it is class-balanced: the distribution among classes of the target dataset need not be the same as the source dataset. To tackle this challenging setting with an OOD detection system, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware adaptive semantic alignment (UASA) network based on a prototype-based alignment strategy. Specifically, we first build label-driven prototypes in the source domain and utilize these prototypes for target classification to close the domain gap. Rather than utilizing fixed thresholds for OOD detection, we generate adaptive sample-wise thresholds to handle the semantic gap. Finally, we conduct uncertainty-aware clustering to group semantically similar target samples to relieve the class-imbalance gap. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed UASA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Huang, Jinghui Zhang, Guang Li, Lei Zhang, Shuoyuan Wang, Fang Dong, Jiahui Jin, Takahiro Ogawa, Miki Haseyama</p>
<p>Abstract: In few-shot action recognition (FSAR), long sub-sequences of video naturally express entire actions more effectively. However, the high computational complexity of mainstream Transformer-based methods limits their application. Recent Mamba demonstrates efficiency in modeling long sequences, but directly applying Mamba to FSAR overlooks the importance of local feature modeling and alignment. Moreover, long sub-sequences within the same class accumulate intra-class variance, which adversely impacts FSAR performance. To solve these challenges, we propose a Matryoshka MAmba and CoNtrasTive LeArning framework (Manta). Firstly, the Matryoshka Mamba introduces multiple Inner Modules to enhance local feature representation, rather than directly modeling global features. An Outer Module captures dependencies of timeline between these local features for implicit temporal alignment. Secondly, a hybrid contrastive learning paradigm, combining both supervised and unsupervised methods, is designed to mitigate the negative effects of intra-class variance accumulation. The Matryoshka Mamba and the hybrid contrastive learning paradigm operate in two parallel branches within Manta, enhancing Mamba for FSAR of long sub-sequence. Manta achieves new state-of-the-art performance on prominent benchmarks, including SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical studies prove that Manta significantly improves FSAR of long sub-sequence from multiple perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaocan Chen, Qilin Yin, Jiarui Liu, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo, Jiantao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Talking face generation (TFG) allows for producing lifelike talking videos of any character using only facial images and accompanying text. Abuse of this technology could pose significant risks to society, creating the urgent need for research into corresponding detection methods. However, research in this field has been hindered by the lack of public datasets. In this paper, we construct the first large-scale multi-scenario talking face dataset (MSTF), which contains 22 audio and video forgery techniques, filling the gap of datasets in this field. The dataset covers 11 generation scenarios and more than 20 semantic scenarios, closer to the practical application scenario of TFG. Besides, we also propose a TFG detection framework, which leverages the analysis of both global and local coherence in the multimodal content of TFG videos. Therefore, a region-focused smoothness detection module (RSFDM) and a discrepancy capture-time frame aggregation module (DCTAM) are introduced to evaluate the global temporal coherence of TFG videos, aggregating multi-grained spatial information. Additionally, a visual-audio fusion module (V-AFM) is designed to evaluate audiovisual coherence within a localized temporal perspective. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the reasonableness and challenges of our datasets, while also indicating the superiority of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art deepfake detection approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Yan, Zied Bouraoui, Fangyun Wei, Chang Xu, Ping Wang, Shoaib Jameel, Steven Schockaert</p>
<p>Abstract: The aim of multi-label few-shot image classification (ML-FSIC) is to assign semantic labels to images, in settings where only a small number of training examples are available for each label. A key feature of the multi-label setting is that an image often has several labels, which typically refer to objects appearing in different regions of the image. When estimating label prototypes, in a metric-based setting, it is thus important to determine which regions are relevant for which labels, but the limited amount of training data and the noisy nature of local features make this highly challenging. As a solution, we propose a strategy in which label prototypes are gradually refined. First, we initialize the prototypes using word embeddings, which allows us to leverage prior knowledge about the meaning of the labels. Second, taking advantage of these initial prototypes, we then use a Loss Change Measurement (LCM) strategy to select the local features from the training images (i.e. the support set) that are most likely to be representative of a given label. Third, we construct the final prototype of the label by aggregating these representative local features using a multi-modal cross-interaction mechanism, which again relies on the initial word embedding-based prototypes. Experiments on COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, and iMaterialist show that our model substantially improves the current state-of-the-art.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13845">Do Language Models Understand Time?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Ding, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized video-based computer vision applications, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and video summarization. Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos? This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond.

<p>Abstract: We propose scaling up 3D scene reconstruction by training with synthesized data. At the core of our work is MegaSynth, a procedurally generated 3D dataset comprising 700K scenes - over 50 times larger than the prior real dataset DL3DV - dramatically scaling the training data. To enable scalable data generation, our key idea is eliminating semantic information, removing the need to model complex semantic priors such as object affordances and scene composition. Instead, we model scenes with basic spatial structures and geometry primitives, offering scalability. Besides, we control data complexity to facilitate training while loosely aligning it with real-world data distribution to benefit real-world generalization. We explore training LRMs with both MegaSynth and available real data. Experiment results show that joint training or pre-training with MegaSynth improves reconstruction quality by 1.2 to 1.8 dB PSNR across diverse image domains. Moreover, models trained solely on MegaSynth perform comparably to those trained on real data, underscoring the low-level nature of 3D reconstruction. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of MegaSynth's properties for enhancing model capability, training stability, and generalization, as well as application to other tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihao Gu, Yingyao Wang, Meng Cao, Pi Bu, Jun Song, Yancheng He, Shilong Li, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been demonstrated to be highly effective in mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by aligning their outputs more closely with human preferences. Despite the recent progress, existing methods suffer from two drawbacks: 1) Lack of scalable token-level rewards; and 2) Neglect of visual-anchored tokens. To this end, we propose a novel Token Preference Optimization model with self-calibrated rewards (dubbed as TPO), which adaptively attends to visual-correlated tokens without fine-grained annotations. Specifically, we introduce a token-level \emph{visual-anchored} \emph{reward} as the difference of the logistic distributions of generated tokens conditioned on the raw image and the corrupted one. In addition, to highlight the informative visual-anchored tokens, a visual-aware training objective is proposed to enhance more accurate token-level optimization. Extensive experimental results have manifested the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed TPO. For example, by building on top of LLAVA-1.5-7B, our TPO boosts the performance absolute improvement for hallucination benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal Human-Object Interaction (ST-HOI) understanding aims at detecting HOIs from videos, which is crucial for activity understanding. However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines. Data and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/DirtyHarryLYL/HAKE-AVA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiujie Song, Xiaoyi Pang, Haifeng Tang, Mengyue Wu, Kenny Q. Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying image complexity at the entity level is straightforward, but the assessment of semantic complexity has been largely overlooked. In fact, there are differences in semantic complexity across images. Images with richer semantics can tell vivid and engaging stories and offer a wide range of application scenarios. For example, the Cookie Theft picture is such a kind of image and is widely used to assess human language and cognitive abilities due to its higher semantic complexity. Additionally, semantically rich images can benefit the development of vision models, as images with limited semantics are becoming less challenging for them. However, such images are scarce, highlighting the need for a greater number of them. For instance, there is a need for more images like Cookie Theft to cater to people from different cultural backgrounds and eras. Assessing semantic complexity requires human experts and empirical evidence. Automatic evaluation of how semantically rich an image will be the first step of mining or generating more images with rich semantics, and benefit human cognitive assessment, Artificial Intelligence, and various other applications. In response, we propose the Image Semantic Assessment (ISA) task to address this problem. We introduce the first ISA dataset and a novel method that leverages language to solve this vision problem. Experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jushang Qiu, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition has gained significant attention for its ability to efficiently represent spatiotemporal information in a lightweight format. Most existing approaches use graph-based models to process skeleton sequences, where each pose is represented as a skeletal graph structured around human physical connectivity. Among these, the Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) has become a widely used framework. Alternatively, hypergraph-based models, such as the Hyperformer, capture higher-order correlations, offering a more expressive representation of complex joint interactions. A recent advancement, termed Taylor Videos, introduces motion-enhanced skeleton sequences by embedding motion concepts, providing a fresh perspective on interpreting human actions in skeleton-based action recognition. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both traditional skeleton sequences and Taylor-transformed skeletons using ST-GCN and Hyperformer models on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets. We compare skeletal graph and hypergraph representations, analyzing static poses against motion-injected poses. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of Taylor-transformed skeletons, demonstrating their potential to enhance motion dynamics while exposing current challenges in fully using their benefits. This study underscores the need for innovative skeletal modelling techniques to effectively handle motion-rich data and advance the field of action recognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence in poultry farming has highlighted the challenge of efficiently labeling large, diverse datasets. Manual annotation is time-consuming and costly, making it impractical for modern systems that continuously generate data. This study addresses this challenge by exploring semi-supervised auto-labeling methods, integrating self and active learning approaches to develop an efficient, label-scarce framework for auto-labeling large poultry datasets (ALPD). For this study, video data were collected from broilers and laying hens housed. Various machine learning models, including zero-shot models and supervised models, were utilized for broilers and hens detection. The results showed that YOLOv8s-World and YOLOv9s performed better when compared performance metrics for broiler and hen detection under supervised learning, while among the semi-supervised model, YOLOv8s-ALPD achieved the highest precision (96.1%) and recall (99%) with an RMSE of 1.87. The hybrid YOLO-World model, incorporating the optimal YOLOv8s backbone with zero-shot models, demonstrated the highest overall performance. It achieved a precision of 99.2%, recall of 99.4%, and an F1 score of 98.7% for detection. In addition, the semi-supervised models with minimal human intervention (active learning) reduced annotation time by over 80% compared to full manual labeling. Moreover, integrating zero-shot models with the best models enhanced broiler and hen detection, achieving comparable results to supervised models while significantly increasing speed. In conclusion, integrating semi-supervised auto-labeling and zero-shot models significantly improves detection accuracy. It reduces manual annotation efforts, offering a promising solution to optimize AI-driven systems in poultry farming, advancing precision livestock management, and promoting more sustainable practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muxi Chen, Chenchen Zhao, Qiang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant success of deep learning models in computer vision, they often exhibit systematic failures on specific data subsets, known as error slices. Identifying and mitigating these error slices is crucial to enhancing model robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce DebugAgent, an automated framework for error slice discovery and model repair. DebugAgent first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, DebugAgent extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that DebugAgent not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramchandran Muthukumar, Ambar Pal, Jeremias Sulam, Rene Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning systems are vulnerable to small perturbations to their input, where ``small'' is defined according to a threat model that assigns a positive threat to each perturbation. Most prior works define a task-agnostic, isotropic, and global threat, like the $\ell_p$ norm, where the magnitude of the perturbation fully determines the degree of the threat and neither the direction of the attack nor its position in space matter. However, common corruptions in computer vision, such as blur, compression, or occlusions, are not well captured by such threat models. This paper proposes a novel threat model called \texttt{Projected Displacement} (PD) to study robustness beyond existing isotropic and global threat models. The proposed threat model measures the threat of a perturbation via its alignment with \textit{unsafe directions}, defined as directions in the input space along which a perturbation of sufficient magnitude changes the ground truth class label. Unsafe directions are identified locally for each input based on observed training data. In this way, the PD threat model exhibits anisotropy and locality. Experiments on Imagenet-1k data indicate that, for any input, the set of perturbations with small PD threat includes \textit{safe} perturbations of large $\ell_p$ norm that preserve the true label, such as noise, blur and compression, while simultaneously excluding \textit{unsafe} perturbations that alter the true label. Unlike perceptual threat models based on embeddings of large-vision models, the PD threat model can be readily computed for arbitrary classification tasks without pre-training or finetuning. Further additional task annotation such as sensitivity to image regions or concept hierarchies can be easily integrated into the assessment of threat and thus the PD threat model presents practitioners with a flexible, task-driven threat specification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xichen Xu, Wentao Chen, Weimin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: It is widely accepted that medical imaging systems should be objectively assessed via task-based image quality (IQ) measures that ideally account for all sources of randomness in the measured image data, including the variation in the ensemble of objects to be imaged. Stochastic object models (SOMs) that can randomly draw samples from the object distribution can be employed to characterize object variability. To establish realistic SOMs for task-based IQ analysis, it is desirable to employ experimental image data. However, experimental image data acquired from medical imaging systems are subject to measurement noise. Previous work investigated the ability of deep generative models (DGMs) that employ an augmented generative adversarial network (GAN), AmbientGAN, for establishing SOMs from noisy measured image data. Recently, denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have emerged as a leading DGM for image synthesis and can produce superior image quality than GANs. However, original DDMs possess a slow image-generation process because of the Gaussian assumption in the denoising steps. More recently, denoising diffusion GAN (DDGAN) was proposed to permit fast image generation while maintain high generated image quality that is comparable to the original DDMs. In this work, we propose an augmented DDGAN architecture, Ambient DDGAN (ADDGAN), for learning SOMs from noisy image data. Numerical studies that consider clinical computed tomography (CT) images and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images are conducted. The ability of the proposed ADDGAN to learn realistic SOMs from noisy image data is demonstrated. It has been shown that the ADDGAN significantly outperforms the advanced AmbientGAN models for synthesizing high resolution medical images with complex textures.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04192">PixFoundation: Are We Heading in the Right Direction with Pixel-level Vision Foundation Models?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mennatullah Siam</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple works have emerged to push the boundaries on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) towards pixel-level understanding. Such approaches have shown strong performance on benchmarks for referring expression segmentation and grounded conversation generation. The current trend in pixel-level MLLMs is to train with pixel-level grounding supervision on large-scale labelled data. However, we show that such MLLMs when evaluated on recent challenging vision centric benchmarks, exhibit a weak ability in visual question answering. Surprisingly, some of these methods even downgrade the grounding ability of MLLMs that were never trained with such supervision. In this work, we propose two novel challenging benchmarks and show that MLLMs without pixel-level grounding supervision can outperform the state of the art in such tasks when evaluating both the pixel-level grounding and visual question answering. We propose simple baselines to extract the grounding information that can be plugged into any MLLM, which we call as PixFoundation. More importantly, we study the research question of "When does grounding emerge in MLLMs that are not trained with pixel-level grounding supervision?" We show that grounding can coincide with object parts or location/appearance information. Code repository is at https://github.com/MSiam/PixFoundation/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mozes Jacobs, Roberto C. Budzinski, Lyle Muller, Demba Ba, T. Anderson Keller</p>
<p>Abstract: Traveling waves of neural activity are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" problem -- which highlights how normal modes of wave dynamics encode geometric information -- we investigate whether similar principles can be leveraged in artificial neural networks. Specifically, we introduce convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli, enabling spatial integration. By then treating these wave-like activation sequences as visual representations themselves, we obtain a powerful representational space that outperforms local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, significantly outperforming local feed-forward models and rivaling non-local U-Net models with fewer parameters. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based communication and visual representation in artificial networks, our findings suggest wave-dynamics may provide efficiency and training stability benefits, while simultaneously offering a new framework for connecting models to biological recordings of neural activity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Mule, Matteo Pannacci, Ali Ghasemi Goudarzi, Francesco Pro, Lorenzo Papa, Luca Maiano, Irene Amerini</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in generative AI techniques, which have significantly increased the online dissemination of altered images and videos, have raised serious concerns about the credibility of digital media available on the Internet and distributed through information channels and social networks. This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Qu, Jianan Wei, Xiangbo Shu, Wenguan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning primitive (i.e., attribute and object) concepts from seen compositions is the primary challenge of Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). Existing CZSL solutions typically rely on oversimplified data assumptions, e.g., modeling each primitive with a single centroid primitive representation, ignoring the natural diversities of the attribute (resp. object) when coupled with different objects (resp. attribute). In this work, we develop ClusPro, a robust clustering-based prototype mining framework for CZSL that defines the conceptual boundaries of primitives through a set of diversified prototypes. Specifically, ClusPro conducts within-primitive clustering on the embedding space for automatically discovering and dynamically updating prototypes. These representative prototypes are subsequently used to repaint a well-structured and independent primitive embedding space, ensuring intra-primitive separation and inter-primitive decorrelation through prototype-based contrastive learning and decorrelation learning. Moreover, ClusPro efficiently performs prototype clustering in a non-parametric fashion without the introduction of additional learnable parameters or computational budget during testing. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate ClusPro outperforms various top-leading CZSL solutions under both closed-world and open-world settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hypercomplex image processing extends conventional techniques in a unified paradigm encompassing algebraic and geometric principles. This work leverages quaternions and the two-dimensional orthogonal planes split framework (splitting of a quaternion - representing a pixel - into pairs of orthogonal 2D planes) for natural/biomedical image analysis through the following computational workflows and outcomes: natural/biomedical image re-colorization, natural image de-colorization, natural/biomedical image contrast enhancement, computational re-staining and stain separation in histological images, and performance gains in machine/deep learning pipelines for histological images. The workflows are analyzed separately for natural and biomedical images to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The proposed workflows can regulate color appearance (e.g. with alternative renditions and grayscale conversion) and image contrast, be part of automated image processing pipelines (e.g. isolating stain components, boosting learning models), and assist in digital pathology applications (e.g. enhancing biomarker visibility, enabling colorblind-friendly renditions). Employing only basic arithmetic and matrix operations, this work offers a computationally accessible methodology - in the hypercomplex domain - that showcases versatility and consistency across image processing tasks and a range of computer vision and biomedical applications. The proposed non-data-driven methods achieve comparable or better results (particularly in cases involving well-known methods) to those reported in the literature, showcasing the potential of robust theoretical frameworks with practical effectiveness. Results, methods, and limitations are detailed alongside discussion of promising extensions, emphasizing the potential of feature-rich mathematical/computational frameworks for natural and biomedical images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanke Xia, Ruoxin Peng, Haoqi Chu, Xinlei Zhu, Zhiyu Yang, Yaojun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Rice is one of the most widely cultivated crops globally and has been developed into numerous varieties. The quality of rice during cultivation is primarily determined by its cultivar and characteristics. Traditionally, rice classification and quality assessment rely on manual visual inspection, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. However, with advancements in machine vision technology, automating rice classification and quality evaluation based on its cultivar and characteristics has become increasingly feasible, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes a real-time evaluation mechanism for comprehensive rice grain assessment, integrating a one-stage object detection approach, a deep convolutional neural network, and traditional machine learning techniques. The proposed framework enables rice variety identification, grain completeness grading, and grain chalkiness evaluation. The rice grain dataset used in this study comprises approximately 20,000 images from six widely cultivated rice varieties in China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.14% in the object detection task and an accuracy of 97.89% in the classification task. Furthermore, the framework attains an average accuracy of 97.56% in grain completeness grading within the same rice variety, contributing to an effective quality evaluation system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zhao, Zeyu Zhang, Yi Xu, Yi Yao, Yan Huang, Wenxin Zhang, Zirui Song, Xiuying Chen, Yang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Pedestrian detection in intelligent transportation systems has made significant progress but faces two critical challenges: (1) insufficient fusion of complementary information between visible and infrared spectra, particularly in complex scenarios, and (2) sensitivity to illumination changes, such as low-light or overexposed conditions, leading to degraded performance. To address these issues, we propose PedDet, an adaptive spectral optimization complementarity framework specifically enhanced and optimized for multispectral pedestrian detection. PedDet introduces the Multi-scale Spectral Feature Perception Module (MSFPM) to adaptively fuse visible and infrared features, enhancing robustness and flexibility in feature extraction. Additionally, the Illumination Robustness Feature Decoupling Module (IRFDM) improves detection stability under varying lighting by decoupling pedestrian and background features. We further design a contrastive alignment to enhance intermodal feature discrimination. Experiments on LLVIP and MSDS datasets demonstrate that PedDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the mAP by 6.6% with superior detection accuracy even in low-light conditions, marking a significant step forward for road safety.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shansong Wang, Mojtaba Safari, Qiang Li, Chih-Wei Chang, Richard LJ Qiu, Justin Roper, David S. Yu, Xiaofeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are pre-trained on extensive image datasets to learn general representations for diverse types of data. These models can subsequently be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, significantly boosting performance across a broad range of applications. However, existing vision foundation models that claim to be applicable to various clinical tasks are mostly pre-trained on 3D computed tomography (CT), which benefits from the availability of extensive 3D CT databases. Significant differences between CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in imaging principles, signal characteristics, and data distribution may hinder their practical performance and versatility in MRI-specific applications. Here, we propose Triad, a vision foundation model for 3D MRI. Triad adopts a widely used autoencoder architecture to learn robust representations from 131,170 3D MRI volumes and uses organ-independent imaging descriptions to constrain the semantic distribution of the visual modality. The above pre-training dataset is called Triad-131K, which is currently the largest 3D MRI pre-training dataset. We evaluate Triad across three tasks, namely, organ/tumor segmentation, organ/cancer classification, and medical image registration, in two data modalities (within-domain and out-of-domain) settings using 25 downstream datasets. By initializing models with Triad's pre-trained weights, nnUNet-Triad improves segmentation performance by 2.51% compared to nnUNet-Scratch across 17 datasets. Swin-B-Triad achieves a 3.97% improvement over Swin-B-Scratch in classification tasks across five datasets. SwinUNETR-Triad improves by 4.00% compared to SwinUNETR-Scratch in registration tasks across two datasets. Our study demonstrates that pre-training can improve performance when the data modalities and organs of upstream and downstream tasks are consistent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takahiko Furuya</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained 3D point cloud Transformers has emerged as a promising technique for 3D point cloud analysis. While existing PEFT methods attempt to minimize the number of tunable parameters, they often suffer from high temporal and spatial computational costs during fine-tuning. This paper proposes a novel PEFT algorithm called Side Token Adaptation on a neighborhood Graph (STAG) to achieve superior temporal and spatial efficiency. STAG employs a graph convolutional side network operating in parallel with a frozen backbone Transformer to adapt tokens to downstream tasks. Through efficient graph convolution, parameter sharing, and reduced gradient computation, STAG significantly reduces both temporal and spatial costs for fine-tuning. We also present Point Cloud Classification 13 (PCC13), a new benchmark comprising diverse publicly available 3D point cloud datasets to facilitate comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experiments using multiple pre-trained models and PCC13 demonstrates the effectiveness of STAG. Specifically, STAG maintains classification accuracy comparable to existing methods while reducing tunable parameters to only 0.43M and achieving significant reductions in both computation time and memory consumption for fine-tuning. Code and benchmark will be available at: https://github.com/takahikof/STAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Huang, Yiren Song, Yuxuan Zhang, Hailong Guo, Xueyin Wang, Mike Zheng Shou, Jiaming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce PhotoDoodle, a novel image editing framework designed to facilitate photo doodling by enabling artists to overlay decorative elements onto photographs. Photo doodling is challenging because the inserted elements must appear seamlessly integrated with the background, requiring realistic blending, perspective alignment, and contextual coherence. Additionally, the background must be preserved without distortion, and the artist's unique style must be captured efficiently from limited training data. These requirements are not addressed by previous methods that primarily focus on global style transfer or regional inpainting. The proposed method, PhotoDoodle, employs a two-stage training strategy. Initially, we train a general-purpose image editing model, OmniEditor, using large-scale data. Subsequently, we fine-tune this model with EditLoRA using a small, artist-curated dataset of before-and-after image pairs to capture distinct editing styles and techniques. To enhance consistency in the generated results, we introduce a positional encoding reuse mechanism. Additionally, we release a PhotoDoodle dataset featuring six high-quality styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advanced performance and robustness of our method in customized image editing, opening new possibilities for artistic creation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruochen Li, Stamos Katsigiannis, Tae-Kyun Kim, Hubert P. H. Shum</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction allows better decision-making in applications of autonomous vehicles or surveillance by predicting the short-term future movement of traffic agents. It is classified into pedestrian or heterogeneous trajectory prediction. The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior of pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous traffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on extra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such labels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different behaviors within the same class of agents. In this work, we introduce the behavioral pseudo-labels that effectively capture the behavior distributions of pedestrians and heterogeneous agents solely based on their motion features, significantly improving the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To implement the framework, we propose the Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network (BP-SGCN) that learns pseudo-labels and informs to a trajectory predictor. For optimization, we propose a cascaded training scheme, in which we first learn the pseudo-labels in an unsupervised manner, and then perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the labels in the direction of increasing the trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our pseudo-labels effectively model different behavior clusters and improve trajectory prediction. Our proposed BP-SGCN outperforms existing methods using both pedestrian (ETH/UCY, pedestrian-only SDD) and heterogeneous agent datasets (SDD, Argoverse 1).</p>

<p>Abstract: Extracting tables from documents is a critical task across various industries, especially on business documents like invoices and reports. Existing systems based on DEtection TRansformer (DETR) such as TAble TRansformer (TATR), offer solutions for Table Detection (TD) and Table Structure Recognition (TSR) but face challenges with diverse table formats and common errors like incorrect area detection and overlapping columns. This research introduces RAPTOR, a modular post-processing system designed to enhance state-of-the-art models for improved table extraction, particularly for product tables. RAPTOR addresses recurrent TD and TSR issues, improving both precision and structural predictions. For TD, we use DETR (trained on ICDAR 2019) and TATR (trained on PubTables-1M and FinTabNet), while TSR only relies on TATR. A Genetic Algorithm is incorporated to optimize RAPTOR's module parameters, using a private dataset of product tables to align with industrial needs. We evaluate our method on two private datasets of product tables, the public DOCILE dataset (which contains tables similar to our target product tables), and the ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2019 datasets. The results demonstrate that while our approach excels at product tables, it also maintains reasonable performance across diverse table formats. An ablation study further validates the contribution of each module in our system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Yang, Lisheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised deep learning usually faces more challenges in medical images than in natural images. Since annotations in medical images require the expertise of doctors and are more time-consuming and expensive. Thus, some researchers turn to unsupervised learning methods, which usually face inevitable performance drops. In addition, medical images may have been acquired at different medical centers with different scanners and under different image acquisition protocols, so the modalities of the medical images are often inconsistent. This modality difference (domain shift) also reduces the applicability of deep learning methods. In this regard, we propose an unsupervised crossmodality domain adaptation method based on image translation by transforming the source modality image with annotation into the unannotated target modality and using its annotation to achieve supervised learning of the target modality. In addition, the subtle differences between translated pseudo images and real images are overcome by self-training methods to further improve the task performance of deep learning. The proposed method showed mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD) of $0.8351 \pm 0.1152$ and $1.6712 \pm 2.1948$ for vestibular schwannoma (VS), $0.8098 \pm 0.0233$ and $0.2317 \pm 0.1577$ for cochlea on the VS and cochlea segmentation task of the Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA 2022) challenge validation phase leaderboard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yishuo Wang, Feng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing ocean front detection methods--including histogram-based variance analysis, Lyapunov exponent, gradient thresholding, and machine learning--suffer from critical limitations: discontinuous outputs, over-detection, reliance on single-threshold decisions, and lack of open-source implementations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Bayesian Front Detection and Tracking framework with Metric Space Analysis (BFDT-MSA). The framework introduces three innovations: (1) a Bayesian decision mechanism that integrates gradient priors and field operators to eliminate manual threshold sensitivity; (2) morphological refinement algorithms for merging fragmented fronts, deleting spurious rings, and thinning frontal zones to pixel-level accuracy; and (3) a novel metric space definition for temporal front tracking, enabling systematic analysis of front evolution. Validated on global SST data (2022--2024), BFDT-MSA reduces over-detection by $73\%$ compared to histogram-based methods while achieving superior intensity ($0.16^\circ$C/km), continuity, and spatiotemporal coherence. The open-source release bridges a critical gap in reproducible oceanographic research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueting Liu, Hanshi Wang, Yunfei Lei, Zhengjun Zha, Weiming Hu, Jin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving perception have revealed exceptional capabilities within structured environments dominated by vehicular traffic. However, current perception models exhibit significant limitations in semi-structured environments, where dynamic pedestrians with more diverse irregular movement and occlusion prevail. We attribute this shortcoming to the scarcity of high-quality datasets in semi-structured scenes, particularly concerning pedestrian perception and prediction. In this work, we present the multi-modal Pedestrian-Focused Scene Dataset(PFSD), rigorously annotated in semi-structured scenes with the format of nuScenes. PFSD provides comprehensive multi-modal data annotations with point cloud segmentation, detection, and object IDs for tracking. It encompasses over 130,000 pedestrian instances captured across various scenarios with varying densities, movement patterns, and occlusions. Furthermore, to demonstrate the importance of addressing the challenges posed by more diverse and complex semi-structured environments, we propose a novel Hybrid Multi-Scale Fusion Network (HMFN). Specifically, to detect pedestrians in densely populated and occluded scenarios, our method effectively captures and fuses multi-scale features using a meticulously designed hybrid framework that integrates sparse and vanilla convolutions. Extensive experiments on PFSD demonstrate that HMFN attains improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) over existing methods, thereby underscoring its efficacy in addressing the challenges of 3D pedestrian detection in complex semi-structured environments. Coding and benchmark are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqian Ni, Sicong Du, Zhenghua Hou, Chenming Wu, Sheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: To evaluate end-to-end autonomous driving systems, a simulation environment based on Novel View Synthesis (NVS) techniques is essential, which synthesizes photo-realistic images and point clouds from previously recorded sequences under new vehicle poses, particularly in cross-lane scenarios. Therefore, the development of a multi-lane dataset and benchmark is necessary. While recent synthetic scene-based NVS datasets have been prepared for cross-lane benchmarking, they still lack the realism of captured images and point clouds. To further assess the performance of existing methods based on NeRF and 3DGS, we present the first multi-lane dataset registering parallel scans specifically for novel driving view synthesis dataset derived from real-world scans, comprising 25 groups of associated sequences, including 16,000 front-view images, 64,000 surround-view images, and 16,000 LiDAR frames. All frames are labeled to differentiate moving objects from static elements. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing approaches in various testing scenarios at different lanes and distances. Additionally, our method provides the solution for solving and assessing the quality of multi-sensor poses for multi-modal data alignment for curating such a dataset in real-world. We plan to continually add new sequences to test the generalization of existing methods across different scenarios. The dataset is released publicly at the project page: https://nizqleo.github.io/paralane-dataset/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khayrul Islam, Ratul Paul, Shen Wang, Yuwen Zhao, Partho Adhikary, Qiying Li, Xiaochen Qin, Yaling Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Label-free cell classification is advantageous for supplying pristine cells for further use or examination, yet existing techniques frequently fall short in terms of specificity and speed. In this study, we address these limitations through the development of a novel machine learning framework, Multiplex Image Machine Learning (MIML). This architecture uniquely combines label-free cell images with biomechanical property data, harnessing the vast, often underutilized morphological information intrinsic to each cell. By integrating both types of data, our model offers a more holistic understanding of the cellular properties, utilizing morphological information typically discarded in traditional machine learning models. This approach has led to a remarkable 98.3\% accuracy in cell classification, a substantial improvement over models that only consider a single data type. MIML has been proven effective in classifying white blood cells and tumor cells, with potential for broader application due to its inherent flexibility and transfer learning capability. It's particularly effective for cells with similar morphology but distinct biomechanical properties. This innovative approach has significant implications across various fields, from advancing disease diagnostics to understanding cellular behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongran Yu, Xueyan Liu, Shirui Pan, Anchen Li, Bo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: A key objective in the field of artificial intelligence is to develop cognitive models that can exhibit human-like intellectual capabilities. One promising approach to achieving this is through neural-symbolic systems, which combine the strengths of deep learning and symbolic reasoning. However, current methodologies in this area face limitations in integration, generalization, and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a neural-symbolic framework based on statistical relational learning, referred to as NSF-SRL. This framework effectively integrates deep learning models with symbolic reasoning in a mutually beneficial manner.In NSF-SRL, the results of symbolic reasoning are utilized to refine and correct the predictions made by deep learning models, while deep learning models enhance the efficiency of the symbolic reasoning process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves high performance and exhibits effective generalization in supervised learning, weakly supervised and zero-shot learning tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a quantitative strategy to evaluate the interpretability of the model's predictions, visualizing the corresponding logic rules that contribute to these predictions and providing insights into the reasoning process. We believe that this approach sets a new standard for neural-symbolic systems and will drive future research in the field of general artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of interacting with open-world environments to solve diverse tasks is a compelling challenge. However, evaluating such open-ended agents remains difficult, with current benchmarks facing scalability limitations. To address this, we introduce Minecraft Universe (MCU), a comprehensive evaluation framework set within the open-world video game Minecraft. MCU incorporates three key components: (1) an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks that encompasses 11 major categories and 41 subcategories of challenges; (2) a task composition mechanism capable of generating infinite diverse tasks with varying difficulty; and (3) a general evaluation framework that achieves 91.5% alignment with human ratings for open-ended task assessment. Empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art foundation agents struggle with the increasing diversity and complexity of tasks. These findings highlight the necessity of MCU as a robust benchmark to drive progress in AI agent development within open-ended environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanran Chen, Yinpeng Dong, Shitong Shao, Zhongkai Hao, Xiao Yang, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative learning, recognized for its effective modeling of data distributions, offers inherent advantages in handling out-of-distribution instances, especially for enhancing robustness to adversarial attacks. Among these, diffusion classifiers, utilizing powerful diffusion models, have demonstrated superior empirical robustness. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of their robustness is still lacking, raising concerns about their vulnerability to stronger future attacks. In this study, we prove that diffusion classifiers possess $O(1)$ Lipschitzness, and establish their certified robustness, demonstrating their inherent resilience. To achieve non-constant Lipschitzness, thereby obtaining much tighter certified robustness, we generalize diffusion classifiers to classify Gaussian-corrupted data. This involves deriving the evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) for these distributions, approximating the likelihood using the ELBO, and calculating classification probabilities via Bayes' theorem. Experimental results show the superior certified robustness of these Noised Diffusion Classifiers (NDCs). Notably, we achieve over 80% and 70% certified robustness on CIFAR-10 under adversarial perturbations with \(\ell_2\) norms less than 0.25 and 0.5, respectively, using a single off-the-shelf diffusion model without any additional data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Hein, Grant Stevens, Adam Wang, Ge Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is widely used for medical diagnosis and treatment planning; however, concerns about ionizing radiation exposure drive efforts to optimize image quality at lower doses. This study introduces Poisson Flow Consistency Models (PFCM), a novel family of deep generative models that combines the robustness of PFGM++ with the efficient single-step sampling of consistency models. PFCM are derived by generalizing consistency distillation to PFGM++ through a change-of-variables and an updated noise distribution. As a distilled version of PFGM++, PFCM inherit the ability to trade off robustness for rigidity via the hyperparameter $D \in (0,\infty)$. A fact that we exploit to adapt this novel generative model for the task of low-dose CT image denoising, via a ``task-specific'' sampler that ``hijacks'' the generative process by replacing an intermediate state with the low-dose CT image. While this ``hijacking'' introduces a severe mismatch -- the noise characteristics of low-dose CT images are different from that of intermediate states in the Poisson flow process -- we show that the inherent robustness of PFCM at small $D$ effectively mitigates this issue. The resulting sampler achieves excellent performance in terms of LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR on the Mayo low-dose CT dataset. By contrast, an analogous sampler based on standard consistency models is found to be significantly less robust under the same conditions, highlighting the importance of a tunable $D$ afforded by our novel framework. To highlight generalizability, we show effective denoising of clinical images from a prototype photon-counting system reconstructed using a sharper kernel and at a range of energy levels.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can advanced multi-modal models effectively tackle complex web-based tasks? Such tasks are often found on crowdsourcing platforms, where crowdworkers engage in challenging micro-tasks within web-based environments.
  Building on this idea, we present TurkingBench, a benchmark consisting of tasks presented as web pages with textual instructions and multi-modal contexts. Unlike previous approaches that rely on artificially synthesized web pages, our benchmark uses natural HTML pages originally designed for crowdsourcing workers to perform various annotation tasks. Each task's HTML instructions are instantiated with different values derived from crowdsourcing tasks, creating diverse instances. This benchmark includes 32.2K instances spread across 158 tasks.
  To support the evaluation of TurkingBench, we have developed a framework that links chatbot responses to actions on web pages (e.g., modifying a text box, selecting a radio button). We assess the performance of cutting-edge private and open-source models, including language-only and vision-language models (such as GPT4 and InternVL), on this benchmark. Our results show that while these models outperform random chance, there is still significant room for improvement. We hope that this benchmark will drive progress in the evaluation and development of web-based agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianye Huang, Chenyang Li, Angelos Karlas, Xiangyu Chu, K. W. Samuel Au, Nassir Navab, Zhongliang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise percutaneous needle detection is crucial for ultrasound (US)-guided interventions. However, inherent limitations such as speckles, needle-like artifacts, and low resolution make it challenging to robustly detect needles, especially when their visibility is reduced or imperceptible. To address this challenge, we propose VibNet, a learning-based framework designed to enhance the robustness and accuracy of needle detection in US images by leveraging periodic vibration applied externally to the needle shafts. VibNet integrates neural Short-Time Fourier Transform and Hough Transform modules to achieve successive sub-goals, including motion feature extraction in the spatiotemporal space, frequency feature aggregation, and needle detection in the Hough space. Due to the periodic subtle vibration, the features are more robust in the frequency domain than in the image intensity domain, making VibNet more effective than traditional intensity-based methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VibNet, we conducted experiments on distinct \textit{ex vivo} porcine and bovine tissue samples. The results obtained on porcine samples demonstrate that VibNet effectively detects needles even when their visibility is severely reduced, with a tip error of $1.61\pm1.56~mm$ compared to $8.15\pm9.98~mm$ for UNet and $6.63\pm7.58~mm$ for WNet, and a needle direction error of $1.64\pm1.86^{\circ}$ compared to $9.29\pm15.30^{\circ}$ for UNet and $8.54\pm17.92^{\circ}$ for WNet.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasushi Esaki, Satoshi Koide, Takuro Kutsuna</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain incremental learning (DIL) has been discussed in previous studies on deep neural network models for classification. In DIL, we assume that samples on new domains are observed over time. The models must classify inputs on all domains. In practice, however, we may encounter a situation where we need to perform DIL under the constraint that the samples on the new domain are observed only infrequently. Therefore, in this study, we consider the extreme case where we have only one sample from the new domain, which we call one-shot DIL. We first empirically show that existing DIL methods do not work well in one-shot DIL. We have analyzed the reason for this failure through various investigations. According to our analysis, we clarify that the difficulty of one-shot DIL is caused by the statistics in the batch normalization layers. Therefore, we propose a technique regarding these statistics and demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through experiments on open datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabyasachi Sahoo, Mostafa ElAraby, Jonas Ngnawe, Yann Pequignot, Frederic Precioso, Christian Gagne</p>
<p>Abstract: Test Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses the problem of distribution shift by adapting a pretrained model to a new domain during inference. When faced with challenging shifts, most methods collapse and perform worse than the original pretrained model. In this paper, we find that not all layers are equally receptive to the adaptation, and the layers with the most misaligned gradients often cause performance degradation. To address this, we propose GALA, a novel layer selection criterion to identify the most beneficial updates to perform during test time adaptation. This criterion can also filter out unreliable samples with noisy gradients. Its simplicity allows seamless integration with existing TTA loss functions, thereby preventing degradation and focusing adaptation on the most trainable layers. This approach also helps to regularize adaptation to preserve the pretrained features, which are crucial for handling unseen domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed layer selection framework improves the performance of existing TTA approaches across multiple datasets, domain shifts, model architectures, and TTA losses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muyang Li, Can Cui, Quan Liu, Ruining Deng, Tianyuan Yao, Marilyn Lionts, Yuankai Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Data sharing in the medical image analysis field has potential yet remains underappreciated. The aim is often to share datasets efficiently with other sites to train models effectively. One possible solution is to avoid transferring the entire dataset while still achieving similar model performance. Recent progress in data distillation within computer science offers promising prospects for sharing medical data efficiently without significantly compromising model effectiveness. However, it remains uncertain whether these methods would be applicable to medical imaging, since medical and natural images are distinct fields. Moreover, it is intriguing to consider what level of performance could be achieved with these methods. To answer these questions, we conduct investigations on a variety of leading data distillation methods, in different contexts of medical imaging. We evaluate the feasibility of these methods with extensive experiments in two aspects: 1) Assess the impact of data distillation across multiple datasets characterized by minor or great variations. 2) Explore the indicator to predict the distillation performance. Our extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets reveal that data distillation can significantly reduce dataset size while maintaining comparable model performance to that achieved with the full dataset, suggesting that a small, representative sample of images can serve as a reliable indicator of distillation success. This study demonstrates that data distillation is a viable method for efficient and secure medical data sharing, with the potential to facilitate enhanced collaborative research and clinical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The use of commercial Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) has surged in the past decade, offering societal benefits but also raising risks such as airspace violations and privacy concerns. Due to the increased security risks, the development of autonomous drone detection and tracking systems has become a priority. In this study, we tackle this challenge, by using non-repetitive rosette scanning pattern LiDARs, particularly focusing on increasing the detection distance by leveraging the characteristics of the sensor. The presented method utilizes a particle filter with a velocity component for the detection and tracking of the drone, which offers added re-detection capability. A Pan-Tilt platform is utilized to take advantage of the specific characteristics of the rosette scanning pattern LiDAR by keeping the tracked object in the center where the measurement is most dense. The detection capabilities and accuracy of the system are validated through indoor experiments, while the maximum detection distance is shown in our outdoor experiments. Our approach achieved accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art indoor method while increasing the maximum detection range by approximately 80\% beyond the state-of-the-art outdoor method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eui Jun Hwang, Sukmin Cho, Junmyeong Lee, Jong C. Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) converts sign videos directly into spoken language sentences without relying on glosses. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable translation performance in gloss-free methods by harnessing their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these methods often rely on domain-specific fine-tuning of visual encoders to achieve optimal results. By contrast, this paper emphasizes the importance of capturing the spatial configurations and motion dynamics inherent in sign language. With this in mind, we introduce Spatial and Motion-based Sign Language Translation (SpaMo), a novel LLM-based SLT framework. The core idea of SpaMo is simple yet effective. We first extract spatial and motion features using off-the-shelf visual encoders and then input these features into an LLM with a language prompt. Additionally, we employ a visual-text alignment process as a warm-up before the SLT supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that SpaMo achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Zhou, Mingsi Wang, Tianlin Li, Guozhu Meng, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Pose-driven human image animation has achieved tremendous progress, enabling the generation of vivid and realistic human videos from just one single photo. However, it conversely exacerbates the risk of image misuse, as attackers may use one available image to create videos involving politics, violence, and other illegal content. To counter this threat, we propose Dormant, a novel protection approach tailored to defend against pose-driven human image animation techniques. Dormant applies protective perturbation to one human image, preserving the visual similarity to the original but resulting in poor-quality video generation. The protective perturbation is optimized to induce misextraction of appearance features from the image and create incoherence among the generated video frames. Our extensive evaluation across 8 animation methods and 4 datasets demonstrates the superiority of Dormant over 6 baseline protection methods, leading to misaligned identities, visual distortions, noticeable artifacts, and inconsistent frames in the generated videos. Moreover, Dormant shows effectiveness on 6 real-world commercial services, even with fully black-box access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fernando P\'erez-Bueno, Hongwei Bran Li, Matthew S. Rosen, Shahin Nasr, Cesar Caballero-Gaudes, Juan Eugenio Iglesias</p>
<p>Abstract: While functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) offers valuable insights into cognitive processes, its inherent spatial limitations pose challenges for detailed analysis of the fine-grained functional architecture of the brain. More specifically, MRI scanner and sequence specifications impose a trade-off between temporal resolution, spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and scan time. Deep Learning (DL) Super-Resolution (SR) methods have emerged as a promising solution to enhance fMRI resolution, generating high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) images typically acquired with lower scanning times. However, most existing SR approaches depend on supervised DL techniques, which require training ground truth (GT) HR data, which is often difficult to acquire and simultaneously sets a bound for how far SR can go. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised DL SR model that combines a DL network with an analytical approach and Total Variation (TV) regularization. Our method eliminates the need for external GT images, achieving competitive performance compared to supervised DL techniques and preserving the functional maps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Wang, Xiang Chen, Ningyu Zhang, Bozhong Tian, Haoming Xu, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, but the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly generate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize visual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to the strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual information, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel dynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs DeCo, which adaptively selects the appropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and applied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared to baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng-Chieh Lin, Chankyu Lee, Mohammad Shoeybi, Jimmy Lin, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search scenario, in which retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer a specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries and retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but it underperforms compared to a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to the modality bias exhibited by MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose continuously fine-tuning the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while preserving multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on the MTEB retrieval benchmark. We also explore prompting the off-the-shelf MLLMs as zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that, through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way for advancing universal multimodal retrieval in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Garg, Trilok Padhi, Hemang Jain, Ugur Kursuncu, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</p>
<p>Abstract: Toxicity identification in online multimodal environments remains a challenging task due to the complexity of contextual connections across modalities (e.g., textual and visual). In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) from Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) and knowledge infusion to enhance the performance of toxicity detection in hateful memes. Our approach extracts sub-knowledge graphs from ConceptNet, a large-scale commonsense Knowledge Graph (KG) to be infused within a compact VLM framework. The relational context between toxic phrases in captions and memes, as well as visual concepts in memes enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Experimental results from our study on two hate speech benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines across AU-ROC, F1, and Recall with improvements of 1.1%, 7%, and 35%, respectively. Given the contextual complexity of the toxicity detection task, our approach showcases the significance of learning from both explicit (i.e. KG) as well as implicit (i.e. LVLMs) contextual cues incorporated through a hybrid neurosymbolic approach. This is crucial for real-world applications where accurate and scalable recognition of toxic content is critical for creating safer online environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiwei Liu, Mohamad Kassab, Min Xu, Qirong Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryo-Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET) enables detailed 3D visualization of cellular structures in near-native states but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio due to imaging constraints. Traditional denoising methods and supervised learning approaches often struggle with complex noise patterns and the lack of paired datasets. Self-supervised methods, which utilize noisy input itself as a target, have been studied; however, existing Cryo-ET self-supervised denoising methods face significant challenges due to losing information during training and the learned incomplete noise patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning model that denoises Cryo-ET volumetric images using a single noisy volume. Our method features a U-shape J-invariant blind spot network with sparse centrally masked convolutions, dilated channel attention blocks, and volume unshuffle/shuffle technique. The volume-unshuffle/shuffle technique expands receptive fields and utilizes multi-scale representations, significantly improving noise reduction and structural preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, advancing Cryo-ET data processing for structural biology research</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harshvivek Kashid, Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology has revolutionized the digitization of printed text, enabling efficient data extraction and analysis across various domains. Just like Machine Translation systems, OCR systems are prone to errors. In this work, we address the challenge of data generation and post-OCR error correction, specifically for low-resource languages. We propose an approach for synthetic data generation for Devanagari languages, RoundTripOCR, that tackles the scarcity of the post-OCR Error Correction datasets for low-resource languages. We release post-OCR text correction datasets for Hindi, Marathi, Bodo, Nepali, Konkani and Sanskrit. We also present a novel approach for OCR error correction by leveraging techniques from machine translation. Our method involves translating erroneous OCR output into a corrected form by treating the OCR errors as mistranslations in a parallel text corpus, employing pre-trained transformer models to learn the mapping from erroneous to correct text pairs, effectively correcting OCR errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Supriya Manna, Niladri Sett</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning's preponderance across scientific domains has reshaped high-stakes decision-making, making it essential to follow rigorous operational frameworks that include both Right-to-Privacy (RTP) and Right-to-Explanation (RTE). This paper examines the complexities of combining these two requirements. For RTP, we focus on `Differential privacy' (DP), which is considered the current \textit{gold standard} for privacy-preserving machine learning due to its strong quantitative guarantee of privacy. For RTE, we focus on post-hoc explainers: they are the \textit{go-to} option for model auditing as they operate independently of model training. We formally investigate DP models and various commonly-used post-hoc explainers: how to evaluate these explainers subject to RTP, and analyze the intrinsic interactions between DP models and these explainers. Furthermore, our work throws light on how RTP and RTE can be effectively combined in high-stakes applications. Our study concludes by outlining an industrial software pipeline, with the example of a wildly used use-case, that respects both RTP and RTE requirements.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04561">OpenOmni: Advancing Open-Source Omnimodal Large Language Models with Progressive Multimodal Alignment and Real-Time Self-Aware Emotional Speech Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Run Luo, Ting-En Lin, Haonan Zhang, Yuchuan Wu, Xiong Liu, Min Yang, Yongbin Li, Longze Chen, Jiaming Li, Lei Zhang, Yangyi Chen, Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Fei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in omnimodal learning have significantly improved understanding and generation across images, text, and speech, yet these developments remain predominantly confined to proprietary models. The lack of high-quality omnimodal datasets and the challenges of real-time emotional speech synthesis have notably hindered progress in open-source research. To address these limitations, we introduce \name, a two-stage training framework that integrates omnimodal alignment and speech generation to develop a state-of-the-art omnimodal large language model. In the alignment phase, a pre-trained speech model undergoes further training on text-image tasks, enabling (near) zero-shot generalization from vision to speech, outperforming models trained on tri-modal datasets. In the speech generation phase, a lightweight decoder is trained on speech tasks with direct preference optimization, enabling real-time emotional speech synthesis with high fidelity. Experiments show that \name surpasses state-of-the-art models across omnimodal, vision-language, and speech-language benchmarks. It achieves a 4-point absolute improvement on OmniBench over the leading open-source model VITA, despite using 5x fewer training samples and a smaller model size (7B vs. 7x8B). Additionally, \name achieves real-time speech generation with <1s latency at non-autoregressive mode, reducing inference time by 5x compared to autoregressive methods, and improves emotion classification accuracy by 7.7\%</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Tourani, Deniz Isinsu Avsar, Hriday Bavle, Jose Luis Sanchez-Lopez, Jan Lagerwall, Holger Voos</p>
<p>Abstract: Fiducial markers are widely used in various robotics tasks, facilitating enhanced navigation, object recognition, and scene understanding. Despite their advantages for robots and Augmented Reality (AR) applications, they often disrupt the visual aesthetics of environments because they are visible to humans, making them unsuitable for non-intrusive use cases. To address this gap, this paper presents "iMarkers"-innovative, unobtrusive fiducial markers detectable exclusively by robots equipped with specialized sensors. These markers offer high flexibility in production, allowing customization of their visibility range and encoding algorithms to suit various demands. The paper also introduces the hardware designs and software algorithms developed for detecting iMarkers, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in the detection and recognition stages. Various evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of iMarkers compared to conventional (printed) and blended fiducial markers and confirmed their applicability in diverse robotics scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Guande He, Jianfei Chen, Fan Bao, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistency distillation is a prevalent way for accelerating diffusion models adopted in consistency (trajectory) models, in which a student model is trained to traverse backward on the probability flow (PF) ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory determined by the teacher model. Preconditioning is a vital technique for stabilizing consistency distillation, by linear combining the input data and the network output with pre-defined coefficients as the consistency function. It imposes the boundary condition of consistency functions without restricting the form and expressiveness of the neural network. However, previous preconditionings are hand-crafted and may be suboptimal choices. In this work, we offer the first theoretical insights into the preconditioning in consistency distillation, by elucidating its design criteria and the connection to the teacher ODE trajectory. Based on these analyses, we further propose a principled way dubbed \textit{Analytic-Precond} to analytically optimize the preconditioning according to the consistency gap (defined as the gap between the teacher denoiser and the optimal student denoiser) on a generalized teacher ODE. We demonstrate that Analytic-Precond can facilitate the learning of trajectory jumpers, enhance the alignment of the student trajectory with the teacher's, and achieve $2\times$ to $3\times$ training acceleration of consistency trajectory models in multi-step generation across various datasets.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05451">Inversion of Magnetic Data using Learned Dictionaries and Scale Space</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shadab Ahamed, Simon Ghyselincks, Pablo Chang Huang Arias, Julian Kloiber, Yasin Ranjbar, Jingrong Tang, Niloufar Zakariaei, Eldad Haber</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic data inversion is an important tool in geophysics, used to infer subsurface magnetic susceptibility distributions from surface magnetic field measurements. This inverse problem is inherently ill-posed, characterized by non-unique solutions, depth ambiguity, and sensitivity to noise. Traditional inversion approaches rely on predefined regularization techniques to stabilize solutions, limiting their adaptability to complex or diverse geological scenarios. In this study, we propose an approach that integrates variable dictionary learning and scale-space methods to address these challenges. Our method employs learned dictionaries, allowing for adaptive representation of complex subsurface features that are difficult to capture with predefined bases. Additionally, we extend classical variational inversion by incorporating multi-scale representations through a scale-space framework, enabling the progressive introduction of structural detail while mitigating overfitting. We implement both fixed and dynamic dictionary learning techniques, with the latter introducing iteration-dependent dictionaries for enhanced flexibility. Using a synthetic dataset to simulate geological scenarios, we demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to conventional variational and dictionary-based methods. Our results highlight the potential of learned dictionaries, especially when coupled with scale-space dynamics, to improve model recovery and noise handling. These findings underscore the promise of our data-driven approach for advance magnetic data inversion and its applications in geophysical exploration, environmental assessment, and mineral prospecting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Yang, Hanyang Chen, Junyu Zhang, Mark Zhao, Cheng Qian, Kangrui Wang, Qineng Wang, Teja Venkat Koripella, Marziyeh Movahedi, Manling Li, Heng Ji, Huan Zhang, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create embodied agents offers a promising avenue for tackling real-world tasks. While language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention, MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmbodiedBench, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate vision-driven embodied agents. EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 19 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gokul Karthik Kumar, Iheb Chaabane, Kebin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in various visual benchmarks but are often constrained by the lack of high-quality visual fine-tuning data. To address this challenge, we introduce VisCon-100K, a novel dataset derived from interleaved image-text web documents. Our approach transforms 45K web documents from the OBELICS dataset into 100K image conversation samples. We utilize GPT-4V to generate image-contextual captions and OpenChat 3.5 model to convert these captions into diverse free-form and multiple-choice question-answer pairs. Integrating this dataset for fine-tuning considerably enhances VLM performance across multiple benchmarks. Unlike methods that focus solely on fine-grained visual content, our approach leverages accompanying web context, yielding superior results. We also discover that a 'leaky modality mix', where conversation samples contain questions answerable from both the image and its contextual caption, outperforms non-leaky combinations of captions and Q&A pairs. VisCon-100k dataset shows strong performance with two popular VLM approaches: text-only large language model (LLM) aligned with a vision encoder using image captions data (ShareGPT4V-7b) and multimodally pretrained LLM (IDEFICS2-8b) using interleaved image-text data. In addition to releasing the VisCon-100K dataset, we provide a contextual captioner trained on this dataset, facilitating scalable fine-tuning data generation for future research and open-source applications. Using the same pipeline, but substituting our trained contextual captioner for GPT-4V, we also release the larger VisCon-1M dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Yang, Taizhang Shang, Weixuan Sun, Xibin Song, Ziang Cheng, Senbo Wang, Shenzhou Chen, Weizhe Liu, Hongdong Li, Pan Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive framework for generating high-quality 3D shapes and textures from diverse input prompts, including single images, multi-view images, and text descriptions. The framework consists of 3D shape generation and texture generation. (1). The 3D shape generation pipeline employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode implicit 3D geometries into a latent space and a diffusion network to generate latents conditioned on input prompts, with modifications to enhance model capacity. An alternative Artist-Created Mesh (AM) generation approach is also explored, yielding promising results for simpler geometries. (2). Texture generation involves a multi-stage process starting with frontal images generation followed by multi-view images generation, RGB-to-PBR texture conversion, and high-resolution multi-view texture refinement. A consistency scheduler is plugged into every stage, to enforce pixel-wise consistency among multi-view textures during inference, ensuring seamless integration.
  The pipeline demonstrates effective handling of diverse input formats, leveraging advanced neural architectures and novel methodologies to produce high-quality 3D content. This report details the system architecture, experimental results, and potential future directions to improve and expand the framework.
