<p><b>Authors:</b> Si-Ioi Ng, Pranav S. Ambadi, Kimberly D. Mueller, Julie Liss, Visar Berisha</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods for analyzing linguistic content from picture descriptions for assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment often overlook the participant's visual narrative path, which typically requires eye tracking to assess. Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juno Kim, Denny Wu, Jason Lee, Taiji Suzuki</p>
<p>Abstract: A key paradigm to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is to allocate more inference-time compute to search against a verifier or reward model. This process can then be utilized to refine the pretrained model or distill its reasoning patterns into more efficient models. In this paper, we study inference-time compute by viewing chain-of-thought (CoT) generation as a metastable Markov process: easy reasoning steps (e.g., algebraic manipulations) form densely connected clusters, while hard reasoning steps (e.g., applying a relevant theorem) create sparse, low-probability edges between clusters, leading to phase transitions at longer timescales. Under this framework, we prove that implementing a search protocol that rewards sparse edges improves CoT by decreasing the expected number of steps to reach different clusters. In contrast, we establish a limit on reasoning capability when the model is restricted to local information of the pretrained graph. We also show that the information gained by search can be utilized to obtain a better reasoning model: (1) the pretrained model can be directly finetuned to favor sparse edges via policy gradient methods, and moreover (2) a compressed metastable representation of the reasoning dynamics can be distilled into a smaller, more efficient model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazi Tian, Liqin Wang, Pedram Fard, Valdery Moura Junior, Deborah Blacker, Jennifer S. Haas, Chirag Patel, Shawn N. Murphy, Lidia M. V. R. Moura, Hossein Estiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Early identification of cognitive concerns is critical but often hindered by subtle symptom presentation. This study developed and validated a fully automated, multi-agent AI workflow using LLaMA 3 8B to identify cognitive concerns in 3,338 clinical notes from Mass General Brigham. The agentic workflow, leveraging task-specific agents that dynamically collaborate to extract meaningful insights from clinical notes, was compared to an expert-driven benchmark. Both workflows achieved high classification performance, with F1-scores of 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. The agentic workflow demonstrated improved specificity (1.00) and achieved prompt refinement in fewer iterations. Although both workflows showed reduced performance on validation data, the agentic workflow maintained perfect specificity. These findings highlight the potential of fully automated multi-agent AI workflows to achieve expert-level accuracy with greater efficiency, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for detecting cognitive concerns in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saad Alqithami</p>
<p>Abstract: Addressing global challenges such as greenhouse gas emissions and resource inequity demands advanced AI-driven coordination among autonomous agents. We propose CH-MARL (Constrained Hierarchical Multiagent Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that integrates hierarchical decision-making with dynamic constraint enforcement and fairness-aware reward shaping. CH-MARL employs a real-time constraint-enforcement layer to ensure adherence to global emission caps, while incorporating fairness metrics that promote equitable resource distribution among agents. Experiments conducted in a simulated maritime logistics environment demonstrate considerable reductions in emissions, along with improvements in fairness and operational efficiency. Beyond this domain-specific success, CH-MARL provides a scalable, generalizable solution to multi-agent coordination challenges in constrained, dynamic settings, thus advancing the state of the art in reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngsung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks, as currently designed, fall short of achieving true logical intelligence. Modern AI models rely on standard neural computation-inner-product-based transformations and nonlinear activations-to approximate patterns from data. While effective for inductive learning, this architecture lacks the structural guarantees necessary for deductive inference and logical consistency. As a result, deep networks struggle with rule-based reasoning, structured generalization, and interpretability without extensive post-hoc modifications. This position paper argues that standard neural layers must be fundamentally rethought to integrate logical reasoning. We advocate for Logical Neural Units (LNUs)-modular components that embed differentiable approximations of logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, NOT) directly within neural architectures. We critique existing neurosymbolic approaches, highlight the limitations of standard neural computation for logical inference, and present LNUs as a necessary paradigm shift in AI. Finally, we outline a roadmap for implementation, discussing theoretical foundations, architectural integration, and key challenges for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Gao, Mattia Piccinini, Johannes Betz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can capture nuanced contextual relationships, reasoning, and complex problem-solving. By leveraging their ability to process and interpret large-scale information, LLMs have shown potential to address domain-specific challenges, including those in autonomous driving systems. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages LLMs for risk-aware analysis of generated driving scenarios. We hypothesize that LLMs can effectively evaluate whether driving scenarios generated by autonomous driving testing simulators are safety-critical. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted an empirical evaluation to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in performing this task. This framework will also provide feedback to generate the new safety-critical scenario by using adversarial method to modify existing non-critical scenarios and test their effectiveness in validating motion planning algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thien Q. Tran, Akifumi Wachi, Rei Sato, Takumi Tanabe, Youhei Akimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety alignment is an essential research topic for real-world AI applications. Despite the multifaceted nature of safety and trustworthiness in AI, current safety alignment methods often focus on a comprehensive notion of safety. By carefully assessing models from the existing safety-alignment methods, we found that, while they generally improved overall safety performance, they failed to ensure safety in specific categories. Our study first identified the difficulty of eliminating such vulnerabilities without sacrificing the model's helpfulness. We observed that, while smaller KL penalty parameters, increased training iterations, and dataset cleansing can enhance safety, they do not necessarily improve the trade-off between safety and helpfulness. We discovered that safety alignment could even induce undesired effects and result in a model that prefers generating negative tokens leading to rejective responses, regardless of the input context. To address this, we introduced a learning-free method, Token-level Safety-Debiased Inference (TSDI), to estimate and correct this bias during the generation process using randomly constructed prompts. Our experiments demonstrated that our method could enhance the model's helpfulness while maintaining safety, thus improving the trade-off Pareto-front.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02180">The Elicitation Game: Evaluating Capability Elicitation Techniques</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Hofst\"atter, Teun van der Weij, Jayden Teoh, Henning Bartsch, Francis Rhys Ward</p>
<p>Abstract: Capability evaluations are required to understand and regulate AI systems that may be deployed or further developed. Therefore, it is important that evaluations provide an accurate estimation of an AI system's capabilities. However, in numerous cases, previously latent capabilities have been elicited from models, sometimes long after initial release. Accordingly, substantial efforts have been made to develop methods for eliciting latent capabilities from models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of capability elicitation techniques by intentionally training model organisms -- language models with hidden capabilities that are revealed by a password. We introduce a novel method for training model organisms, based on circuit breaking, which is more robust to elicitation techniques than standard password-locked models. We focus on elicitation techniques based on prompting and activation steering, and compare these to fine-tuning methods. Prompting techniques can elicit the actual capability of both password-locked and circuit-broken model organisms in an MCQA setting, while steering fails to do so. For a code-generation task, only fine-tuning can elicit the hidden capabilities of our novel model organism. Additionally, our results suggest that combining techniques improves elicitation. Still, if possible, fine-tuning should be the method of choice to improve the trustworthiness of capability evaluations.</p>

Unlike existing methods that assume a specific distribution over partners, our approach improves worst-case performance guarantees. Extensive experiments, including evaluations on coordinated cooking tasks from the Melting Pot suite, show our method's superior robustness compared to self-play, fictitious play, and best response learning. Our work highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate training distribution over teammates to achieve robustness in AHT.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02446">Towards graph neural networks for provably solving convex optimization problems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chendi Qian, Christopher Morris</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have shown potential for solving combinatorial and continuous optimization problems due to their ability to capture variable-constraint interactions. While existing approaches leverage MPNNs to approximate solutions or warm-start traditional solvers, they often lack guarantees for feasibility, particularly in convex optimization settings. Here, we propose an iterative MPNN framework to solve convex optimization problems with provable feasibility guarantees. First, we demonstrate that MPNNs can provably simulate standard interior-point methods for solving quadratic problems with linear constraints, covering relevant problems such as SVMs. Secondly, to ensure feasibility, we introduce a variant that starts from a feasible point and iteratively restricts the search within the feasible region. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing neural baselines in solution quality and feasibility, generalizes well to unseen problem sizes, and, in some cases, achieves faster solution times than state-of-the-art solvers such as Gurobi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ron Benchetrit, Idan Lev-Yehudi, Andrey Zhitnikov, Vadim Indelman</p>
<p>Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a robust framework for decision-making under uncertainty in applications such as autonomous driving and robotic exploration. Their extension, $\rho$POMDPs, introduces belief-dependent rewards, enabling explicit reasoning about uncertainty. Existing online $\rho$POMDP solvers for continuous spaces rely on fixed belief representations, limiting adaptability and refinement - critical for tasks such as information-gathering. We present $\rho$POMCPOW, an anytime solver that dynamically refines belief representations, with formal guarantees of improvement over time. To mitigate the high computational cost of updating belief-dependent rewards, we propose a novel incremental computation approach. We demonstrate its effectiveness for common entropy estimators, reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. Experimental results show that $\rho$POMCPOW outperforms state-of-the-art solvers in both efficiency and solution quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyan Xu, Wenjie Wang, Yang Zhang, Biao Tang, Peng Yan, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized content filtering, such as recommender systems, has become a critical infrastructure to alleviate information overload. However, these systems merely filter existing content and are constrained by its limited diversity, making it difficult to meet users' varied content needs. To address this limitation, personalized content generation has emerged as a promising direction with broad applications. Nevertheless, most existing research focuses on personalized text generation, with relatively little attention given to personalized image generation. The limited work in personalized image generation faces challenges in accurately capturing users' visual preferences and needs from noisy user-interacted images and complex multimodal instructions. Worse still, there is a lack of supervised data for training personalized image generation models.
  To overcome the challenges, we propose a Personalized Image Generation Framework named Pigeon, which adopts exceptional large multimodal models with three dedicated modules to capture users' visual preferences and needs from noisy user history and multimodal instructions. To alleviate the data scarcity, we introduce a two-stage preference alignment scheme, comprising masked preference reconstruction and pairwise preference alignment, to align Pigeon with the personalized image generation task. We apply Pigeon to personalized sticker and movie poster generation, where extensive quantitative results and human evaluation highlight its superiority over various generative baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the span of four decades, quantum computation has evolved from an intellectual curiosity to a potentially realizable technology. Today, small-scale demonstrations have become possible for quantum algorithmic primitives on hundreds of physical qubits and proof-of-principle error-correction on a single logical qubit. Nevertheless, despite significant progress and excitement, the path toward a full-stack scalable technology is largely unknown. There are significant outstanding quantum hardware, fabrication, software architecture, and algorithmic challenges that are either unresolved or overlooked. These issues could seriously undermine the arrival of utility-scale quantum computers for the foreseeable future. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of these scaling challenges. We show how the road to scaling could be paved by adopting existing semiconductor technology to build much higher-quality qubits, employing system engineering approaches, and performing distributed quantum computation within heterogeneous high-performance computing infrastructures. These opportunities for research and development could unlock certain promising applications, in particular, efficient quantum simulation/learning of quantum data generated by natural or engineered quantum systems. To estimate the true cost of such promises, we provide a detailed resource and sensitivity analysis for classically hard quantum chemistry calculations on surface-code error-corrected quantum computers given current, target, and desired hardware specifications based on superconducting qubits, accounting for a realistic distribution of errors. Furthermore, we argue that, to tackle industry-scale classical optimization and machine learning problems in a cost-effective manner, heterogeneous quantum-probabilistic computing with custom-designed accelerators should be considered as a complementary path toward scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines how social media algorithms and filter bubbles contribute to the fragmentation of online discourse, fostering ideological divides and undermining shared understanding. Drawing on Michael Sandels philosophical emphasis on community and shared values, the study explores how digital platforms amplify discrimination discourse including sexism, racism, xenophobia, ableism, homophobia, and religious intolerance during periods of heightened societal tension. By analyzing the dynamics of digital communities, the research highlights mechanisms driving the emergence and evolution of discourse fragments in response to real world events. The findings reveal how social media structures exacerbate polarization, restrict cross group dialogue, and erode the collective reasoning essential for a just society. This study situates philosophical perspectives within a computational analysis of social media interactions, offering a nuanced understanding of the challenges posed by fragmented discourse in the digital age.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Guerra-Manzanares, Farah E. Shamout</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal fusion leverages information across modalities to learn better feature representations with the goal of improving performance in fusion-based tasks. However, multimodal datasets, especially in medical settings, are typically smaller than their unimodal counterparts, which can impede the performance of multimodal models. Additionally, the increase in the number of modalities is often associated with an overall increase in the size of the multimodal network, which may be undesirable in medical use cases. Utilizing smaller unimodal encoders may lead to sub-optimal performance, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional clinical data. In this paper, we propose the Modality-INformed knowledge Distillation (MIND) framework, a multimodal model compression approach based on knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge from ensembles of pre-trained deep neural networks of varying sizes into a smaller multimodal student. The teacher models consist of unimodal networks, allowing the student to learn from diverse representations. MIND employs multi-head joint fusion models, as opposed to single-head models, enabling the use of unimodal encoders in the case of unimodal samples without requiring imputation or masking of absent modalities. As a result, MIND generates an optimized multimodal model, enhancing both multimodal and unimodal representations. It can also be leveraged to balance multimodal learning during training. We evaluate MIND on binary and multilabel clinical prediction tasks using time series data and chest X-ray images. Additionally, we assess the generalizability of the MIND framework on three non-medical multimodal multiclass datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MIND enhances the performance of the smaller multimodal network across all five tasks, as well as various fusion methods and multimodal architectures, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study aimed at optimizing Llama2 inference, a critical aspect of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). We evaluate various programming languages and frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Python, Mojo, C++, and Java, analyzing their performance in terms of speed, memory consumption, and ease of implementation through extensive benchmarking. Strengths and limitations of each approach are highlighted, along with proposed optimization strategies for parallel processing and hardware utilization. Furthermore, we investigate the Mojo SDK, a novel framework designed for large language model (LLM) inference on Apple Silicon, benchmarking its performance against implementations in C, C++, Rust, Zig, Go, and Julia. Our experiments, conducted on an Apple M1 Max, demonstrate Mojo SDK's competitive performance, ease of use, and seamless Python compatibility, positioning it as a strong alternative for LLM inference on Apple Silicon. We also discuss broader implications for LLM deployment on resource-constrained hardware and identify potential directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soham Sane</p>
<p>Abstract: Hybrid Group Relative Policy Optimization (Hybrid GRPO) is a reinforcement learning framework that extends Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by incorporating empirical multi-sample action evaluation while preserving the stability of value function-based learning. Unlike DeepSeek GRPO, which eliminates the value function in favor of purely empirical reward estimation, Hybrid GRPO introduces a structured advantage computation method that balances empirical action sampling with bootstrapped value estimation. This approach enhances sample efficiency, improves learning stability, and mitigates variance amplification observed in purely empirical methods. A detailed mathematical comparison between PPO, DeepSeek GRPO, and Hybrid GRPO is presented, highlighting key differences in advantage estimation and policy updates. Experimental validation in a controlled reinforcement learning environment demonstrates that Hybrid GRPO achieves superior convergence speed, more stable policy updates, and improved sample efficiency compared to existing methods. Several extensions to Hybrid GRPO are explored, including entropy-regularized sampling, hierarchical multi-step sub-sampling, adaptive reward normalization, and value-based action selection. Beyond reinforcement learning in simulated environments, Hybrid GRPO provides a scalable framework for bridging the gap between large language models (LLMs) and real-world agent-based decision-making. By integrating structured empirical sampling with reinforcement learning stability mechanisms, Hybrid GRPO has potential applications in autonomous robotics, financial modeling, and AI-driven control systems. These findings suggest that Hybrid GRPO serves as a robust and adaptable reinforcement learning methodology, paving the way for further advancements in policy optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyan Li, Yaoyang Wu, Simon Fong, Antonio J. Tall\'on-Ballesteros, Xin-she Yang, Sabah Mohammed, Feng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensemble technique and under-sampling technique are both effective tools used for imbalanced dataset classification problems. In this paper, a novel ensemble method combining the advantages of both ensemble learning for biasing classifiers and a new under-sampling method is proposed. The under-sampling method is named Binary PSO instance selection; it gathers with ensemble classifiers to find the most suitable length and combination of the majority class samples to build a new dataset with minority class samples. The proposed method adopts multi-objective strategy, and contribution of this method is a notable improvement of the performances of imbalanced classification, and in the meantime guaranteeing a best integrity possible for the original dataset. We experimented the proposed method and compared its performance of processing imbalanced datasets with several other conventional basic ensemble methods. Experiment is also conducted on these imbalanced datasets using an improved version where ensemble classifiers are wrapped in the Binary PSO instance selection. According to experimental results, our proposed methods outperform single ensemble methods, state-of-the-art under-sampling methods, and also combinations of these methods with the traditional PSO instance selection algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varun Dhanraj, Chris Eliasmith</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to face challenges in reliably solving reasoning tasks, particularly tasks that involve precise rule following, as often found in mathematical reasoning tasks. This paper introduces a novel neurosymbolic method that improves LLM reasoning by encoding hidden states into neurosymbolic vectors, allowing for problem-solving within a neurosymbolic vector space. The results are decoded and combined with the original hidden state, boosting the model's performance on numerical reasoning tasks. By offloading computation through neurosymbolic representations, this method improves efficiency, reliability, and interpretability. Our experimental results demonstrate an average of $82.86\%$ lower cross entropy loss and $24.50$ times more problems correctly solved on a suite of mathematical reasoning problems compared to chain-of-thought prompting and supervised fine-tuning (LoRA), while at the same time not hindering the performance of the LLM on other tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Tomczak, Sanmukh Kuppannagari</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated great success in numerous domains including natural language processing and bioinformatics. This success stems from the use of the attention mechanism by these models in order to represent and propagate pairwise interactions between individual tokens of sequential data. However, the primary limitation of this operation is its quadratic memory and time complexity in relation to the input's context length - the length of a sequence over which the interactions need to be captured. This significantly limits the length of sequences that can be inferred upon by these models. Extensive research has been conducted to reduce the number of pairwise interactions to sub-quadratic in relation to the context length by introducing sparsity into the attention mechanism through the development of sparse attention masks. However, efficient implementations that achieve "true sparsity" are lacking.
  In this work, we address this issue by proposing a graph computing view of attention where tokens are perceived as nodes of the graph and the attention mask determines the edges of the graph. Using this view, we develop graph processing algorithms to implement the attention mechanism. Both theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms only perform the needed computations, i.e., they are work optimal. We also perform extensive experimentation using popular attention masks to explore the impact of sparsity on execution time and achievable context length. Our experiments demonstrate significant speedups in execution times compared to state-of-the-art attention implementations such as FlashAttention for large sequence lengths. We also demonstrate that our algorithms are able to achieve extremely long sequence lengths of as high as 160 million on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU (SXM4 80GB).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Liu (Deakin University), Yong Ge (The University of Arizona)</p>
<p>Abstract: Employee turnover refers to an individual's termination of employment from the current organization. It is one of the most persistent challenges for firms, especially those ones in Information Technology (IT) industry that confront high turnover rates. Effective prediction of potential employee turnovers benefits multiple stakeholders such as firms and online recruiters. Prior studies have focused on either the turnover prediction within a single firm or the aggregated employee movement among firms. How to predict the individual employees' turnovers among multiple firms has gained little attention in literature, and thus remains a great research challenge. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning approach based on job embeddedness theory to predict the turnovers of individual employees across different firms. Through extensive experimental evaluations using a real-world dataset, our developed method demonstrates superior performance over several state-of-the-art benchmark methods. Additionally, we estimate the cost saving for recruiters by using our turnover prediction solution and interpret the attributions of various driving factors to employee's turnover to showcase its practical business value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Fu, Yuchu Jiang, Junkai Chen, Jiaming Fan, Xin Geng, Xu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensemble methods enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining multiple models but suffer from high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce Speculative Ensemble, a novel framework that accelerates LLM ensembles without sacrificing performance, inspired by Speculative Decoding-where a small proposal model generates tokens sequentially, and a larger target model verifies them in parallel. Our approach builds on two key insights: (1) the verification distribution can be the ensemble distribution of both the proposal and target models, and (2) alternating each model as the proposer and verifier can further enhance efficiency. We generalize this method to ensembles with n models and theoretically prove that SE is never slower than a standard ensemble, typically achieving faster speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate speed improvements of 1.11x-2.23x over standard ensemble techniques without compromising generation quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Ren, Yuhang Zhang, Dongrui Liu, Xiaopeng Zhang, Qi Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) has shown success in aligning diffusion models with human preference. Previous approaches typically assume a consistent preference label between final generations and noisy samples at intermediate steps, and directly apply DPO to these noisy samples for fine-tuning. However, we theoretically identify inherent issues in this assumption and its impacts on the effectiveness of preference alignment. We first demonstrate the inherent issues from two perspectives: gradient direction and preference order, and then propose a Tailored Preference Optimization (TailorPO) framework for aligning diffusion models with human preference, underpinned by some theoretical insights. Our approach directly ranks intermediate noisy samples based on their step-wise reward, and effectively resolves the gradient direction issues through a simple yet efficient design. Additionally, we incorporate the gradient guidance of diffusion models into preference alignment to further enhance the optimization effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the model's ability to generate aesthetically pleasing and human-preferred images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenlu Ding, Jiancan Wu, Yancheng Yuan, Junfeng Fang, Cunchun Li, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of online digital advertising, conversion rate (CVR) prediction plays a pivotal role in maximizing revenue under cost-per-conversion (CPA) models, where advertisers are charged only when users complete specific actions, such as making a purchase. A major challenge in CVR prediction lies in the delayed feedback problem-conversions may occur hours or even weeks after initial user interactions. This delay complicates model training, as recent data may be incomplete, leading to biases and diminished performance. Although existing methods attempt to address this issue, they often fall short in adapting to evolving user behaviors and depend on auxiliary models, which introduces computational inefficiencies and the risk of model inconsistency. In this work, we propose an Influence Function-empowered framework for Delayed Feedback Modeling (IF-DFM). IF-DFM leverages influence functions to estimate how newly acquired and delayed conversion data impact model parameters, enabling efficient parameter updates without the need for full retraining. Additionally, we present a scalable algorithm that efficiently computes parameter updates by reframing the inverse Hessian-vector product as an optimization problem, striking a balance between computational efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that IF-DFM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing both prediction accuracy and model adaptability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Specialized hardware accelerators aid the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), and their efficiency impacts AI's environmental sustainability. This study presents the first publication of a comprehensive AI accelerator life-cycle assessment (LCA) of greenhouse gas emissions, including the first publication of manufacturing emissions of an AI accelerator.
  Our analysis of five Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) encompasses all stages of the hardware lifespan - from raw material extraction, manufacturing, and disposal, to energy consumption during development, deployment, and serving of AI models. Using first-party data, it offers the most comprehensive evaluation to date of AI hardware's environmental impact. We include detailed descriptions of our LCA to act as a tutorial, road map, and inspiration for other computer engineers to perform similar LCAs to help us all understand the environmental impacts of our chips and of AI.
  A byproduct of this study is the new metric compute carbon intensity (CCI) that is helpful in evaluating AI hardware sustainability and in estimating the carbon footprint of training and inference. This study shows that CCI improves 3x from TPU v4i to TPU v6e.
  Moreover, while this paper's focus is on hardware, software advancements leverage and amplify these gains.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Doubly Robust Monte Carlo Tree Search (DR-MCTS), a novel algorithm that integrates Doubly Robust (DR) off-policy estimation into Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance sample efficiency and decision quality in complex environments. Our approach introduces a hybrid estimator that combines MCTS rollouts with DR estimation, offering theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and variance reduction under specified conditions. Empirical evaluations in Tic-Tac-Toe and the partially observable VirtualHome environment demonstrate DR-MCTS's superior performance over standard MCTS. In Tic-Tac-Toe, DR-MCTS achieves an 88% win rate compared to a 10% win rate for standard MCTS. In compound VirtualHome tasks, DR-MCTS attains a 20.7% success rate versus 10.3% for standard MCTS. Our scaling analysis reveals that DR-MCTS exhibits better sample efficiency, notably outperforming standard MCTS with larger language models while using a smaller model. These results underscore DR-MCTS's potential for efficient decision-making in complex, real-world scenarios where sample efficiency is paramount.</p>

<p>Abstract: The diversity and complexity of Indic languages present unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in the domain of question answering (QA).To address these challenges, this paper explores the application of State Space Models (SSMs),to build efficient and contextually aware QA systems tailored for Indic languages. SSMs are particularly suited for this task due to their ability to model long-term and short-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-equipped to handle the rich morphology, complex syntax, and contextual intricacies characteristic of Indian languages. We evaluated multiple SSM architectures across diverse datasets representing various Indic languages and conducted a comparative analysis of their performance. Our results demonstrate that these models effectively capture linguistic subtleties, leading to significant improvements in question interpretation, context alignment, and answer generation. This work represents the first application of SSMs to question answering tasks in Indic languages, establishing a foundational benchmark for future research in this domain. We propose enhancements to existing SSM frameworks, optimizing their applicability to low-resource settings and multilingual scenarios prevalent in Indic languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Pezone</p>
<p>Abstract: As digital technologies advance, communication networks face challenges in handling the vast data generated by intelligent devices. Autonomous vehicles, smart sensors, and IoT systems necessitate new paradigms. This thesis addresses these challenges by integrating semantic communication and generative models for optimized image compression and edge network resource allocation. Unlike bit-centric systems, semantic communication prioritizes transmitting meaningful data specifically selected to convey the meaning rather than obtain a faithful representation of the original data. The communication infrastructure can benefit to significant improvements in bandwidth efficiency and latency reduction. Central to this work is the design of semantic-preserving image compression using Generative Adversarial Networks and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. These models compress images by encoding only semantically relevant features, allowing for high-quality reconstruction with minimal transmission. Additionally, a Goal-Oriented edge network optimization framework is introduced, leveraging the Information Bottleneck principle and stochastic optimization to dynamically allocate resources and enhance efficiency. By integrating semantic communication into edge networks, this approach balances computational efficiency and communication effectiveness, making it suitable for real-time applications. The thesis compares semantic-aware models with conventional image compression techniques using classical and semantic evaluation metrics. Results demonstrate the potential of combining generative AI and semantic communication to create more efficient semantic-goal-oriented communication networks that meet the demands of modern data-driven applications.</p>

This position paper presents a holistic framework for AI scaling, encompassing Scaling Up, Scaling Down, and Scaling Out.

These paradigms address critical technical and societal challenges, such as reducing carbon footprint, ensuring equitable access, and enhancing cross-domain collaboration. We explore transformative applications in healthcare, smart manufacturing, and content creation, demonstrating how AI Scaling can enable breakthroughs in efficiency, personalization, and global connectivity. Additionally, we highlight key challenges, including balancing model complexity with interpretability, managing resource constraints, and fostering ethical development.

<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective solution for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection. However, existing methods, whether based on manual feature extraction or deep learning, face two major challenges: the lack of large-scale datasets for robust feature learning and evaluation, and poor detection performance due to inter-subject variations. To address these challenges, we curate an EEG-AD corpus containing 813 subjects, which forms the world's largest EEG-AD dataset to the best of our knowledge. Using this unique dataset, we propose LEAD, the first large foundation model for EEG-based AD detection. Our method encompasses an entire pipeline, from data selection and preprocessing to self-supervised contrastive pretraining, fine-tuning, and key setups such as subject-independent evaluation and majority voting for subject-level detection. We pre-train the model on 11 EEG datasets and unified fine-tune it on 5 AD datasets. Our self-supervised pre-training design includes sample-level and subject-level contrasting to extract useful general EEG features. Fine-tuning is performed on 5 channel-aligned datasets together. The backbone encoder incorporates temporal and channel embeddings to capture features across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Our method demonstrates outstanding AD detection performance, achieving up to a 9.86% increase in F1 score at the sample-level and up to a 9.31% at the subject-level compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results of our model strongly confirm the effectiveness of contrastive pre-training and channel-aligned unified fine-tuning for addressing inter-subject variation.

<p>Abstract: Travel demand prediction is crucial for optimizing transportation planning, resource allocation, and infrastructure development, ensuring efficient mobility and economic sustainability. This study introduces a Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (Neurosymbolic AI) framework that integrates decision tree (DT)-based symbolic rules with neural networks (NNs) to predict travel demand, leveraging the interpretability of symbolic reasoning and the predictive power of neural learning. The framework utilizes data from diverse sources, including geospatial, economic, and mobility datasets, to build a comprehensive feature set. DTs are employed to extract interpretable if-then rules that capture key patterns, which are then incorporated as additional features into a NN to enhance its predictive capabilities. Experimental results show that the combined dataset, enriched with symbolic rules, consistently outperforms standalone datasets across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), \(R^2\), and Common Part of Commuters (CPC). Rules selected at finer variance thresholds (e.g., 0.0001) demonstrate superior effectiveness in capturing nuanced relationships, reducing prediction errors, and aligning with observed commuter patterns. By merging symbolic and neural learning paradigms, this Neurosymbolic approach achieves both interpretability and accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in both model supply and application demands. To facilitate effective matching between them, reliable, generic and efficient benchmark generators are widely needed. However, human annotators are constrained by inefficiency, and current LLM benchmark generators not only lack generalizability but also struggle with limited reliability, as they lack a comprehensive evaluation framework for validation and optimization. To fill this gap, we first propose an automated and unbiased evaluation framework, structured around four dimensions and ten criteria. Under this framework, we carefully analyze the advantages and weaknesses of directly prompting LLMs as generic benchmark generators. To enhance the reliability, we introduce a series of methods to address the identified weaknesses and integrate them as BenchMaker. Experiments across multiple LLMs and tasks confirm that BenchMaker achieves superior or comparable performance to human-annotated benchmarks on all metrics, highlighting its generalizability and reliability. More importantly, it delivers highly consistent evaluation results across 12 LLMs (0.967 Pearson correlation against MMLU-Pro), while taking only $0.005 and 0.38 minutes per sample.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srinitish Srinivasan, Omkumar CU</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning has emerged as a cornerstone for tasks like node classification and link prediction, yet prevailing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods face challenges such as computational inefficiency, reliance on contrastive objectives, and representation collapse. Existing approaches often depend on feature reconstruction, negative sampling, or complex decoders, which introduce training overhead and hinder generalization. Further, current techniques which address such limitations fail to account for the contribution of node embeddings to a certain prediction in the absence of labeled nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel joint embedding predictive framework for graph SSL that eliminates contrastive objectives and negative sampling while preserving semantic and structural information. Additionally, we introduce a semantic-aware objective term that incorporates pseudo-labels derived from Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), enhancing node discriminability by evaluating latent feature contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art graph SSL methods across benchmarks, achieving superior performance without contrastive loss or complex decoders. Key innovations include (1) a non-contrastive, view-invariant joint embedding predictive architecture, (2) Leveraging single context and multiple targets relationship between subgraphs, and (3) GMM-based pseudo-label scoring to capture semantic contributions. This work advances graph SSL by offering a computationally efficient, collapse-resistant paradigm that bridges spatial and semantic graph features for downstream tasks.

<p>Abstract: The rise of single-cell sequencing technologies has revolutionized the exploration of drug resistance, revealing the crucial role of cellular heterogeneity in advancing precision medicine. By building computational models from existing single-cell drug response data, we can rapidly annotate cellular responses to drugs in subsequent trials. To this end, we developed scGSDR, a model that integrates two computational pipelines grounded in the knowledge of cellular states and gene signaling pathways, both essential for understanding biological gene semantics. scGSDR enhances predictive performance by incorporating gene semantics and employs an interpretability module to identify key pathways contributing to drug resistance phenotypes. Our extensive validation, which included 16 experiments covering 11 drugs, demonstrates scGSDR's superior predictive accuracy, when trained with either bulk-seq or scRNA-seq data, achieving high AUROC, AUPR, and F1 Scores. The model's application has extended from single-drug predictions to scenarios involving drug combinations. Leveraging pathways of known drug target genes, we found that scGSDR's cell-pathway attention scores are biologically interpretable, which helped us identify other potential drug-related genes. Literature review of top-ranking genes in our predictions such as BCL2, CCND1, the AKT family, and PIK3CA for PLX4720; and ICAM1, VCAM1, NFKB1, NFKBIA, and RAC1 for Paclitaxel confirmed their relevance. In conclusion, scGSDR, by incorporating gene semantics, enhances predictive modeling of cellular responses to diverse drugs, proving invaluable for scenarios involving both single drug and combination therapies and effectively identifying key resistance-related pathways, thus advancing precision medicine and targeted therapy development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable extraction of structured data from radiology reports using Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging, especially for complex, non-English texts like Hebrew. This study introduces an agent-based uncertainty-aware approach to improve the trustworthiness of LLM predictions in medical applications. We analyzed 9,683 Hebrew radiology reports from Crohn's disease patients (from 2010 to 2023) across three medical centers. A subset of 512 reports was manually annotated for six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathological findings, while the remaining reports were automatically annotated using HSMP-BERT. Structured data extraction was performed using Llama 3.1 (Llama 3-8b-instruct) with Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (BayesPE), which employed six semantically equivalent prompts to estimate uncertainty. An Agent-Based Decision Model integrated multiple prompt outputs into five confidence levels for calibrated uncertainty and was compared against three entropy-based models. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and Cohen's Kappa before and after filtering high-uncertainty cases. The agent-based model outperformed the baseline across all metrics, achieving an F1 score of 0.3967, recall of 0.6437, and Cohen's Kappa of 0.3006. After filtering high-uncertainty cases (greater than or equal to 0.5), the F1 score improved to 0.4787, and Kappa increased to 0.4258. Uncertainty histograms demonstrated clear separation between correct and incorrect predictions, with the agent-based model providing the most well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By incorporating uncertainty-aware prompt ensembles and an agent-based decision model, this approach enhances the performance and reliability of LLMs in structured data extraction from radiology reports, offering a more interpretable and trustworthy solution for high-stakes medical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kim Yong Tan, Yueming Lyu, Ivor Tsang, Yew-Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion-model to address the specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training of the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, the offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an \textbf{online} algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a \textbf{black-box} objective function. Moreover, the \textbf{query efficiency} of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in the real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, \textbf{Fast Direct}, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively.

<p>Abstract: In complex systems, information propagation can be defined as diffused or delocalized, weakly localized, and strongly localized. Can a machine learning model learn the behavior of a linear dynamical system on networks? In this work, we develop a graph neural network framework for identifying the steady-state behavior of the linear dynamical system. We reveal that our model learns the different states with high accuracy. To understand the explainability of our model, we provide an analytical derivation for the forward and backward propagation of our framework. Finally, we use the real-world graphs in our model for validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alan Zhu, Parth Asawa, Jared Quincy Davis, Lingjiao Chen, Ion Stoica, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Matei Zaharia</p>
<p>Abstract: As the demand for high-quality data in model training grows, researchers and developers are increasingly generating synthetic data to tune and train LLMs. A common assumption about synthetic data is that sampling from instruct-tuned models is sufficient; however, these models struggle to produce diverse outputs-a key requirement for generalization. Despite various prompting methods, in this work we show that achieving meaningful diversity from instruct-tuned models remains challenging. In contrast, we find base models without post-training exhibit greater diversity, but are less capable at instruction following and hence of lower quality. Leveraging this insight, we propose Base-Refine (BARE), a synthetic data generation method that combines the diversity of base models with the quality of instruct-tuned models through a two-stage process. With minimal few-shot examples and curation, BARE generates diverse and high-quality datasets, improving downstream task performance. We show that fine-tuning with as few as 1,000 BARE-generated samples can reach performance comparable to the best similarly sized models on LiveCodeBench tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning with BARE-generated data achieves a 101% improvement over instruct-only data on GSM8K and a 18.4% improvement over SOTA methods on RAFT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moses Ananta, Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Zayd Muhammad Kawakibi Zuhri, Ayu Purwarianti, Alham Fikri Aji</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by the computational costs of processing massive datasets. We propose \textbf{QLESS} (Quantized Low-rank Gradient Similarity Search), which integrates gradient quantization with the LESS framework to enable memory-efficient data valuation and selection. QLESS employs a two-step compression process: first, it obtains low-dimensional gradient representations through LoRA-based random projection; then, it quantizes these gradients to low-bitwidth representations. Experiments on multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen) and benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA) show that QLESS achieves comparable data selection performance to LESS while reducing memory usage by up to 16x. Even 1-bit gradient quantization preserves data valuation quality. These findings underscore QLESS as a practical, scalable approach to identifying informative examples within strict memory constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biologically inspired neural networks offer alternative avenues to model data distributions. FlyVec is a recent example that draws inspiration from the fruit fly's olfactory circuit to tackle the task of learning word embeddings. Surprisingly, this model performs competitively even against deep learning approaches specifically designed to encode text, and it does so with the highest degree of computational efficiency. We pose the question of whether this performance can be improved further. For this, we introduce Comply. By incorporating positional information through complex weights, we enable a single-layer neural network to learn sequence representations. Our experiments show that Comply not only supersedes FlyVec but also performs on par with significantly larger state-of-the-art models. We achieve this without additional parameters. Comply yields sparse contextual representations of sentences that can be interpreted explicitly from the neuron weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yirui Zeng, Jun Fu, Hadi Amirpour, Huasheng Wang, Guanghui Yue, Hantao Liu, Ying Chen, Wei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind dehazed image quality assessment (BDQA), which aims to accurately predict the visual quality of dehazed images without any reference information, is essential for the evaluation, comparison, and optimization of image dehazing algorithms. Existing learning-based BDQA methods have achieved remarkable success, while the small scale of DQA datasets limits their performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to adapt Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP), pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs, to the BDQA task. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the human visual system understands images based on hierarchical features, we take global and local information of the dehazed image as the input of CLIP. To accurately map the input hierarchical information of dehazed images into the quality score, we tune both the vision branch and language branch of CLIP with prompt learning. Experimental results on two authentic DQA datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach, named CLIP-DQA, achieves more accurate quality predictions over existing BDQA methods.

The relations we concern are algebraic operations, binary relations, and binary relations with composition that can be reasoned categorically. A machine learning system transformation between two systems is a map between the systems, which preserves the relations we concern. The system transformations given by quotient or clustering, representable functor, and Yoneda embedding are highlighted and discussed by machine learning examples. An adjunction between machine learning systems, a special machine learning system transformation loop, provides the optimal way of solving problems. Machine learning system transformations are linked and compared by their maps at 2-cell, natural transformations. New insights and structures can be obtained from universal properties and algebraic structures given by monads, which are generated from adjunctions.</p>

Tools like LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation have expanded LLM capabilities, enabling deeper integration into MAS through enhanced knowledge retrieval and reasoning. However, these advancements introduce critical challenges: LLM agents exhibit inherent unpredictability, and uncertainties in their outputs can compound across interactions, threatening system stability. To address these risks, a human-centered design approach with active dynamic moderation is essential. Such an approach enhances traditional passive oversight by facilitating coherent inter-agent communication and effective system governance, allowing MAS to achieve desired outcomes more efficiently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufan Ye, Ting Zhang, Wenbin Jiang, Hua Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning strategies based on outcome supervision have proven effective in enhancing the performance of large language models(LLMs) for code generation. While reinforcement learning based on process supervision has shown great promise in handling multi-step reasoning tasks, its effectiveness in code generation remains largely underexplored and underjustified. The primary obstacle stems from the resource-intensive nature of constructing high-quality process-supervised data, which demands substantial human expertise and computational resources. In response to this challenge, we propose a "statement mutation/refactoring-compile and execution verification" strategy: mutating and refactoring code line-by-line through a teacher model, and utilizing compiler execution results to automatically label each line, resulting in line-by-line process-supervised data, which is pivotal for training a process-supervised reward model. The trained reward model is then integrated into the PRLCoder framework, followed by experimental validation on several benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that process-supervised reinforcement learning significantly surpasses methods relying solely on outcome supervision. Notably, in tackling complex code generation tasks, process-supervised reinforcement learning shows a clear advantage, ensuring both the integrity of the code generation process and the correctness of the generation results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaye Zeng, Dongfu Jiang, Haozhe Wang, Ping Nie, Xiaotong Chen, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Most progress in recent coder models has been driven by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), while the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of reliable reward data/model in the code domain. In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis to enhance code model training. Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data. Using these test cases, we construct preference pairs based on pass rates over sampled programs to train reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. It shows an average of 10-point improvement for Llama-3.1-8B-Ins and 5-point improvement for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Ins through best-of-32 sampling, making the 7B model on par with 236B DeepSeek-V2.5. Furthermore, we conduct reinforcement learning with both reward models and test-case pass rewards, leading to consistent improvements across HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench (V4). Notably, we follow the R1-style training to start from Qwen2.5-Coder-base directly and show that our RL training can improve model on HumanEval-plus by over 25\% and MBPP-plus by 6\% for merely 80 optimization steps. We believe our results highlight the huge potential of reinforcement learning in coder models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitry Manning-Coe, Jacopo Gliozzi, Alexander G. Stapleton, Edward Hirst, Giuseppe De Tomasi, Barry Bradlyn, David S. Berman</p>
<p>Abstract: Grokking typically achieves similar loss to ordinary, "steady", learning. We ask whether these different learning paths - grokking versus ordinary training - lead to fundamental differences in the learned models. To do so we compare the features, compressibility, and learning dynamics of models trained via each path in two tasks. We find that grokked and steadily trained models learn the same features, but there can be large differences in the efficiency with which these features are encoded. In particular, we find a novel "compressive regime" of steady training in which there emerges a linear trade-off between model loss and compressibility, and which is absent in grokking. In this regime, we can achieve compression factors 25x times the base model, and 5x times the compression achieved in grokking. We then track how model features and compressibility develop through training. We show that model development in grokking is task-dependent, and that peak compressibility is achieved immediately after the grokking plateau. Finally, novel information-geometric measures are introduced which demonstrate that models undergoing grokking follow a straight path in information space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nina Corvelo Benz, Stratis Tsirtsis, Eleni Straitouri, Ivi Chatzi, Ander Artola Velasco, Suhas Thejaswi, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: State of the art large language models rely on randomization to respond to a prompt. As an immediate consequence, a model may respond differently to the same prompt if asked multiple times. In this work, we argue that the evaluation and ranking of large language models should control for the randomization underpinning their functioning. Our starting point is the development of a causal model for coupled autoregressive generation, which allows different large language models to sample responses with the same source of randomness. Building upon our causal model, we first show that, on evaluations based on benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation leads to the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation but using provably fewer samples. However, we further show that, on evaluations based on (human) pairwise comparisons, coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation can surprisingly lead to different rankings when comparing more than two models, even with an infinite amount of samples. This suggests that the apparent advantage of a model over others in existing evaluation protocols may not be genuine but rather confounded by the randomness inherent to the generation process. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the Llama family. We find that, across multiple knowledge areas from the popular MMLU benchmark dataset, coupled autoregressive generation requires up to 40% fewer samples to reach the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation. Further, using data from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform, we find that the win-rates derived from pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model to prompts differ under coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained transformer models with extended context windows are notoriously expensive to run at scale, often limiting real-world deployment due to their high computational and memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce Hamming Attention Distillation (HAD), a novel framework that binarizes keys and queries in the attention mechanism to achieve significant efficiency gains. By converting keys and queries into {-1, +1} vectors and replacing dot-product operations with efficient Hamming distance computations, our method drastically reduces computational overhead. Additionally, we incorporate attention matrix sparsification to prune low-impact activations, which further reduces the cost of processing long-context sequences. \par Despite these aggressive compression strategies, our distilled approach preserves a high degree of representational power, leading to substantially improved accuracy compared to prior transformer binarization methods. We evaluate HAD on a range of tasks and models, including the GLUE benchmark, ImageNet, and QuALITY, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance among binarized Transformers while drastically reducing the computational costs of long-context inference. \par We implement HAD in custom hardware simulations, demonstrating superior performance characteristics compared to a custom hardware implementation of standard attention. HAD achieves just $\mathbf{1.78}\%$ performance losses on GLUE compared to $9.08\%$ in state-of-the-art binarization work, and $\mathbf{2.5}\%$ performance losses on ImageNet compared to $12.14\%$, all while targeting custom hardware with a $\mathbf{79}\%$ area reduction and $\mathbf{87}\%$ power reduction compared to its standard attention counterpart.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prashant Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Cass Sunstein's essay 'On Bob Dylan' describes Dylan's 'dishabituating' style -- a constant refusal to conform to expectation and a penchant for reinventing his musical and lyrical identity. In this paper, I extend Sunstein's observations through a large-scale computational analysis of Dylan's lyrics from 1962 to 2012. Using o3-mini-high (a large language model), I extract concept-to-concept relationships from the lyrics and construct directed knowledge graphs that capture Dylan's thematic structure. I then quantify shifts in sentiment, metaphorical expression, thematic diversity, and network complexity over time. The results indicate that Dylan's lyrics increasingly rely on metaphor, display an evolving sentiment profile, and exhibit heightened dishabituation -- measured here as a growing variance in the network centrality of key concepts. I also find that references to movement, protest, and mythic imagery fluctuate in ways that align with well-known phases of Dylan's career, reflecting the dynamic and unpredictable quality of his art. These findings not only deepen our empirical understanding of Sunstein's thesis but also introduce a novel computational method for analyzing an artist's evolution-offering broader applicability to the study of cultural and creative change.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Breno W. Carvalho, Artur S. d'Avila Garcez, Lu\'is C. Lamb, Em\'ilio Vital Brazil</p>
<p>Abstract: Grokking, or delayed generalization, is an intriguing learning phenomenon where test set loss decreases sharply only after a model's training set loss has converged. This challenges conventional understanding of the training dynamics in deep learning networks. In this paper, we formalize and investigate grokking, highlighting that a key factor in its emergence is a distribution shift between training and test data. We introduce two synthetic datasets specifically designed to analyze grokking. One dataset examines the impact of limited sampling, and the other investigates transfer learning's role in grokking. By inducing distribution shifts through controlled imbalanced sampling of sub-categories, we systematically reproduce the phenomenon, demonstrating that while small-sampling is strongly associated with grokking, it is not its cause. Instead, small-sampling serves as a convenient mechanism for achieving the necessary distribution shift. We also show that when classes form an equivariant map, grokking can be explained by the model's ability to learn from similar classes or sub-categories. Unlike earlier work suggesting that grokking primarily arises from high regularization and sparse data, we demonstrate that it can also occur with dense data and minimal hyper-parameter tuning. Our findings deepen the understanding of grokking and pave the way for developing better stopping criteria in future training processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: The preservation of aquatic biodiversity is critical in mitigating the effects of climate change. Aquatic scene understanding plays a pivotal role in aiding marine scientists in their decision-making processes. In this paper, we introduce AquaticCLIP, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model tailored for aquatic scene understanding. AquaticCLIP presents a new unsupervised learning framework that aligns images and texts in aquatic environments, enabling tasks such as segmentation, classification, detection, and object counting. By leveraging our large-scale underwater image-text paired dataset without the need for ground-truth annotations, our model enriches existing vision-language models in the aquatic domain. For this purpose, we construct a 2 million underwater image-text paired dataset using heterogeneous resources, including YouTube, Netflix, NatGeo, etc. To fine-tune AquaticCLIP, we propose a prompt-guided vision encoder that progressively aggregates patch features via learnable prompts, while a vision-guided mechanism enhances the language encoder by incorporating visual context. The model is optimized through a contrastive pretraining loss to align visual and textual modalities. AquaticCLIP achieves notable performance improvements in zero-shot settings across multiple underwater computer vision tasks, outperforming existing methods in both robustness and interpretability. Our model sets a new benchmark for vision-language applications in underwater environments. The code and dataset for AquaticCLIP are publicly available on GitHub at xxx.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain randomization in reinforcement learning is an established technique for increasing the robustness of control policies trained in simulation. By randomizing environment properties during training, the learned policy can become robust to uncertainties along the randomized dimensions. While the environment distribution is typically specified by hand, in this paper we investigate automatically discovering a sampling distribution via entropy-regularized reward maximization of a normalizing-flow-based neural sampling distribution. We show that this architecture is more flexible and provides greater robustness than existing approaches that learn simpler, parameterized sampling distributions, as demonstrated in six simulated and one real-world robotics domain. Lastly, we explore how these learned sampling distributions, combined with a privileged value function, can be used for out-of-distribution detection in an uncertainty-aware multi-step manipulation planner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchen Wu, Stephan Alaniz, Eric Schulz, Zeynep Akata</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding neural networks is challenging due to their high-dimensional, interacting components. Inspired by human cognition, which processes complex sensory data by chunking it into recurring entities, we propose leveraging this principle to interpret artificial neural population activities. Biological and artificial intelligence share the challenge of learning from structured, naturalistic data, and we hypothesize that the cognitive mechanism of chunking can provide insights into artificial systems. We first demonstrate this concept in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on artificial sequences with imposed regularities, observing that their hidden states reflect these patterns, which can be extracted as a dictionary of chunks that influence network responses. Extending this to large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA, we identify similar recurring embedding states corresponding to concepts in the input, with perturbations to these states activating or inhibiting the associated concepts. By exploring methods to extract dictionaries of identifiable chunks across neural embeddings of varying complexity, our findings introduce a new framework for interpreting neural networks, framing their population activity as structured reflections of the data they process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Velasco, Aya Garryyeva, David N. Palacio, Antonio Mastropaolo, Denys Poshyvanyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for Large Code Models (LCMs), enabling automation in complex software engineering tasks, such as code generation, software testing, and program comprehension, among others. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have shown substantial benefits in supporting developers across various practices. However, the ambition to scale these models to trillion-parameter sizes, exemplified by GPT-4, poses significant challenges that limit the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems powered by large Deep Learning (DL) models. These include rising computational demands for training and deployment and issues related to trustworthiness, bias, and interpretability. Such factors can make managing these models impractical for many organizations, while their "black-box'' nature undermines key aspects, including transparency and accountability. In this paper, we question the prevailing assumption that increasing model parameters is always the optimal path forward, provided there is sufficient new data to learn additional patterns. In particular, we advocate for a Neurosymbolic research direction that combines the strengths of existing DL techniques (e.g., LLMs) with traditional symbolic methods--renowned for their reliability, speed, and determinism. To this end, we outline the core features and present preliminary results for our envisioned approach, aimed at establishing the first Neurosymbolic Program Comprehension (NsPC) framework to aid in identifying defective code components.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyang Zhao, Haoxian Chen, Ji Zhang, David D. Yao, Wenpin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which aligns a diffusion model with input prompt, has become a crucial step in building reliable generative AI models. Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runxiang Cheng, Michele Tufano, J\"urgen Cito, Jos\'e Cambronero, Pat Rondon, Renyao Wei, Aaron Sun, Satish Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Bug reports often lack sufficient detail for developers to reproduce and fix the underlying defects. Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs), tests that fail when the bug is present and pass when it has been resolved, are crucial for debugging, but they are rarely included in bug reports, both in open-source and in industrial settings. Thus, automatically generating BRTs from bug reports has the potential to accelerate the debugging process and lower time to repair. This paper investigates automated BRT generation within an industry setting, specifically at Google, focusing on the challenges of a large-scale, proprietary codebase and considering real-world industry bugs extracted from Google's internal issue tracker. We adapt and evaluate a state-of-the-art BRT generation technique, LIBRO, and present our agent-based approach, BRT Agent, which makes use of a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for code editing. Our BRT Agent significantly outperforms LIBRO, achieving a 28% plausible BRT generation rate, compared to 10% by LIBRO, on 80 human-reported bugs from Google's internal issue tracker. We further investigate the practical value of generated BRTs by integrating them with an Automated Program Repair (APR) system at Google. Our results show that providing BRTs to the APR system results in 30% more bugs with plausible fixes. Additionally, we introduce Ensemble Pass Rate (EPR), a metric which leverages the generated BRTs to select the most promising fixes from all fixes generated by APR system. Our evaluation on EPR for Top-K and threshold-based fix selections demonstrates promising results and trade-offs. For example, EPR correctly selects a plausible fix from a pool of 20 candidates in 70% of cases, based on its top-1 ranking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data augmentation has become a standard practice in software engineering to address limited or imbalanced data sets, particularly in specialized domains like test classification and bug detection where data can be scarce. Although techniques such as SMOTE and mutation-based augmentation are widely used in software testing and debugging applications, a rigorous understanding of how augmented training data impacts model bias is lacking. It is especially critical to consider bias in scenarios where augmented data sets are used not just in training but also in testing models. Through a comprehensive case study of flaky test classification, we demonstrate how to test for bias and understand the impact that the inclusion of augmented samples in testing sets can have on model evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Paul E. Apolinario, Kaushik Roy, Charlotte Frenkel</p>
<p>Abstract: The demand for low-power inference and training of deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has intensified the need for algorithms that are both scalable and energy-efficient. While spiking neural networks (SNNs) allow for efficient inference by processing complex spatio-temporal dynamics in an event-driven fashion, training them on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of conventional error backpropagation (BP)-based approaches. In this work, we draw inspiration from biological mechanisms such as eligibility traces, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and neural activity synchronization to introduce TESS, a temporally and spatially local learning rule for training SNNs. Our approach addresses both temporal and spatial credit assignments by relying solely on locally available signals within each neuron, thereby allowing computational and memory overheads to scale linearly with the number of neurons, independently of the number of time steps. Despite relying on local mechanisms, we demonstrate performance comparable to the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, within $\sim1.4$ accuracy points on challenging computer vision scenarios relevant at the edge, such as the IBM DVS Gesture dataset, CIFAR10-DVS, and temporal versions of CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Being able to produce comparable performance to BPTT while keeping low time and memory complexity, TESS enables efficient and scalable on-device learning at the edge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Zhao, Pranjal Awasthi, Sreenivas Gollapudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Sampling-based search, a simple paradigm for utilizing test-time compute, involves generating multiple candidate responses and selecting the best one -- typically by verifying each response for correctness. In this paper, we study the scaling trends governing sampling-based search. Among our findings is that simply scaling up a minimalist implementation that uses only random sampling and direct self-verification results in sustained performance improvements that, for example, elevate the Gemini v1.5 Pro model's reasoning capabilities past that of o1-Preview on popular benchmarks. We partially attribute the scalability of sampling-based search to a phenomenon of implicit scaling, where sampling a larger pool of responses in turn improves verification accuracy. We further identify two useful principles for improving self-verification capabilities with test-time compute: (1) comparing across responses provides helpful signals about the locations of errors and hallucinations, and (2) different model output styles are useful for different contexts -- chains of thought are useful for reasoning but harder to verify. We also find that, though accurate verification can be elicited, frontier models demonstrate remarkably weak out-of-box verification capabilities and introduce a benchmark to measure progress on these deficiencies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human-robot cooperative navigation is challenging in environments with incomplete information. We introduce CoNav-Maze, a simulated robotics environment where a robot navigates using local perception while a human operator provides guidance based on an inaccurate map. The robot can share its camera views to improve the operator's understanding of the environment. To enable efficient human-robot cooperation, we propose Information Gain Monte Carlo Tree Search (IG-MCTS), an online planning algorithm that balances autonomous movement and informative communication. Central to IG-MCTS is a neural human perception dynamics model that estimates how humans distill information from robot communications. We collect a dataset through a crowdsourced mapping task in CoNav-Maze and train this model using a fully convolutional architecture with data augmentation. User studies show that IG-MCTS outperforms teleoperation and instruction-following baselines, achieving comparable task performance with significantly less communication and lower human cognitive load, as evidenced by eye-tracking metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edoardo Urettini, Antonio Carta</p>
<p>Abstract: Online Continual Learning (OCL) models continuously adapt to nonstationary data streams, usually without task information. These settings are complex and many traditional CL methods fail, while online methods (mainly replay-based) suffer from instabilities after the task shift. To address this issue, we formalize replay-based OCL as a second-order online joint optimization with explicit KL-divergence constraints on replay data. We propose Online Curvature-Aware Replay (OCAR) to solve the problem: a method that leverages second-order information of the loss using a K-FAC approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to precondition the gradient. The FIM acts as a stabilizer to prevent forgetting while also accelerating the optimization in non-interfering directions. We show how to adapt the estimation of the FIM to a continual setting stabilizing second-order optimization for non-iid data, uncovering the role of the Tikhonov regularization in the stability-plasticity tradeoff. Empirical results show that OCAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in continual metrics achieving higher average accuracy throughout the training process in three different benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yipu Zhang, Likai Wang, Kuan-Jui Su, Aiying Zhang, Hao Zhu, Xiaowen Liu, Hui Shen, Vince D. Calhoun, Yuping Wang, Hongwen Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its derived functional connectivity networks (FCNs) have become critical for understanding neurological disorders. However, collaborative analyses and the generalizability of models still face significant challenges due to privacy regulations and the non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) property of multiple data sources. To mitigate these difficulties, we propose Domain Adversarial Federated Learning (DAFed), a novel federated deep learning framework specifically designed for non-IID fMRI data analysis in multi-site settings. DAFed addresses these challenges through feature disentanglement, decomposing the latent feature space into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, to ensure robust global learning while preserving local data specificity. Furthermore, adversarial training facilitates effective knowledge transfer between labeled and unlabeled datasets, while a contrastive learning module enhances the global representation of domain-invariant features. We evaluated DAFed on the diagnosis of ASD and further validated its generalizability in the classification of AD, demonstrating its superior classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, an enhanced Score-CAM module identifies key brain regions and functional connectivity significantly associated with ASD and MCI, respectively, uncovering shared neurobiological patterns across sites. These findings highlight the potential of DAFed to advance multi-site collaborative research in neuroimaging while protecting data confidentiality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Chen, Yue Xie, Qingpeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) theory seeks to determine the map $T:X \to Y$ that transports a source measure $P$ to a target measure $Q$, minimizing the cost $c(\mathbf{x}, T(\mathbf{x}))$ between $\mathbf{x}$ and its image $T(\mathbf{x})$. Building upon the Input Convex Neural Network OT solver and incorporating the concept of displacement-sparse maps, we introduce a sparsity penalty into the minimax Wasserstein formulation, promote sparsity in displacement vectors $\Delta(\mathbf{x}) := T(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{x}$, and enhance the interpretability of the resulting map. However, increasing sparsity often reduces feasibility, causing $T_{\#}(P)$ to deviate more significantly from the target measure. In low-dimensional settings, we propose a heuristic framework to balance the trade-off between sparsity and feasibility by dynamically adjusting the sparsity intensity parameter during training. For high-dimensional settings, we directly constrain the dimensionality of displacement vectors by enforcing $\dim(\Delta(\mathbf{x})) \leq l$, where $l < d$ for $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. Among maps satisfying this constraint, we aim to identify the most feasible one. This goal can be effectively achieved by adapting our low-dimensional heuristic framework without resorting to dimensionality reduction. We validate our method on both synthesized sc-RNA and real 4i cell perturbation datasets, demonstrating improvements over existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The history of art has seen significant shifts in the manner in which artworks are created, making understanding of creative processes a central question in technical art history. In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, paintings were largely produced by master painters directing workshops of apprentices who often contributed to projects. The masters varied significantly in artistic and managerial styles, meaning different combinations of artists and implements might be seen both between masters and within workshops or even individual canvases. Information on how different workshops were managed and the processes by which artworks were created remains elusive. Machine learning methods have potential to unearth new information about artists' creative processes by extending the analysis of brushwork to a microscopic scale. Analysis of workshop paintings, however, presents a challenge in that documentation of the artists and materials involved is sparse, meaning external examples are not available to train networks to recognize their contributions. Here we present a novel machine learning approach we call pairwise assignment training for classifying heterogeneity (PATCH) that is capable of identifying individual artistic practice regimes with no external training data, or "ground truth." The method achieves unsupervised results by supervised means, and outperforms both simple statistical procedures and unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply this method to two historical paintings by the Spanish Renaissance master, El Greco: The Baptism of Christ and Christ on the Cross with Landscape, and our findings regarding the former potentially challenge previous work that has assigned the painting to workshop members. Further, the results of our analyses create a measure of heterogeneity of artistic practice that can be used to characterize artworks across time and space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Cooper-Baldock, Stephen Turnock, Karl Sammut</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) encounter significant energy, control and navigation challenges in complex underwater environments, particularly during close-proximity operations, such as launch and recovery (LAR), where fluid interactions and wake effects present additional navigational and energy challenges. Traditional path planning methods fail to incorporate these detailed wake structures, resulting in increased energy consumption, reduced control stability, and heightened safety risks. This paper presents a novel wake-informed, 3D path planning approach that fully integrates localized wake effects and global currents into the planning algorithm. Two variants of the A* algorithm - a current-informed planner and a wake-informed planner - are created to assess its validity and two neural network models are then trained to approximate these planners for real-time applications. Both the A* planners and NN models are evaluated using important metrics such as energy expenditure, path length, and encounters with high-velocity and turbulent regions. The results demonstrate a wake-informed A* planner consistently achieves the lowest energy expenditure and minimizes encounters with high-velocity regions, reducing energy consumption by up to 11.3%. The neural network models are observed to offer computational speedup of 6 orders of magnitude, but exhibit 4.51 - 19.79% higher energy expenditures and 9.81 - 24.38% less optimal paths. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating detailed wake structures into traditional path planning algorithms and the benefits of neural network approximations to enhance energy efficiency and operational safety for AUVs in complex 3D domains.</p>

Our approach effectively utilizes the rich natural language of event descriptions, allowing LLMs to benefit from their broad world knowledge for reasoning across different domains and tasks. This allows us to extend the scope of asynchronous time series analysis beyond forecasting to include tasks like anomaly detection and data imputation. We further introduce Stochastic Soft Prompting, a novel prompt-tuning mechanism that significantly improves model performance, outperforming existing fine-tuning methods such as QLoRA. Through extensive experiments on real world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across different tasks and datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: A major challenge in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is the issue of distribution shift. LLM alignment algorithms rely on static preference datasets, assuming that they accurately represent real-world user preferences. However, user preferences vary significantly across geographical regions, demographics, linguistic patterns, and evolving cultural trends. This preference distribution shift leads to catastrophic alignment failures in many real-world applications. We address this problem using the principled framework of distributionally robust optimization, and develop two novel distributionally robust direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithms, namely, Wasserstein DPO (WDPO) and Kullback-Leibler DPO (KLDPO). We characterize the sample complexity of learning the optimal policy parameters for WDPO and KLDPO. Moreover, we propose scalable gradient descent-style learning algorithms by developing suitable approximations for the challenging minimax loss functions of WDPO and KLDPO. Our empirical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of WDPO and KLDPO in substantially improving the alignment when there is a preference distribution shift.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant progress, largely fueled by the development of specialized testbeds that enable systematic evaluation of algorithms in controlled yet challenging scenarios. However, existing testbeds often focus on purely virtual simulations or limited robot morphologies such as robotic arms, quadrupeds, and humanoids, leaving high-mobility platforms with real-world physical constraints like drones underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present VolleyBots, a new MARL testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots features a turn-based interaction model under volleyball rules, a hierarchical decision-making process that combines motion control and strategic play, and a high-fidelity simulation for seamless sim-to-real transfer. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative MARL and game-theoretic algorithms. Results in simulation show that while existing algorithms handle simple tasks effectively, they encounter difficulty in complex tasks that require both low-level control and high-level strategy. We further demonstrate zero-shot deployment of a simulation-learned policy to real-world drones, highlighting VolleyBots' potential to propel MARL research involving agile robotic platforms.

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates an under-explored challenge in large language models (LLMs): the impact of KV cache compression methods on LLMs' fundamental capabilities. While existing methods achieve impressive compression ratios on long-context benchmarks, their effects on core model capabilities remain understudied. We present a comprehensive empirical study evaluating prominent KV cache compression methods across diverse tasks, spanning world knowledge, commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, safety, and long-context understanding and generation.Our analysis reveals that KV cache compression methods exhibit task-specific performance degradation. Arithmetic reasoning tasks prove particularly sensitive to aggressive compression, with different methods showing performance drops of $17.4\%$-$43.3\%$. Notably, the DeepSeek R1 Distill model exhibits more robust compression tolerance compared to instruction-tuned models, showing only $9.67\%$-$25.53\%$ performance degradation. Based on our analysis of attention patterns and cross-task compression performance, we propose ShotKV, a novel compression approach that distinctly handles prefill and decoding phases while maintaining shot-level semantic coherence. Empirical results show that ShotKV achieves $9\%$-$18\%$ performance improvements on long-context generation tasks under aggressive compression ratios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingling Li, Wushao Wen, Jinghui Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: The Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) task aims to extract aspect terms, opinion terms, and their corresponding sentiment polarity from a given sentence. It remains one of the most prominent subtasks in fine-grained sentiment analysis. Most existing approaches frame triplet extraction as a 2D table-filling process in an end-to-end manner, focusing primarily on word-level interactions while often overlooking sentence-level representations. This limitation hampers the model's ability to capture global contextual information, particularly when dealing with multi-word aspect and opinion terms in complex sentences. To address these issues, we propose boundary-driven table-filling with cross-granularity contrastive learning (BTF-CCL) to enhance the semantic consistency between sentence-level representations and word-level representations. By constructing positive and negative sample pairs, the model is forced to learn the associations at both the sentence level and the word level. Additionally, a multi-scale, multi-granularity convolutional method is proposed to capture rich semantic information better. Our approach can capture sentence-level contextual information more effectively while maintaining sensitivity to local details. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks according to the F1 score.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the field of text-guided 3D scene generation has garnered significant attention. High-quality generation that aligns with physical realism and high controllability is crucial for practical 3D scene applications. However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Sharma, Janina Hoffmann, Vinay Namboodiri</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of long-horizon visual planning tasks using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our key contribution is a Discrete Hierarchical Planning (DHP) method, an alternative to traditional distance-based approaches. We provide theoretical foundations for the method and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive empirical evaluations.
  Our agent recursively predicts subgoals in the context of a long-term goal and receives discrete rewards for constructing plans as compositions of abstract actions. The method introduces a novel advantage estimation strategy for tree trajectories, which inherently encourages shorter plans and enables generalization beyond the maximum tree depth. The learned policy function allows the agent to plan efficiently, requiring only $\log N$ computational steps, making re-planning highly efficient. The agent, based on a soft-actor critic (SAC) framework, is trained using on-policy imagination data. Additionally, we propose a novel exploration strategy that enables the agent to generate relevant training examples for the planning modules. We evaluate our method on long-horizon visual planning tasks in a 25-room environment, where it significantly outperforms previous benchmarks at success rate and average episode length. Furthermore, an ablation study highlights the individual contributions of key modules to the overall performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlong Pang, Na Di, Zhaowei Zhu, Jiaheng Wei, Hao Cheng, Chen Qian, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs), data quality matters more than quantity. While most data cleaning methods concentrate on filtering entire samples, the quality of individual tokens within a sample can vary significantly. After pre-training, even in high-quality samples, patterns or phrases that are not task-related can be redundant or uninformative. Continuing to fine-tune on these patterns may offer limited benefit and even degrade downstream task performance. In this paper, we investigate token quality from a noisy-label perspective and propose a generic token cleaning pipeline for SFT tasks. Our method filters out uninformative tokens while preserving those carrying key task-specific information. Specifically, we first evaluate token quality by examining the influence of model updates on each token, then apply a threshold-based separation. The token influence can be measured in a single pass with a fixed reference model or iteratively with self-evolving reference models. The benefits and limitations of both methods are analyzed theoretically by error upper bounds. Extensive experiments show that our framework consistently improves performance across multiple downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Younan Zhu, Linwei Tao, Minjing Dong, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive multimodal reasoning capabilities but remain highly susceptible to object hallucination, where models generate responses that are not factually aligned with the visual content. Recent works attribute this issue to an inherent bias of LVLMs where vision token attention map has a fixed correlation with spatial position, and propose to mitigate this issue by reordering visual tokens. However, we find that different LVLMs exhibit different correlations between attention and spatial position, which makes the existing solution difficult to generalize to other LVLMs. To address this issue, we first introduce a training-free solution, Uniform Attention Calibration (UAC), that estimates the bias from single meaningless input image and applies a calibration matrix to rectify attention imbalances. To further alleviate the bias, we relax the assumption of single meaningless input in UAC and introduce a fine-tuning solution, Dynamic Attention Calibration (DAC), that enforces the consistent outputs wherever the object locates in the image via a plug-and-plays module. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UAC and DAC significantly reduce object hallucination while improving general multimodal alignment. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse LVLM architectures on various metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolin Wang, Yafei Ou, Prasoon Ambalathankandy, Gen Ota, Pengyu Dai, Masayuki Ikebe, Kenji Suzuki, Tamotsu Kamishima</p>
<p>Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation and progressive structural damage. Joint space width (JSW) is a critical indicator in conventional radiography for evaluating disease progression, which has become a prominent research topic in computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems. However, deep learning-based radiological CAD systems for JSW analysis face significant challenges in data quality, including data imbalance, limited variety, and annotation difficulties. This work introduced a challenging image synthesis scenario and proposed Layer Separation Networks (LSN) to accurately separate the soft tissue layer, the upper bone layer, and the lower bone layer in conventional radiographs of finger joints. Using these layers, the adjustable JSW images can be synthesized to address data quality challenges and achieve ground truth (GT) generation. Experimental results demonstrated that LSN-based synthetic images closely resemble real radiographs, and significantly enhanced the performance in downstream tasks. The code and dataset will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Zheng, Yixiao Chen, Weitong Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Yun Li, Zhengzhong Liu, Eric P. Xing, Hongyi Wang, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel CITER (\textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{I}nference with \textbf{T}oken-l\textbf{E}vel \textbf{R}outing) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs & LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David S. Hayden, Mao Ye, Timur Garipov, Gregory P. Meyer, Carl Vondrick, Zhao Chen, Yuning Chai, Eric Wolff, Siddhartha S. Srinivasa</p>
<p>Abstract: It is difficult to anticipate the myriad challenges that a predictive model will encounter once deployed. Common practice entails a reactive, cyclical approach: model deployment, data mining, and retraining. We instead develop a proactive longtail discovery process by imagining additional data during training. In particular, we develop general model-based longtail signals, including a differentiable, single forward pass formulation of epistemic uncertainty that does not impact model parameters or predictive performance but can flag rare or hard inputs. We leverage these signals as guidance to generate additional training data from a latent diffusion model in a process we call Longtail Guidance (LTG). Crucially, we can perform LTG without retraining the diffusion model or the predictive model, and we do not need to expose the predictive model to intermediate diffusion states. Data generated by LTG exhibit semantically meaningful variation, yield significant generalization improvements on image classification benchmarks, and can be analyzed to proactively discover, explain, and address conceptual gaps in a predictive model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tunazzina Islam, Dan Goldwasser</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, social media is pivotal in shaping public discourse, especially on polarizing issues like vaccination, where diverse moral perspectives influence individual opinions. In NLP, data scarcity and complexity of psycholinguistic tasks such as identifying morality frames makes relying solely on human annotators costly, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency due to cognitive load. To address these issues, we leverage large language models (LLMs), which are adept at adapting new tasks through few-shot learning, utilizing a handful of in-context examples coupled with explanations that connect examples to task principles. Our research explores LLMs' potential to assist human annotators in identifying morality frames within vaccination debates on social media. We employ a two-step process: generating concepts and explanations with LLMs, followed by human evaluation using a "think-aloud" tool. Our study shows that integrating LLMs into the annotation process enhances accuracy, reduces task difficulty, lowers cognitive load, suggesting a promising avenue for human-AI collaboration in complex psycholinguistic tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fr\'echet regression extends classical regression methods to non-Euclidean metric spaces, enabling the analysis of data relationships on complex structures such as manifolds and graphs. This work establishes a rigorous theoretical analysis for Fr\'echet regression through the lens of comparison geometry which leads to important considerations for its use in practice. The analysis provides key results on the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the Fr\'echet mean, along with statistical guarantees for nonparametric regression, including exponential concentration bounds and convergence rates. Additionally, insights into angle stability reveal the interplay between curvature of the manifold and the behavior of the regression estimator in these non-Euclidean contexts. Empirical experiments validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed hyperbolic mappings, particularly for data with heteroscedasticity, and highlighting the practical usefulness of these results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Security misconfigurations in Container Orchestrators (COs) can pose serious threats to software systems. While Static Analysis Tools (SATs) can effectively detect these security vulnerabilities, the industry currently lacks automated solutions capable of fixing these misconfigurations. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), with their proven capabilities in code understanding and generation, presents an opportunity to address this limitation. This study introduces LLMSecConfig, an innovative framework that bridges this gap by combining SATs with LLMs. Our approach leverages advanced prompting techniques and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automatically repair security misconfigurations while preserving operational functionality. Evaluation of 1,000 real-world Kubernetes configurations achieved a 94\% success rate while maintaining a low rate of introducing new misconfigurations.
  Our work makes a promising step towards automated container security management, reducing the manual effort required for configuration maintenance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Skean, Md Rifat Arefin, Dan Zhao, Niket Patel, Jalal Naghiyev, Yann LeCun, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv</p>
<p>Abstract: From extracting features to generating text, the outputs of large language models (LLMs) typically rely on their final layers, following the conventional wisdom that earlier layers capture only low-level cues. However, our analysis shows that intermediate layers can encode even richer representations, often improving performance on a wide range of downstream tasks. To explain and quantify these hidden-layer properties, we propose a unified framework of representation quality metrics based on information theory, geometry, and invariance to input perturbations. Our framework highlights how each model layer balances information compression and signal preservation, revealing why mid-depth embeddings can exceed the last layer's performance. Through extensive experiments on 32 text-embedding tasks and comparisons across model architectures (transformers, state-space models) and domains (language, vision), we demonstrate that intermediate layers consistently provide stronger features. These findings challenge the standard focus on final-layer embeddings and open new directions for model analysis and optimization, including strategic use of mid-layer representations for more robust and accurate AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohan Zou, Jie Feng, Hao Zhao, Yuanyuan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advances in learning-based methods, finding valid Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamical systems remains challenging. Current neural network approaches face two main issues: challenges in scalable verification and limited interpretability. To address these, we propose an end-to-end framework using transformers to construct analytical Lyapunov functions (local), which simplifies formal verification, enhances interpretability, and provides valuable insights for control engineers. Our framework consists of a transformer-based trainer that generates candidate Lyapunov functions and a falsifier that verifies candidate expressions and refines the model via risk-seeking policy gradient. Unlike Alfarano et al. (2024), which utilizes pre-training and seeks global Lyapunov functions for low-dimensional systems, our model is trained from scratch via reinforcement learning (RL) and succeeds in finding local Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional and non-polynomial systems. Given the analytical nature of the candidates, we employ efficient optimization methods for falsification during training and formal verification tools for the final verification. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a range of nonlinear dynamical systems with up to ten dimensions and show that it can discover Lyapunov functions not previously identified in the control literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Wu, Yuxuan Song, Jingjing Gong, Ziyao Cao, Yawen Ouyang, Jianbing Zhang, Hao Zhou, Wei-Ying Ma, Jingjing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative modeling of crystal data distribution is an important yet challenging task due to the unique periodic physical symmetry of crystals. Diffusion-based methods have shown early promise in modeling crystal distribution. More recently, Bayesian Flow Networks were introduced to aggregate noisy latent variables, resulting in a variance-reduced parameter space that has been shown to be advantageous for modeling Euclidean data distributions with structural constraints (Song et al., 2023). Inspired by this, we seek to unlock its potential for modeling variables located in non-Euclidean manifolds e.g. those within crystal structures, by overcoming challenging theoretical issues. We introduce CrysBFN, a novel crystal generation method by proposing a periodic Bayesian flow, which essentially differs from the original Gaussian-based BFN by exhibiting non-monotonic entropy dynamics. To successfully realize the concept of periodic Bayesian flow, CrysBFN integrates a new entropy conditioning mechanism and empirically demonstrates its significance compared to time-conditioning. Extensive experiments over both crystal ab initio generation and crystal structure prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of CrysBFN, which consistently achieves new state-of-the-art on all benchmarks. Surprisingly, we found that CrysBFN enjoys a significant improvement in sampling efficiency, e.g., ~100x speedup 10 v.s. 2000 steps network forwards) compared with previous diffusion-based methods on MP-20 dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Wang, Bokui Wang, Zhixiang Shen, Boyan Deng, Zhao Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in CV and NLP have inspired researchers to develop general-purpose graph foundation models through pre-training across diverse domains. However, a fundamental challenge arises from the substantial differences in graph topologies across domains. Additionally, real-world graphs are often sparse and prone to noisy connections and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Model (MDGFM), a unified framework that aligns and leverages cross-domain topological information to facilitate robust knowledge transfer. MDGFM bridges different domains by adaptively balancing features and topology while refining original graphs to eliminate noise and align topological structures. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we introduce an efficient prompt-tuning approach. By aligning topologies, MDGFM not only improves multi-domain pre-training but also enables robust knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees of MDGFM's effectiveness and domain generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets validate the robustness and efficacy of our method.</p>

While human vision adapts dynamically to environmental conditions, computational dehazing does not always enhance detection uniformly. We propose a multi-stage framework where a lightweight detector identifies regions of interest (RoIs), which are then enhanced via spatial attention-based dehazing before final detection by a heavier model. Though effective in foggy conditions, this approach unexpectedly degrades the performance on clear images. We analyze this phenomenon, investigate possible causes, and offer insights for designing hybrid pipelines that balance enhancement and detection. Our findings highlight the need for selective preprocessing and challenge assumptions about universal benefits from cascading transformations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research presents an exploration and study of the recipe generation task by fine-tuning various very small language models, with a focus on developing robust evaluation metrics and comparing across different language models the open-ended task of recipe generation. This study presents extensive experiments with multiple model architectures, ranging from T5-small (Raffel et al., 2023) and SmolLM-135M (Allal et al., 2024) to Phi-2 (Research, 2023),implementing both traditional NLP metrics and custom domain-specific evaluation metrics. Our novel evaluation framework incorporates recipe-specific metrics for assessing content quality and introduces an approach to allergen substitution. The results indicate that, while larger models generally perform better on standard metrics, the relationship between model size and recipe quality is more nuanced when considering domain-specific metrics. We find that SmolLM-360M and SmolLM-1.7B demonstrate comparable performance despite their size difference, while Phi-2 shows limitations in recipe generation despite its larger parameter count. Our comprehensive evaluation framework and allergen substitution system provide valuable insights for future work in recipe generation and broader NLG tasks that require domain expertise and safety considerations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In many practical applications, regression models are employed to uncover relationships between predictors and a response variable, yet the common assumption of constant error variance is frequently violated. This issue is further compounded in high-dimensional settings where the number of predictors exceeds the sample size, necessitating regularization for effective estimation and variable selection. To address this problem, we propose the Heteroscedastic Double Bayesian Elastic Net (HDBEN), a novel framework that jointly models the mean and log-variance using hierarchical Bayesian priors incorporating both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ penalties. Our approach simultaneously induces sparsity and grouping in the regression coefficients and variance parameters, capturing complex variance structures in the data. Theoretical results demonstrate that proposed HDBEN achieves posterior concentration, variable selection consistency, and asymptotic normality under mild conditions which justifying its behavior. Simulation studies further illustrate that HDBEN outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios characterized by heteroscedasticity and high dimensionality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Bhendawade, Mahyar Najibi, Devang Naik, Irina Belousova</p>
<p>Abstract: Residual transformations enhance the representational depth and expressive power of large language models (LLMs). However, applying static residual transformations across all tokens in auto-regressive generation leads to a suboptimal trade-off between inference efficiency and generation fidelity. Existing methods, including Early Exiting, Skip Decoding, and Mixture-of-Depth address this by modulating the residual transformation based on token-level complexity. Nevertheless, these approaches predominantly consider the distance traversed by tokens through the model layers, neglecting the underlying velocity of residual evolution. We introduce Mixture of Multi-rate Residuals (M2R2), a framework that dynamically modulates residual velocity to improve early alignment, enhancing inference efficiency. Evaluations on reasoning oriented tasks such as Koala, Self-Instruct, WizardLM, and MT-Bench show M2R2 surpasses state-of-the-art distance-based strategies, balancing generation quality and speedup. In self-speculative decoding setup, M2R2 achieves up to 2.8x speedups on MT-Bench, outperforming methods like 2-model speculative decoding, Medusa, LookAhead Decoding, and DEED. In Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, integrating early residual alignment with ahead-of-time expert loading into high-bandwidth memory (HBM) accelerates decoding, reduces expert-switching bottlenecks, and achieves a 2.9x speedup, making it highly effective in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minwoo Kim, Geunsik Bae, Jinwoo Lee, Woojae Shin, Changseung Kim, Myong-Yol Choi, Heejung Shin, Hyondong Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a learning-based visual planner for agile drone flight in cluttered environments. The proposed planner generates collision-free waypoints in milliseconds, enabling drones to perform agile maneuvers in complex environments without building separate perception, mapping, and planning modules. Learning-based methods, such as behavior cloning (BC) and reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrate promising performance in visual navigation but still face inherent limitations. BC is susceptible to compounding errors due to limited expert imitation, while RL struggles with reward function design and sample inefficiency. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework for high-speed visual navigation. By leveraging IRL, it is possible to reduce the number of interactions with simulation environments and improve capability to deal with high-dimensional spaces while preserving the robustness of RL policies. A motion primitive-based path planning algorithm collects an expert dataset with privileged map data from diverse environments, ensuring comprehensive scenario coverage. By leveraging both the acquired expert and learner dataset gathered from the agent's interactions with the simulation environments, a robust reward function and policy are learned across diverse states. While the proposed method is trained in a simulation environment only, it can be directly applied to real-world scenarios without additional training or tuning. The performance of the proposed method is validated in both simulation and real-world environments, including forests and various structures. The trained policy achieves an average speed of 7 m/s and a maximum speed of 8.8 m/s in real flight experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully apply an IRL framework for high-speed visual navigation of drones.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling and tokenization have driven significant progress in text-to-motion generation, leading to enhanced quality and realism in generated motions. However, effectively leveraging textual information for conditional motion generation remains an open challenge. We observe that current approaches, primarily relying on fixed-length text embeddings (e.g., CLIP) for global semantic injection, struggle to capture the composite nature of human motion, resulting in suboptimal motion quality and controllability. To address this limitation, we propose the Composite Aware Semantic Injection Mechanism (CASIM), comprising a composite-aware semantic encoder and a text-motion aligner that learns the dynamic correspondence between text and motion tokens. Notably, CASIM is model and representation-agnostic, readily integrating with both autoregressive and diffusion-based methods. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT benchmarks demonstrate that CASIM consistently improves motion quality, text-motion alignment, and retrieval scores across state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analyses further highlight the superiority of our composite-aware approach over fixed-length semantic injection, enabling precise motion control from text prompts and stronger generalization to unseen text inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivam Singh, Karthik Swaminathan, Nabanita Dash, Ramandeep Singh, Snehasis Banerjee, Mohan Sridharan, Madhava Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied agents assisting humans are often asked to complete a new task in a new scenario. An agent preparing a particular dish in the kitchen based on a known recipe may be asked to prepare a new dish or to perform cleaning tasks in the storeroom. There may not be sufficient resources, e.g., time or labeled examples, to train the agent for these new situations. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on considerable knowledge across many domains are able to predict a sequence of abstract actions for such new tasks and scenarios, although it may not be possible for the agent to execute this action sequence due to task-, agent-, or domain-specific constraints. Our framework addresses these challenges by leveraging the generic predictions provided by LLM and the prior domain-specific knowledge encoded in a Knowledge Graph (KG), enabling an agent to quickly adapt to new tasks and scenarios. The robot also solicits and uses human input as needed to refine its existing knowledge. Based on experimental evaluation over cooking and cleaning tasks in simulation domains, we demonstrate that the interplay between LLM, KG, and human input leads to substantial performance gains compared with just using the LLM output.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed natural language processing but raises critical concerns about biases inherent in their deployment and use across diverse linguistic and sociocultural contexts. This paper presents a framework named ASCenD BDS (Adaptable, Stochastic and Context-aware framework for Detection of Bias, Discrimination and Stereotyping). The framework presents approach to detecting bias, discrimination, stereotyping across various categories such as gender, caste, age, disability, socioeconomic status, linguistic variations, etc., using an approach which is Adaptive, Stochastic and Context-Aware. The existing frameworks rely heavily on usage of datasets to generate scenarios for detection of Bias, Discrimination and Stereotyping. Examples include datasets such as Civil Comments, Wino Gender, WinoBias, BOLD, CrowS Pairs and BBQ. However, such an approach provides point solutions. As a result, these datasets provide a finite number of scenarios for assessment. The current framework overcomes this limitation by having features which enable Adaptability, Stochasticity, Context Awareness. Context awareness can be customized for any nation or culture or sub-culture (for example an organization's unique culture). In this paper, context awareness in the Indian context has been established. Content has been leveraged from Indian Census 2011 to have a commonality of categorization. A framework has been developed using Category, Sub-Category, STEM, X-Factor, Synonym to enable the features for Adaptability, Stochasticity and Context awareness. The framework has been described in detail in Section 3. Overall 800 plus STEMs, 10 Categories, 31 unique SubCategories were developed by a team of consultants at Saint Fox Consultancy Private Ltd. The concept has been tested out in SFCLabs as part of product development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyong Wang, Jiahang Sun, Mingze Kong, Jize Xie, Qinghua Hu, John C. S. Lui, Zhongxiang Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: The contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a widely used framework for problems requiring sequential decision-making under uncertainty, such as recommendation systems. In applications involving a large number of users, the performance of contextual MAB can be significantly improved by facilitating collaboration among multiple users. This has been achieved by the clustering of bandits (CB) methods, which adaptively group the users into different clusters and achieve collaboration by allowing the users in the same cluster to share data. However, classical CB algorithms typically rely on numerical reward feedback, which may not be practical in certain real-world applications. For instance, in recommendation systems, it is more realistic and reliable to solicit preference feedback between pairs of recommended items rather than absolute rewards. To address this limitation, we introduce the first "clustering of dueling bandit algorithms" to enable collaborative decision-making based on preference feedback. We propose two novel algorithms: (1) Clustering of Linear Dueling Bandits (COLDB) which models the user reward functions as linear functions of the context vectors, and (2) Clustering of Neural Dueling Bandits (CONDB) which uses a neural network to model complex, non-linear user reward functions. Both algorithms are supported by rigorous theoretical analyses, demonstrating that user collaboration leads to improved regret bounds. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets further validate the effectiveness of our methods, establishing their potential in real-world applications involving multiple users with preference-based feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaomeng Yang, Zhiyu Tan, Xuecheng Nie, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Video foundation models have achieved significant advancement with the help of network upgrade as well as model scale-up. However, they are still hard to meet requirements of applications due to unsatisfied generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose to align video foundation models with human preferences from the perspective of post-training in this paper. Consequently, we introduce an Iterative Preference Optimization strategy to enhance generated video quality by incorporating human feedback. Specifically, IPO exploits a critic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct Preference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky Optimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance of signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. In addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large language model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels without need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently perform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the need of tediously manual labeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IPO can effectively improve the video generation quality of a pretrained model and help a model with only 2B parameters surpass the one with 5B parameters. Besides, IPO achieves new state-of-the-art performance on VBench benchmark. We will release our source codes, models as well as dataset to advance future research and applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks may naturally favor distance-based representations, where smaller activations indicate closer proximity to learned prototypes. This contrasts with intensity-based approaches, which rely on activation magnitudes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted experiments with six MNIST architectural variants constrained to learn either distance or intensity representations. Our results reveal that the underlying representation affects model performance. We develop a novel geometric framework that explains these findings and introduce OffsetL2, a new architecture based on Mahalanobis distance equations, to further validate this framework. This work highlights the importance of considering distance-based learning in neural network design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Cheng, Xinxin Song, Ziqian Wang, Qin Zhong, Kunlun He, Jinli Suo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have prompted the development of high-performing early warning score (EWS) systems, predicting clinical deteriorations such as acute kidney injury, acute myocardial infarction, or circulatory failure. DL models have proven to be powerful tools for various tasks but come with the cost of lacking interpretability and limited generalizability, hindering their clinical applications. To develop a practical EWS system applicable to various outcomes, we propose causally-informed explainable early prediction model, which leverages causal discovery to identify the underlying causal relationships of prediction and thus owns two unique advantages: demonstrating the explicit interpretation of the prediction while exhibiting decent performance when applied to unfamiliar environments. Benefiting from these features, our approach achieves superior accuracy for 6 different critical deteriorations and achieves better generalizability across different patient groups, compared to various baseline algorithms. Besides, we provide explicit causal pathways to serve as references for assistant clinical diagnosis and potential interventions. The proposed approach enhances the practical application of deep learning in various medical scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matias D. Cattaneo, Boris Shigida</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern optimization methods used in deep learning, each update depends on the history of previous iterations, often referred to as memory, and this dependence decays fast as the iterates go further into the past. For example, gradient descent with momentum has exponentially decaying memory through exponentially averaged past gradients. We introduce a general technique for identifying a memoryless algorithm that approximates an optimization algorithm with memory. It is obtained by replacing all past iterates in the update by the current one, and then adding a correction term arising from memory (also a function of the current iterate). This correction term can be interpreted as a perturbation of the loss, and the nature of this perturbation can inform how memory implicitly (anti-)regularizes the optimization dynamics. As an application of our theory, we find that Lion does not have the kind of implicit anti-regularization induced by memory that AdamW does, providing a theory-based explanation for Lion's better generalization performance recently documented.</p>

<p>Abstract: The fields of MPC and RL consider two successful control techniques for Markov decision processes. Both approaches are derived from similar fundamental principles, and both are widely used in practical applications, including robotics, process control, energy systems, and autonomous driving. Despite their similarities, MPC and RL follow distinct paradigms that emerged from diverse communities and different requirements. Various technical discrepancies, particularly the role of an environment model as part of the algorithm, lead to methodologies with nearly complementary advantages. Due to their orthogonal benefits, research interest in combination methods has recently increased significantly, leading to a large and growing set of complex ideas leveraging MPC and RL. This work illuminates the differences, similarities, and fundamentals that allow for different combination algorithms and categorizes existing work accordingly. Particularly, we focus on the versatile actor-critic RL approach as a basis for our categorization and examine how the online optimization approach of MPC can be used to improve the overall closed-loop performance of a policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ana Gonzalez Bermudez, Miquel Farreras, Milan Groshev, Jos\'e Antonio Trujillo, Isabel de la Bandera, Raquel Barco</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobility performance has been a key focus in cellular networks up to 5G. To enhance handover (HO) performance, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handover (CHO) and Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM) mechanisms in 5G. While these reactive HO strategies address the trade-off between HO failures (HOF) and ping-pong effects, they often result in inefficient radio resource utilization due to additional HO preparations. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a proactive HO framework for mobility management in O-RAN, leveraging user-cell link predictions to identify the optimal target cell for HO. We explore various categories of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction and analyze the complexity of applying them to the mobility management domain. Two GNN models are compared using a real-world dataset, with experimental results demonstrating their ability to capture the dynamic and graph-structured nature of cellular networks. Finally, we present key insights from our study and outline future steps to enable the integration of GNN-based link prediction for mobility management in 6G networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes ShapeShifter, a new 3D generative model that learns to synthesize shape variations based on a single reference model. While generative methods for 3D objects have recently attracted much attention, current techniques often lack geometric details and/or require long training times and large resources. Our approach remedies these issues by combining sparse voxel grids and point, normal, and color sampling within a multiscale neural architecture that can be trained efficiently and in parallel. We show that our resulting variations better capture the fine details of their original input and can handle more general types of surfaces than previous SDF-based methods. Moreover, we offer interactive generation of 3D shape variants, allowing more human control in the design loop if needed.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution to the Cross-View Isolated Sign Language Recognition (CV-ISLR) challenge held at WWW 2025. CV-ISLR addresses a critical issue in traditional Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR), where existing datasets predominantly capture sign language videos from a frontal perspective, while real-world camera angles often vary. To accurately recognize sign language from different viewpoints, models must be capable of understanding gestures from multiple angles, making cross-view recognition challenging. To address this, we explore the advantages of ensemble learning, which enhances model robustness and generalization across diverse views. Our approach, built on a multi-dimensional Video Swin Transformer model, leverages this ensemble strategy to achieve competitive performance. Finally, our solution ranked 3rd in both the RGB-based ISLR and RGB-D-based ISLR tracks, demonstrating the effectiveness in handling the challenges of cross-view recognition.

<p>Abstract: Signed networks, where edges are labeled as positive or negative to indicate friendly or antagonistic interactions, offer a natural framework for studying polarization, trust, and conflict in social systems. Detecting meaningful group structures in these networks is crucial for understanding online discourse, political division, and trust dynamics. A key challenge is to identify groups that are cohesive internally yet antagonistic externally, while allowing for neutral or unaligned vertices. In this paper, we address this problem by identifying $k$ polarized communities that are large, dense, and balanced in size. We develop an approach based on Frank-Wolfe optimization, leading to a local search procedure with provable convergence guarantees. Our method is both scalable and efficient, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while remaining competitive in terms of computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: In our daily lives, we can naturally convey instructions for the spatial manipulation of objects using words and gestures. Transposing this form of interaction into virtual reality (VR) object manipulation can be beneficial. We propose VR Mover, an LLM-empowered solution that can understand and interpret the user's vocal instruction to support object manipulation. By simply pointing and speaking, the LLM can manipulate objects without structured input. Our user study demonstrates that VR Mover enhances user usability, overall experience and performance on multi-object manipulation, while also reducing workload and arm fatigue. Users prefer the proposed natural interface for broad movements and may complementarily switch to gizmos or virtual hands for finer adjustments. These findings are believed to contribute to design implications for future LLM-based object manipulation interfaces, highlighting the potential for more intuitive and efficient user interactions in VR environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bias evaluation is fundamental to trustworthy AI, both in terms of checking data quality and in terms of checking the outputs of AI systems. In testing data quality, for example, one may study a distance of a given dataset, viewed as a distribution, to a given ground-truth reference dataset. However, classical metrics, such as the Total Variation and the Wasserstein distances, are known to have high sample complexities and, therefore, may fail to provide meaningful distinction in many practical scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose a new notion of distance, the Maximum Subgroup Discrepancy (MSD). In this metric, two distributions are close if, roughly, discrepancies are low for all feature subgroups. While the number of subgroups may be exponential, we show that the sample complexity is linear in the number of features, thus making it feasible for practical applications. Moreover, we provide a practical algorithm for the evaluation of the distance, based on Mixed-integer optimization (MIO). We also note that the proposed distance is easily interpretable, thus providing clearer paths to fixing the biases once they have been identified. It also provides guarantees for all subgroups. Finally, we empirically evaluate, compare with other metrics, and demonstrate the above properties of MSD on real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the groundbreaking success of diffusion models in generating high-fidelity images, their latent space remains relatively under-explored, even though it holds significant promise for enabling versatile and interpretable image editing capabilities. The complicated denoising trajectory and high dimensionality of the latent space make it extremely challenging to interpret. Existing methods mainly explore the feature space of U-Net in Diffusion Models (DMs) instead of the latent space itself. In contrast, we directly investigate the latent space via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and discover three useful properties that can be used to control generation results without the requirements of data collection and maintain identity fidelity generated images. Based on these properties, we propose a novel image editing framework that is capable of learning arbitrary attributes from one pair of latent codes destined by text prompts in Stable Diffusion Models. To validate our approach, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness and flexibility in image editing. We will release our codes soon to foster further research and applications in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract: The vulnerability of 3D point cloud analysis to unpredictable rotations poses an open yet challenging problem: orientation-aware 3D domain generalization. Cross-domain robustness and adaptability of 3D representations are crucial but not easily achieved through rotation augmentation. Motivated by the inherent advantages of intricate orientations in enhancing generalizability, we propose an innovative rotation-adaptive domain generalization framework for 3D point cloud analysis. Our approach aims to alleviate orientational shifts by leveraging intricate samples in an iterative learning process. Specifically, we identify the most challenging rotation for each point cloud and construct an intricate orientation set by optimizing intricate orientations. Subsequently, we employ an orientation-aware contrastive learning framework that incorporates an orientation consistency loss and a margin separation loss, enabling effective learning of categorically discriminative and generalizable features with rotation consistency. Extensive experiments and ablations conducted on 3D cross-domain benchmarks firmly establish the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed approach in the context of orientation-aware 3D domain generalization.</p>

The findings provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, shedding light on their suitability for healthcare applications. Furthermore, the research investigates the robustness of the models in handling diverse patient queries, ranging from general health inquiries to specific medical conditions.

<p>Abstract: In real-world regression tasks, datasets frequently exhibit imbalanced distributions, characterized by a scarcity of data in high-complexity regions and an abundance in low-complexity areas. This imbalance presents significant challenges for existing classification methods with clear class boundaries, while highlighting a scarcity of approaches specifically designed for imbalanced regression problems.

Furthermore, we propose Error Distribution Smoothing (EDS) as a solution to tackle imbalanced regression, effectively selecting a representative subset from the dataset to reduce redundancy while maintaining balance and representativeness.

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient photorealistic novel view synthesis method. However, its reliance on sparse Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point clouds consistently compromises the scene reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel 3D reconstruction framework Gaussian Processes Gaussian Splatting (GP-GS), where a multi-output Gaussian Process model is developed to achieve adaptive and uncertainty-guided densification of sparse SfM point clouds. Specifically, we propose a dynamic sampling and filtering pipeline that adaptively expands the SfM point clouds by leveraging GP-based predictions to infer new candidate points from the input 2D pixels and depth maps. The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the pruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling the generation of dense point clouds.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Lunghi, Yannick Molinghen, Alkis Simitsis, Tom Lenaerts, Gianluca Bontempi</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to data-driven systems, and researchers have spent considerable resources studying them. Despite its economic relevance, this trend largely overlooked the issue of credit card fraud detection. To address this gap, we propose a new threat model that demonstrates the limitations of existing attacks and highlights the necessity to investigate new approaches. We then design a new adversarial attack for credit card fraud detection, employing reinforcement learning to bypass classifiers. This attack, called FRAUD-RLA, is designed to maximize the attacker's reward by optimizing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and working with significantly less required knowledge than competitors. Our experiments, conducted on three different heterogeneous datasets and against two fraud detection systems, indicate that FRAUD-RLA is effective, even considering the severe limitations imposed by our threat model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengda Zhuo, Jiwang Fang, Hongguang Lin, Yin Tang, Min Chen, Changdong Wang, Shuqiang Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significant advantages in handling non-Euclidean data and have been widely applied across various areas, thus receiving increasing attention in recent years. The framework of GNN models mainly includes the information propagation phase and the aggregation phase, treating nodes and edges as information entities and propagation channels, respectively. However, most existing GNN models face the challenge of disconnection between node and edge feature information, as these models typically treat the learning of edge and node features as independent tasks. To address this limitation, we aim to develop an edge-empowered graph feature preference learning framework that can capture edge embeddings to assist node embeddings. By leveraging the learned multidimensional edge feature matrix, we construct multi-channel filters to more effectively capture accurate node features, thereby obtaining the non-local structural characteristics and fine-grained high-order node features. Specifically, the inclusion of multidimensional edge information enhances the functionality and flexibility of the GNN model, enabling it to handle complex and diverse graph data more effectively. Additionally, integrating relational representation learning into the message passing framework allows graph nodes to receive more useful information, thereby facilitating node representation learning. Finally, experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of theproposed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qikang Zhang, Yingjie Lei, Zihao Zheng, Ziyang Chen, Zhonghao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: 4D medical image interpolation is essential for improving temporal resolution and diagnostic precision in clinical applications. Previous works ignore the problem of distribution shifts, resulting in poor generalization under different distribution. A natural solution would be to adapt the model to a new test distribution, but this cannot be done if the test input comes without a ground truth label. In this paper, we propose a novel test time training framework which uses self-supervision to adapt the model to a new distribution without requiring any labels. Indeed, before performing frame interpolation on each test video, the model is trained on the same instance using a self-supervised task, such as rotation prediction or image reconstruction. We conduct experiments on two publicly available 4D medical image interpolation datasets, Cardiac and 4D-Lung. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves significant performance across various evaluation metrics on both datasets. It achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio values, 33.73dB on Cardiac and 34.02dB on 4D-Lung. Our method not only advances 4D medical image interpolation but also provides a template for domain adaptation in other fields such as image segmentation and image registration.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Electrostatic Field Matching (EFM), a novel method that is suitable for both generative modeling and distribution transfer tasks. Our approach is inspired by the physics of an electrical capacitor. We place source and target distributions on the capacitor plates and assign them positive and negative charges, respectively. We then learn the electrostatic field of the capacitor using a neural network approximator. To map the distributions to each other, we start at one plate of the capacitor and move the samples along the learned electrostatic field lines until they reach the other plate. We theoretically justify that this approach provably yields the distribution transfer. In practice, we demonstrate the performance of our EFM in toy and image data experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention for addressing coding problems, but their effectiveness in fixing code maintainability remains unclear. This study evaluates LLMs capability to resolve 127 maintainability issues from 10 GitHub repositories. We use zero-shot prompting for Copilot Chat and Llama 3.1, and few-shot prompting with Llama only. The LLM-generated solutions are assessed for compilation errors, test failures, and new maintainability problems. Llama with few-shot prompting successfully fixed 44.9% of the methods, while Copilot Chat and Llama zero-shot fixed 32.29% and 30%, respectively. However, most solutions introduced errors or new maintainability issues. We also conducted a human study with 45 participants to evaluate the readability of 51 LLM-generated solutions. The human study showed that 68.63% of participants observed improved readability. Overall, while LLMs show potential for fixing maintainability issues, their introduction of errors highlights their current limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaroslav Balytskyi, Inna Hubenko, Alina Balytska, Christopher V. Kelly</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate identification of druggable pockets is essential for structure-based drug design. However, most pocket-identification algorithms prioritize their geometric properties over downstream docking performance. To address this limitation, we developed RAPID-Net, a pocket-finding algorithm for seamless integration with docking workflows. When guiding AutoDock Vina, RAPID-Net outperforms DiffBindFR on the PoseBusters benchmark and enables blind docking on large proteins that AlphaFold 3 cannot process as a whole. Furthermore, RAPID-Net surpasses PUResNet and Kalasanty in docking accuracy and pocket-ligand intersection rates across diverse datasets, including PoseBusters, Astex Diverse Set, BU48, and Coach420. When accuracy is evaluated as ``at least one correct pose in the ensemble'', RAPID-Net outperforms AlphaFold 3 on the PoseBusters benchmark, suggesting that our approach can be further improved with a suitable pose reweighting tool offering a cost-effective and competitive alternative to AlphaFold 3 for docking. Finally, using several therapeutically relevant examples, we demonstrate the ability of RAPID-Net to identify remote functional sites, highlighting its potential to facilitate the development of innovative therapeutics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengbo Gu, Yu-Kun Qiu, Yu-Ming Tang, Ancong Wu, Wei-Shi Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The generation of a virtual digital avatar is a crucial research topic in the field of computer vision. Many existing works utilize Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to address this issue and have achieved impressive results. However, previous works assume the images of the training person are available and fixed while the appearances and poses of a subject could constantly change and increase in real-world scenarios. How to update the human avatar but also maintain the ability to render the old appearance of the person is a practical challenge. One trivial solution is to combine the existing virtual avatar models based on NeRF with continual learning methods. However, there are some critical issues in this approach: learning new appearances and poses can cause the model to forget past information, which in turn leads to a degradation in the rendering quality of past appearances, especially color bleeding issues, and incorrect human body poses. In this work, we propose a maintainable avatar (MaintaAvatar) based on neural radiance fields by continual learning, which resolves the issues by utilizing a Global-Local Joint Storage Module and a Pose Distillation Module. Overall, our model requires only limited data collection to quickly fine-tune the model while avoiding catastrophic forgetting, thus achieving a maintainable virtual avatar. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our MaintaAvatar model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfeng Pan, Senyou Deng, Shaomang Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on LLM technologies is rapidly emerging, with most of them employing a 'fast thinking' approach to inference. Most LLMs generate the final result based solely on a single query and LLM's reasoning capabilities. However, with the advent of OpenAI-o1, 'slow thinking' techniques have garnered increasing attention because its process is closer to the human thought process. Inspired by the human ability to constantly associate and replenish knowledge during thinking, we developed the novel Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts (CoAT) framework, which introduces an innovative synergy between the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm and a dynamic mechanism for integrating new key information, termed 'associative memory'. By combining the structured exploration capabilities of MCTS with the adaptive learning capacity of associative memory, CoAT significantly expands the LLM search space, enabling our framework to explore diverse reasoning pathways and dynamically update its knowledge base in real-time. This allows the framework to not only revisit and refine earlier inferences but also adaptively incorporate evolving information, ensuring that the final output is both accurate and comprehensive. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we conducted extensive experiments across a range of generative and reasoning tasks. These experiments demonstrated that our framework outperforms conventional inference processes on accuracy, coherence, and diversity. The framework's ability to iteratively expand its search space while retaining contextually relevant information results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Bouabdallaoui, Fatima Guerouate, Samya Bouhaddour, Chaimae Saadi, Mohammed Sbihi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce FewTopNER, a novel framework that integrates few-shot named entity recognition (NER) with topic-aware contextual modeling to address the challenges of cross-lingual and low-resource scenarios. FewTopNER leverages a shared multilingual encoder based on XLM-RoBERTa, augmented with language-specific calibration mechanisms, to generate robust contextual embeddings. The architecture comprises a prototype-based entity recognition branch, employing BiLSTM and Conditional Random Fields for sequence labeling, and a topic modeling branch that extracts document-level semantic features through hybrid probabilistic and neural methods. A cross-task bridge facilitates dynamic bidirectional attention and feature fusion between entity and topic representations, thereby enhancing entity disambiguation by incorporating global semantic context. Empirical evaluations on multilingual benchmarks across English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian demonstrate that FewTopNER significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art few-shot NER models. In particular, the framework achieves improvements of 2.5-4.0 percentage points in F1 score and exhibits enhanced topic coherence, as measured by normalized pointwise mutual information. Ablation studies further confirm the critical contributions of the shared encoder and cross-task integration mechanisms to the overall performance. These results underscore the efficacy of incorporating topic-aware context into few-shot NER and highlight the potential of FewTopNER for robust cross-lingual applications in low-resource settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tzu-Tao Chang, Shivaram Venkataraman</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-attention is commonly adopted in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual information into the language backbone. However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique enabling support for longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 5.58$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model merging, a method that combines the parameters and embeddings of multiple fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), offers a promising approach to enhance model performance across various tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper introduces Activation-Informed Merging (AIM), a technique that integrates the information from the activation space of LLMs into the merging process to improve performance and robustness. AIM is designed as a flexible, complementary solution that is applicable to any existing merging method. It aims to preserve critical weights from the base model, drawing on principles from continual learning~(CL) and model compression. Utilizing a task-agnostic calibration set, AIM selectively prioritizes essential weights during merging. We empirically demonstrate that AIM significantly enhances the performance of merged models across multiple benchmarks. Our findings suggest that considering the activation-space information can provide substantial advancements in the model merging strategies for LLMs with up to 40\% increase in benchmark performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning optimization have introduced new algorithms, such as Schedule-Free optimizers, AdEMAMix, MARS and Lion which modify traditional momentum mechanisms. In a separate line of work, theoretical acceleration of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in noise-dominated regime has been achieved by decoupling the momentum coefficient from the current gradient's weight. In this paper, we establish explicit connections between these two lines of work. We substantiate our theoretical findings with preliminary experiments on a 150m language modeling task. We find that AdEMAMix, which most closely resembles accelerated versions of stochastic gradient descent, exhibits superior performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a modification to AdEMAMix, termed Simplified-AdEMAMix, which maintains the same performance as AdEMAMix across both large and small batch-size settings while eliminating the need for two different momentum terms. The code for Simplified-AdEMAMix is available on the repository: https://github.com/DepenM/Simplified-AdEMAMix/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaling Shen, Zhixiong Zhuang, Kun Yuan, Maria-Irina Nicolae, Nassir Navab, Nicolas Padoy, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are becoming an instrumental part of healthcare systems, assisting medical personnel with decision making and results analysis. Models for radiology report generation are able to interpret medical imagery, thus reducing the workload of radiologists. As medical data is scarce and protected by privacy regulations, medical MLLMs represent valuable intellectual property. However, these assets are potentially vulnerable to model stealing, where attackers aim to replicate their functionality via black-box access. So far, model stealing for the medical domain has focused on classification; however, existing attacks are not effective against MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce Adversarial Domain Alignment (ADA-STEAL), the first stealing attack against medical MLLMs. ADA-STEAL relies on natural images, which are public and widely available, as opposed to their medical counterparts. We show that data augmentation with adversarial noise is sufficient to overcome the data distribution gap between natural images and the domain-specific distribution of the victim MLLM. Experiments on the IU X-RAY and MIMIC-CXR radiology datasets demonstrate that Adversarial Domain Alignment enables attackers to steal the medical MLLM without any access to medical data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 with Extended Reality (XR) technologies offers the potential to build truly immersive XR environments that interact with human users through natural language, e.g., generating and animating 3D scenes from audio inputs. However, the complexity of XR environments makes it difficult to accurately extract relevant contextual data and scene/object parameters from an overwhelming volume of XR artifacts. It leads to not only increased costs with pay-per-use models, but also elevated levels of generation errors. Moreover, existing approaches focusing on coding script generation are often prone to generation errors, resulting in flawed or invalid scripts, application crashes, and ultimately a degraded user experience. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LLMER, a novel framework that creates interactive XR worlds using JSON data generated by LLMs. Unlike prior approaches focusing on coding script generation, LLMER translates natural language inputs into JSON data, significantly reducing the likelihood of application crashes and processing latency. It employs a multi-stage strategy to supply only the essential contextual information adapted to the user's request and features multiple modules designed for various XR tasks. Our preliminary user study reveals the effectiveness of the proposed system, with over 80% reduction in consumed tokens and around 60% reduction in task completion time compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The analysis of users' feedback also illuminates a series of directions for further optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Values are core drivers of individual and collective perception, cognition, and behavior. Value systems, such as Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, delineate the hierarchy and interplay among these values, enabling cross-disciplinary investigations into decision-making and societal dynamics. Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding their elusive intrinsic values. Despite growing efforts in evaluating, understanding, and aligning LLM values, a psychologically grounded LLM value system remains underexplored. This study addresses the gap by introducing the Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach (GPLA), a scalable, adaptable, and theoretically informed method for constructing value systems. Leveraging GPLA, we propose a psychologically grounded five-factor value system tailored for LLMs. For systematic validation, we present three benchmarking tasks that integrate psychological principles with cutting-edge AI priorities. Our results reveal that the proposed value system meets standard psychological criteria, better captures LLM values, improves LLM safety prediction, and enhances LLM alignment, when compared to the canonical Schwartz's values.</p>

This paper presents the first successful demonstration of this concept, showing that a computational model can accurately predict the outcomes of two human A/B experiments -- one testing a problem sequencing intervention and the other testing an item design intervention. It also demonstrates that such a model can generate learning curves without requiring human data and provide theoretical insights into why an instructional intervention is effective.

<p>Abstract: An approach to improve neural network interpretability is via clusterability, i.e., splitting a model into disjoint clusters that can be studied independently. We define a measure for clusterability and show that pre-trained models form highly enmeshed clusters via spectral graph clustering. We thus train models to be more modular using a ``clusterability loss'' function that encourages the formation of non-interacting clusters. Using automated interpretability techniques, we show that our method can help train models that are more modular and learn different, disjoint, and smaller circuits. We investigate CNNs trained on MNIST and CIFAR, small transformers trained on modular addition, and language models. Our approach provides a promising direction for training neural networks that learn simpler functions and are easier to interpret.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have transformed computer vision, driving significant performance improvements across diverse domains, including digital histopathology. However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Ellis, Andrew Bulpitt, Nasim Parsa, Michael F Byrne, Sharib Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is clinically invaluable due to its noninvasive and safe nature. However, interpreting US images is challenging, requires significant expertise, and time, and is often prone to errors. Deep learning offers assistive solutions such as segmentation. Supervised methods rely on large, high-quality, and consistently labeled datasets, which are challenging to curate. Moreover, these methods tend to underperform on out-of-distribution data, limiting their clinical utility. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging unlabeled data to enhance model performance and generalisability. We introduce a contrastive SSL approach tailored for B-mode US images, incorporating a novel Relation Contrastive Loss (RCL). RCL encourages learning of distinct features by differentiating positive and negative sample pairs through a learnable metric. Additionally, we propose spatial and frequency-based augmentation strategies for the representation learning on US images. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional supervised segmentation methods across three public breast US datasets, particularly in data-limited scenarios. Notable improvements on the Dice similarity metric include a 4% increase on 20% and 50% of the BUSI dataset, nearly 6% and 9% improvements on 20% and 50% of the BrEaST dataset, and 6.4% and 3.7% improvements on 20% and 50% of the UDIAT dataset, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate superior generalisability on the out-of-distribution UDIAT dataset with performance boosts of 20.6% and 13.6% compared to the supervised baseline using 20% and 50% of the BUSI and BrEaST training data, respectively. Our research highlights that domain-inspired SSL can improve US segmentation, especially under data-limited conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Causal Effect (CE) is a numerical measure of causal influence of variables on observed results. Despite being widely used in many areas, only preliminary attempts have been made to use CE as an attribution score in data management, to measure the causal strength of tuples for query answering in databases. In this work, we introduce, generalize and investigate the so-called Causal-Effect Score in the context of classical and probabilistic databases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruochen Li, Tanqiu Qiao, Stamos Katsigiannis, Zhanxing Zhu, Hubert P. H. Shum</p>
<p>Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction aims to forecast future movements based on historical paths. Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation. UniEdge outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple datasets, including ETH, UCY, and SDD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maohao Shen, Guangtao Zeng, Zhenting Qi, Zhang-Wei Hong, Zhenfang Chen, Wei Lu, Gregory Wornell, Subhro Das, David Cox, Chuang Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Recent studies have shown that increasing test-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This typically involves extensive sampling at inference time guided by an external LLM verifier, resulting in a two-player system. Despite external guidance, the effectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to tackle complex tasks. Thus, we pose a new research problem: Can we internalize the searching capabilities to fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of a single LLM? This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on post-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning process with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies). To achieve this, we propose the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm: 1) a small-scale format tuning stage to internalize the COAT reasoning format and 2) a large-scale self-improvement stage leveraging reinforcement learning. Our approach results in Satori, a 7B LLM trained on open-source models and data. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Satori achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessio Russo, Aldo Pacchiano</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the policy evaluation problem in an online multi-reward multi-policy discounted setting, where multiple reward functions must be evaluated simultaneously for different policies. We adopt an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC perspective to achieve $\epsilon$-accurate estimates with high confidence across finite or convex sets of rewards, a setting that has not been investigated in the literature. Building on prior work on Multi-Reward Best Policy Identification, we adapt the MR-NaS exploration scheme to jointly minimize sample complexity for evaluating different policies across different reward sets. Our approach leverages an instance-specific lower bound revealing how the sample complexity scales with a measure of value deviation, guiding the design of an efficient exploration policy. Although computing this bound entails a hard non-convex optimization, we propose an efficient convex approximation that holds for both finite and convex reward sets. Experiments in tabular domains demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive exploration scheme.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Rose Kirk, Iason Gabriel, Chris Summerfield, Bertie Vidgen, Scott A. Hale</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans strive to design safe AI systems that align with our goals and remain under our control. However, as AI capabilities advance, we face a new challenge: the emergence of deeper, more persistent relationships between humans and AI systems. We explore how increasingly capable AI agents may generate the perception of deeper relationships with users, especially as AI becomes more personalised and agentic. This shift, from transactional interaction to ongoing sustained social engagement with AI, necessitates a new focus on socioaffective alignment-how an AI system behaves within the social and psychological ecosystem co-created with its user, where preferences and perceptions evolve through mutual influence. Addressing these dynamics involves resolving key intrapersonal dilemmas, including balancing immediate versus long-term well-being, protecting autonomy, and managing AI companionship alongside the desire to preserve human social bonds. By framing these challenges through a notion of basic psychological needs, we seek AI systems that support, rather than exploit, our fundamental nature as social and emotional beings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Zhou, Xingchen Wan, Ruoxi Sun, Hamid Palangi, Shariq Iqbal, Ivan Vuli\'c, Anna Korhonen, Sercan \"O. Ar{\i}k</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models, employed as multiple agents that interact and collaborate with each other, have excelled at solving complex tasks. The agents are programmed with prompts that declare their functionality, along with the topologies that orchestrate interactions across agents. Designing prompts and topologies for multi-agent systems (MAS) is inherently complex. To automate the entire design process, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the design space aiming to understand the factors behind building effective MAS. We reveal that prompts together with topologies play critical roles in enabling more effective MAS design. Based on the insights, we propose Multi-Agent System Search (MASS), a MAS optimization framework that efficiently exploits the complex MAS design space by interleaving its optimization stages, from local to global, from prompts to topologies, over three stages: 1) block-level (local) prompt optimization; 2) workflow topology optimization; 3) workflow-level (global) prompt optimization, where each stage is conditioned on the iteratively optimized prompts/topologies from former stages. We show that MASS-optimized multi-agent systems outperform a spectrum of existing alternatives by a substantial margin. Based on the MASS-found systems, we finally propose design principles behind building effective multi-agent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present flow Q-learning (FQL), a simple and performant offline reinforcement learning (RL) method that leverages an expressive flow-matching policy to model arbitrarily complex action distributions in data. Training a flow policy with RL is a tricky problem, due to the iterative nature of the action generation process. We address this challenge by training an expressive one-step policy with RL, rather than directly guiding an iterative flow policy to maximize values. This way, we can completely avoid unstable recursive backpropagation, eliminate costly iterative action generation at test time, yet still mostly maintain expressivity. We experimentally show that FQL leads to strong performance across 73 challenging state- and pixel-based OGBench and D4RL tasks in offline RL and offline-to-online RL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Wu, Changkyu Choi, Xiangcheng Cao, Volkan Cevher, Ali Ramezani-Kebrya</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of minimizing true risk in multi-node distributed learning. These systems are frequently exposed to both inter-node and intra-node label shifts, which present a critical obstacle to effectively optimizing model performance while ensuring that data remains confined to each node. To tackle this, we propose the Versatile Robust Label Shift (VRLS) method, which enhances the maximum likelihood estimation of the test-to-train label density ratio. VRLS incorporates Shannon entropy-based regularization and adjusts the density ratio during training to better handle label shifts at the test time. In multi-node learning environments, VRLS further extends its capabilities by learning and adapting density ratios across nodes, effectively mitigating label shifts and improving overall model performance. Experiments conducted on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate the effectiveness of VRLS, outperforming baselines by up to 20% in imbalanced settings. These results highlight the significant improvements VRLS offers in addressing label shifts. Our theoretical analysis further supports this by establishing high-probability bounds on estimation errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayan Kiyani, George Pappas, Aaron Roth, Hamed Hassani</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental question in data-driven decision making is how to quantify the uncertainty of predictions in ways that can usefully inform downstream action. This interface between prediction uncertainty and decision-making is especially important in risk-sensitive domains, such as medicine. In this paper, we develop decision-theoretic foundations that connect uncertainty quantification using prediction sets with risk-averse decision-making. Specifically, we answer three fundamental questions: (1) What is the correct notion of uncertainty quantification for risk-averse decision makers? We prove that prediction sets are optimal for decision makers who wish to optimize their value at risk. (2) What is the optimal policy that a risk averse decision maker should use to map prediction sets to actions? We show that a simple max-min decision policy is optimal for risk-averse decision makers. Finally, (3) How can we derive prediction sets that are optimal for such decision makers? We provide an exact characterization in the population regime and a distribution free finite-sample construction. Answering these questions naturally leads to an algorithm, Risk-Averse Calibration (RAC), which follows a provably optimal design for deriving action policies from predictions. RAC is designed to be both practical-capable of leveraging the quality of predictions in a black-box manner to enhance downstream utility-and safe-adhering to a user-defined risk threshold and optimizing the corresponding risk quantile of the user's downstream utility. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the significant advantages of RAC in applications such as medical diagnosis and recommendation systems. Specifically, we show that RAC achieves a substantially improved trade-off between safety and utility, offering higher utility compared to existing methods while maintaining the safety guarantee.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyang Xie, Yong Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Survival analysis, a vital tool for predicting the time to event, has been used in many domains such as healthcare, criminal justice, and finance. Like classification tasks, survival analysis can exhibit bias against disadvantaged groups, often due to biases inherent in data or algorithms. Several studies in both the IS and CS communities have attempted to address fairness in survival analysis. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of prediction fairness at pre-defined evaluation time points, which is crucial in real-world applications where decision making often hinges on specific time frames. To address this critical research gap, we introduce a new fairness concept: equalized odds (EO) in survival analysis, which emphasizes prediction fairness at pre-defined time points. To achieve the EO fairness in survival analysis, we propose a Conditional Mutual Information Augmentation (CMIA) approach, which features a novel fairness regularization term based on conditional mutual information and an innovative censored data augmentation technique. Our CMIA approach can effectively balance prediction accuracy and fairness, and it is applicable to various survival models. We evaluate the CMIA approach against several state-of-the-art methods within three different application domains, and the results demonstrate that CMIA consistently reduces prediction disparity while maintaining good accuracy and significantly outperforms the other competing methods across multiple datasets and survival models (e.g., linear COX, deep AFT).</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across numerous fields, presenting an opportunity to revolutionize optimization problem-solving, a crucial, ubiquitous, and complex domain. This paper explores the proficiency of LLMs in handling Sequential Optimization Problems (SOPs). We introduce WorldGen, a dynamic framework for generating unseen SOPs with controllable complexities, to evaluate LLM performance. Our initial observations reveal that while LLMs perform well on simple SOPs, their performance significantly degrades with increased complexity. Motivated by this, we revisit philosophical hypotheses on reasoning to enhance LLM performance. Inspired by the influential framework of Hegelian Dialectics, we propose ACE, demonstrating how the performance of LLMs in SOP contexts can be significantly improved without any retraining or further fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyu Lin, Yao Tang, Xingcheng Yao, Da Yin, Ziniu Hu, Yizhou Sun, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language agents have become a promising solution to complex interactive tasks. One of the key ingredients to the success of language agents is the reward model on the trajectory of the agentic workflow, which provides valuable guidance during training or inference. However, due to the lack of annotations of intermediate interactions, most existing works use an outcome reward model to optimize policies across entire trajectories. This may lead to sub-optimal policies and hinder the overall performance. To address this, we propose QLASS (Q-guided Language Agent Stepwise Search), to automatically generate annotations by estimating Q-values in a stepwise manner for open language agents. By introducing a reasoning tree and performing process reward modeling, QLASS provides effective intermediate guidance for each step. With the stepwise guidance, we propose a Q-guided generation strategy to enable language agents to better adapt to long-term value, resulting in significant performance improvement during model inference on complex interactive agent tasks. Notably, even with almost half the annotated data, QLASS retains strong performance, demonstrating its efficiency in handling limited supervision. We also empirically demonstrate that QLASS can lead to more effective decision making through qualitative analysis. We will release our code and data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Though numerous solvers have been proposed for the MaxSAT problem, and the benchmark environment such as MaxSAT Evaluations provides a platform for the comparison of the state-of-the-art solvers, existing assessments were usually evaluated based on the quality, e.g., fitness, of the best-found solutions obtained within a given running time budget. However, concerning solely the final obtained solutions regarding specific time budgets may restrict us from comprehending the behavior of the solvers along the convergence process. This paper demonstrates that Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions can be used to compare MaxSAT stochastic local search solvers' anytime performance across multiple problem instances and various time budgets. The assessment reveals distinctions in solvers' performance and displays that the (dis)advantages of solvers adjust along different running times. This work also exhibits that the quantitative and high variance assessment of anytime performance can guide machines, i.e., automatic configurators, to search for better parameter settings. Our experimental results show that the hyperparameter optimization tool, i.e., SMAC, can achieve better parameter settings of solvers when using the anytime performance as the cost function, compared to using the metrics based on the fitness of the best-found solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: The global cost of drug discovery and development exceeds $200 billion annually, with clinical trial outcomes playing a critical role in the regulatory approval of new drugs and impacting patient outcomes. Despite their significance, large-scale, high-quality clinical trial outcome data are not readily available to the public, limiting advances in trial outcome predictive modeling.
  Methods: We introduce the Clinical Trial Outcome (CTO) knowledge base, a fully reproducible, large-scale (around 125K drug and biologics trials), open-source of clinical trial information including large language model (LLM) interpretations of publications, matched trials over phases, sentiment analysis from news, stock prices of trial sponsors, and other trial-related metrics. From this knowledge base, we additionally performed manual annotation of a set of recent clinical trials from 2020-2024.
  Results: We evaluated the quality of our knowledge base by generating high-quality trial outcome labels that demonstrate strong agreement with previously published expert annotations, achieving an F1 score of 94 for Phase 3 trials and 91 across all phases. Additionally, we benchmarked a suite of standard machine learning models on our manually annotated set, highlighting the distribution shift of recent trials and the need for continuously updated labeling methods.
  Conclusions: By analyzing CTO's performance on recent trials, we showed a need for recent, high-quality trial outcome labels. We release our knowledge base and labels to the public at https://chufangao.github.io/CTOD, which will also be regularly updated to support ongoing research in clinical trial outcomes, offering insights that could optimize the drug development process.</p>

<p>Abstract: The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) and its solution algorithms have been of enduring interest in both academia and industry for decades. In recent years, machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role in advancing existing and building new heuristic solutions for the JSSP, aiming to find better solutions in shorter computation times. In this paper we build on top of a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, called Neural Local Search (NLS), which can efficiently and effectively control a large local neighborhood search on the JSSP. In particular, we develop a method for training the decision transformer (DT) algorithm on search trajectories taken by a trained NLS agent to further improve upon the learned decision-making sequences. Our experiments show that the DT successfully learns local search strategies that are different and, in many cases, more effective than those of the NLS agent itself. In terms of the tradeoff between solution quality and acceptable computational time needed for the search, the DT is particularly superior in application scenarios where longer computational times are acceptable. In this case, it makes up for the longer inference times required per search step, which are caused by the larger neural network architecture, through better quality decisions per step. Thereby, the DT achieves state-of-the-art results for solving the JSSP with ML-enhanced search.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic chart understanding is crucial for content comprehension and document parsing. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding through domain-specific alignment and fine-tuning. However, the application of alignment training within the chart domain is still underexplored. To address this, we propose ChartMoE, which employs the mixture of expert (MoE) architecture to replace the traditional linear projector to bridge the modality gap. Specifically, we train multiple linear connectors through distinct alignment tasks, which are utilized as the foundational initialization parameters for different experts. Additionally, we introduce ChartMoE-Align, a dataset with over 900K chart-table-JSON-code quadruples to conduct three alignment tasks (chart-table/JSON/code). Combined with the vanilla connector, we initialize different experts in four distinct ways and adopt high-quality knowledge learning to further refine the MoE connector and LLM parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MoE connector and our initialization strategy, e.g., ChartMoE improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art from 80.48% to 84.64% on the ChartQA benchmark.</p>

However, existing research focuses on the optimal performance on the target problem as the sole objective, neglecting other criteria such as efficiency and scalability, which are vital in practice. To tackle this challenge, we propose to model the heuristic search as a multi-objective optimization problem and consider introducing additional practical criteria beyond optimal performance. Due to the complexity of the search space, conventional multi-objective optimization methods struggle to effectively handle LLM-based multi-objective heuristic search. We propose the first LLM-based multi-objective heuristic search framework, Multi-objective Evolution of Heuristic (MEoH), which integrates LLMs in a zero-shot manner to generate a non-dominated set of heuristics to meet multiple design criteria. We design a new dominance-dissimilarity mechanism for effective population management and selection, which incorporates both code dissimilarity in the search space and dominance in the objective space. MEoH is demonstrated in two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: the online Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The results indicate that a variety of elite heuristics are automatically generated in a single run, offering more trade-off options than the existing methods. It successfully achieves competitive or superior performance while improving efficiency up to 10 times. Moreover, we also observe that the multi-objective search introduces novel insights into heuristic design and leads to the discovery of diverse heuristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Yang, Jiaoyan Chen, Uli Sattler</p>
<p>Abstract: OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies, which are able to represent both relational and type facts as standard knowledge graphs and complex domain knowledge in Description Logic (DL) axioms, are widely adopted in domains such as healthcare and bioinformatics. Inspired by the success of knowledge graph embeddings, embedding OWL ontologies has gained significant attention in recent years. Current methods primarily focus on learning embeddings for atomic concepts and roles, enabling the evaluation based on normalized axioms through specially designed score functions. However, they often neglect the embedding of complex concepts, making it difficult to infer with more intricate axioms. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in advanced reasoning tasks, such as Ontology Learning and ontology-mediated Query Answering. In this paper, we propose EL++-closed ontology embeddings which are able to represent any logical expressions in DL via composition. Furthermore, we develop TransBox, an effective EL++-closed ontology embedding method that can handle many-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that TransBox often achieves state-of-the-art performance across various real-world datasets for predicting complex axioms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning Dai, Zheng Wu, Renjie Zheng, Ziyun Wei, Wenlei Shi, Xing Jin, Guanlin Liu, Chen Dun, Liang Huang, Lin Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with unit test feedback has enhanced large language models' (LLMs) code generation, but relies on sparse rewards provided only after complete code evaluation, limiting learning efficiency and incremental improvements. When generated code fails all unit tests, no learning signal is received, hindering progress on complex tasks. To address this, we propose a Process Reward Model (PRM) that delivers dense, line-level feedback on code correctness during generation, mimicking human code refinement and providing immediate guidance. We explore various strategies for training PRMs and integrating them into the RL framework, finding that using PRMs both as dense rewards and for value function initialization significantly boosts performance. Our experimental results also highlight the effectiveness of PRMs in enhancing RL-driven code generation, especially for long-horizon scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a benchmark to pressure-test today's frontier models' multimodal decision-making capabilities in the very long-context regime (up to one million tokens) and investigate whether these models can learn from large numbers of expert demonstrations in their context. We evaluate the performance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and o1 as policies across a battery of simple interactive decision-making tasks: playing tic-tac-toe, chess, and Atari, navigating grid worlds, solving crosswords, and controlling a simulated cheetah. We study increasing amounts of expert demonstrations in the context $\unicode{x2013}$ from no demonstrations to 512 full episodes. Across our tasks, models rarely manage to fully reach expert performance, and often, presenting more demonstrations has little effect. Some models steadily improve with more demonstrations on a few tasks. We investigate the effect of encoding observations as text or images and the impact of chain-of-thought prompting. To help quantify the impact of other approaches and future innovations, we open source our benchmark that covers the zero-, few-, and many-shot regimes in a unified evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditi Singh, Abul Ehtesham, Saket Kumar, Tala Talaei Khoei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling human like text generation and natural language understanding. However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management.
  Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications.
  This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14304">MASTER: A Multi-Agent System with LLM Specialized MCTS</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingzheng Gan, Yufan Zhao, Tianyi Zhang, Jing Huang, Yusu Li, Shu Xian Teo, Changwang Zhang, Wei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being explored for problem-solving tasks. However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, which leads to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot yield an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present the Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication through LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. It achieves 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Local search preprocessing makes Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers faster by providing high-quality starting points and modern SAT solvers have incorporated this technique into their preprocessing steps. However, these tools rely on basic strategies that miss the structural patterns in problems. We present a method that applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Python-based encoding code. This reveals hidden structural patterns in how problems convert into SAT. Our method automatically generates specialized local search algorithms that find these patterns and use them to create strong initial assignments. This works for any problem instance from the same encoding type. Our tests show encouraging results, achieving faster solving times compared to baseline preprocessing systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Clovis Varangot-Reille, Christophe Bouvard, Antoine Gourru, Mathieu Ciancone, Marion Schaeffer, Fran\c{c}ois Jacquenet</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM)-based systems, i.e. interconnected elements that include an LLM as a central component (e.g., conversational agents), are typically monolithic static architectures that rely on a single LLM for all user queries. However, they often require different preprocessing strategies, levels of reasoning, or knowledge. Generalist LLMs (e.g. GPT-4) trained on very large multi-topic corpora can perform well in a variety of tasks. They require significant financial, energy, and hardware resources that may not be justified for basic tasks. This implies potentially investing in unnecessary costs for a given query. To overcome this problem, a routing mechanism routes user queries to the most suitable components, such as smaller LLMs or experts in specific topics. This approach may improve response quality while minimising costs. Routing can be expanded to other components of the conversational agent architecture, such as the selection of optimal embedding strategies. This paper explores key considerations for integrating routing into LLM-based systems, focusing on resource management, cost definition, and strategy selection. Our main contributions include a formalisation of the problem, a novel taxonomy of existing approaches emphasising relevance and resource efficiency, and a comparative analysis of these strategies in relation to industry practices. Finally, we identify critical challenges and directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Schoeffer, Johannes Jakubik, Michael Voessing, Niklas Kuehl, Gerhard Satzger</p>
<p>Abstract: In AI-assisted decision-making, a central promise of having a human-in-the-loop is that they should be able to complement the AI system by overriding its wrong recommendations. In practice, however, we often see that humans cannot assess the correctness of AI recommendations and, as a result, adhere to wrong or override correct advice. Different ways of relying on AI recommendations have immediate, yet distinct, implications for decision quality. Unfortunately, reliance and decision quality are often inappropriately conflated in the current literature on AI-assisted decision-making. In this work, we disentangle and formalize the relationship between reliance and decision quality, and we characterize the conditions under which human-AI complementarity is achievable. To illustrate how reliance and decision quality relate to one another, we propose a visual framework and demonstrate its usefulness for interpreting empirical findings, including the effects of interventions like explanations. Overall, our research highlights the importance of distinguishing between reliance behavior and decision quality in AI-assisted decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ga\v{s}per Begu\v{s}, Maksymilian D\k{a}bkowski, Ryan Rhodes</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) has recently improved to the point where the models can perform well on many language tasks. We show here that -- for the first time -- the models can also generate valid metalinguistic analyses of language data. We outline a research program where the behavioral interpretability of LLMs on these tasks is tested via prompting. LLMs are trained primarily on text -- as such, evaluating their metalinguistic abilities improves our understanding of their general capabilities and sheds new light on theoretical models in linguistics. We show that OpenAI's o1 vastly outperforms other models on tasks involving drawing syntactic trees and phonological generalization. We speculate that OpenAI o1's unique advantage over other models may result from the model's chain-of-thought mechanism, which mimics the structure of human reasoning used in complex cognitive tasks, such as linguistic analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunyong Ko, Seongeun Ryu, Sang-Wook Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized news recommendation aims to assist users in finding news articles that align with their interests, which plays a pivotal role in mitigating users' information overload problem. Although many recent works have been studied for better personalized news recommendation, the following challenges should be explored more: (C1) Comprehending manifold intents coupled within a news article, (C2) Differentiating varying post-read preferences of news articles, and (C3) Addressing the cold-start user problem. To tackle the aforementioned challenges together, in this paper, we propose a novel personalized news recommendation framework (CROWN) that employs (1) category-guided intent disentanglement for (C1), (2) consistency-based news representation for (C2), and (3) GNN-enhanced hybrid user representation for (C3). Furthermore, we incorporate a category prediction into the training process of CROWN as an auxiliary task, which provides supplementary supervisory signals to enhance intent disentanglement. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets reveal that (1) CROWN provides consistent performance improvements over ten state-of-the-art news recommendation methods and (2) the proposed strategies significantly improve the accuracy of CROWN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh T. Hoang, Zsolt J. Viharos</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful tool for extracting valuable information and making various predictions from diverse datasets. Traditional machine learning algorithms rely on well-defined input and output variables; however, there are scenarios where the separation between the input and output variables and the underlying, associated input and output layers of the model are unknown. Feature Selection (FS) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have emerged as promising solutions in such scenarios. This paper proposes MICS-EFS, a Model Input-Output Configuration Search with Embedded Feature Selection. The methodology explores internal dependencies in the complete input parameter space for classification tasks involving both 1D sensor time-series and 2D image data. MICS-EFS employs a modified encoder-decoder model and the Sequential Forward Search (SFS) algorithm, combining input-output configuration search with embedded feature selection. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MICS-EFS compared to other FS algorithms. Across all tested datasets, MICS-EFS delivered an average accuracy improvement of 1.5% over baseline models, with the accuracy gains ranging from 0.5% to 5.9%. Moreover, the algorithm reduced feature dimensionality to just 2-5% of the original data, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. These results highlight the potential of MICS-EFS to improve model accuracy and efficiency in various machine learning tasks. Furthermore, the proposed method has been validated in a real-world industrial application focused on machining processes, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality in addressing complex input-output challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: It is often argued that effective human-centered explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) should resemble human reasoning. However, empirical investigations of how concepts from cognitive science can aid the design of XAI are lacking. Based on insights from cognitive science, we propose a framework of explanatory modes to analyze how people frame explanations, whether mechanistic, teleological, or counterfactual. Using the complex safety-critical domain of autonomous driving, we conduct an experiment consisting of two studies on (i) how people explain the behavior of a vehicle in 14 unique scenarios (N1=54) and (ii) how they perceive these explanations (N2=382), curating the novel Human Explanations for Autonomous Driving Decisions (HEADD) dataset. Our main finding is that participants deem teleological explanations significantly better quality than counterfactual ones, with perceived teleology being the best predictor of perceived quality. Based on our results, we argue that explanatory modes are an important axis of analysis when designing and evaluating XAI and highlight the need for a principled and empirically grounded understanding of the cognitive mechanisms of explanation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitris Bertsimas, Vassilis Digalakis Jr, Yu Ma, Phevos Paschalidis</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of retraining machine learning (ML) models when new batches of data become available. Existing approaches greedily optimize for predictive power independently at each batch, without considering the stability of the model's structure or analytical insights across retraining iterations. We propose a model-agnostic framework for finding sequences of models that are stable across retraining iterations. We develop a mixed-integer optimization formulation that is guaranteed to recover Pareto optimal models (in terms of the predictive power-stability trade-off) with good generalization properties, as well as an efficient polynomial-time algorithm that performs well in practice. We focus on retaining consistent analytical insights-which is important to model interpretability, ease of implementation, and fostering trust with users-by using custom-defined distance metrics that can be directly incorporated into the optimization problem. We evaluate our framework across models (regression, decision trees, boosted trees, and neural networks) and application domains (healthcare, vision, and language), including deployment in a production pipeline at a major US hospital. We find that, on average, a 2% reduction in predictive power leads to a 30% improvement in stability.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, software systems powered by deep learning (DL) techniques have significantly facilitated people's lives in many aspects. As the backbone of these DL systems, various DL libraries undertake the underlying optimization and computation. However, like traditional software, DL libraries are not immune to bugs, which can pose serious threats to users' personal property and safety. Studying the characteristics of DL libraries, their associated bugs, and the corresponding testing methods is crucial for enhancing the security of DL systems and advancing the widespread application of DL technology. This paper provides an overview of the testing research related to various DL libraries, discusses the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, and provides guidance and reference for the application of the DL library. This paper first introduces the workflow of DL underlying libraries and the characteristics of three kinds of DL libraries involved, namely DL framework, DL compiler, and DL hardware library. It then provides definitions for DL underlying library bugs and testing. Additionally, this paper summarizes the existing testing methods and tools tailored to these DL libraries separately and analyzes their effectiveness and limitations. It also discusses the existing challenges of DL library testing and outlines potential directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maya Anderson, Guy Amit, Abigail Goldsteen</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have shown great promise in natural language processing. However, their reliance on data stored in a retrieval database, which may contain proprietary or sensitive information, introduces new privacy concerns. Specifically, an attacker may be able to infer whether a certain text passage appears in the retrieval database by observing the outputs of the RAG system, an attack known as a Membership Inference Attack (MIA). Despite the significance of this threat, MIAs against RAG systems have yet remained under-explored. This study addresses this gap by introducing an efficient and easy-to-use method for conducting MIA against RAG systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack using two benchmark datasets and multiple generative models, showing that the membership of a document in the retrieval database can be efficiently determined through the creation of an appropriate prompt in both black-box and gray-box settings. Moreover, we introduce an initial defense strategy based on adding instructions to the RAG template, which shows high effectiveness for some datasets and models. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing security countermeasures in deployed RAG systems and developing more advanced defenses to protect the privacy and security of retrieval databases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Schlaginhaufen, Maryam Kamgarpour</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to infer a reward from expert demonstrations, motivated by the idea that the reward, rather than the policy, is the most succinct and transferable description of a task [Ng et al., 2000]. However, the reward corresponding to an optimal policy is not unique, making it unclear if an IRL-learned reward is transferable to new transition laws in the sense that its optimal policy aligns with the optimal policy corresponding to the expert's true reward. Past work has addressed this problem only under the assumption of full access to the expert's policy, guaranteeing transferability when learning from two experts with the same reward but different transition laws that satisfy a specific rank condition [Rolland et al., 2022]. In this work, we show that the conditions developed under full access to the expert's policy cannot guarantee transferability in the more practical scenario where we have access only to demonstrations of the expert. Instead of a binary rank condition, we propose principal angles as a more refined measure of similarity and dissimilarity between transition laws. Based on this, we then establish two key results: 1) a sufficient condition for transferability to any transition laws when learning from at least two experts with sufficiently different transition laws, and 2) a sufficient condition for transferability to local changes in the transition law when learning from a single expert. Furthermore, we also provide a probably approximately correct (PAC) algorithm and an end-to-end analysis for learning transferable rewards from demonstrations of multiple experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hojoon Lee, Hyeonseo Cho, Hyunseung Kim, Donghu Kim, Dugki Min, Jaegul Choo, Clare Lyle</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the loss of generalization ability in neural networks, revisiting warm-starting experiments from Ash & Adams. Our empirical analysis reveals that common methods designed to enhance plasticity by maintaining trainability provide limited benefits to generalization. While reinitializing the network can be effective, it also risks losing valuable prior knowledge. To this end, we introduce the Hare & Tortoise, inspired by the brain's complementary learning system. Hare & Tortoise consists of two components: the Hare network, which rapidly adapts to new information analogously to the hippocampus, and the Tortoise network, which gradually integrates knowledge akin to the neocortex. By periodically reinitializing the Hare network to the Tortoise's weights, our method preserves plasticity while retaining general knowledge. Hare & Tortoise can effectively maintain the network's ability to generalize, which improves advanced reinforcement learning algorithms on the Atari-100k benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Ran, Jinyuan Liu, Yichen Gong, Jingyi Zheng, Xinlei He, Tianshuo Cong, Anyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreak attacks induce Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful responses, posing severe misuse threats. Though research on jailbreak attacks and defenses is emerging, there is no consensus on evaluating jailbreaks, i.e., the methods to assess the harmfulness of an LLM's response are varied. Each approach has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, impacting their alignment with human values, as well as the time and financial cost. This diversity challenges researchers in choosing suitable evaluation methods and comparing different attacks and defenses. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of jailbreak evaluation methodologies, drawing from nearly 90 jailbreak research published between May 2023 and April 2024. Our study introduces a systematic taxonomy of jailbreak evaluators, offering indepth insights into their strengths and weaknesses, along with the current status of their adaptation. To aid further research, we propose JailbreakEval, a toolkit for evaluating jailbreak attempts. JailbreakEval includes various evaluators out-of-the-box, enabling users to obtain results with a single command or customized evaluation workflows. In summary, we regard JailbreakEval to be a catalyst that simplifies the evaluation process in jailbreak research and fosters an inclusive standard for jailbreak evaluation within the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: \textbf{Objective:} Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide, encompassing a prodromal stage known as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), where patients may either progress to AD or remain stable. The objective of the work was to capture structural and functional modulations of brain structure and function relying on multimodal MRI data and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, also in case of missing views, with the twofold goal of classifying AD patients versus healthy controls and detecting MCI converters. % in two distinct tasks, dealing with also missing data.\\ \textbf{Approach:} We propose a multimodal DL-based classification framework where a generative module employing Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks was introduced in the latent space for imputing missing data (a common issue of multimodal approaches). Explainable AI method was then used to extract input features' relevance allowing for post-hoc validation and enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations. \textbf{Main results:} Experimental results on two tasks, AD detection and MCI conversion, showed that our framework reached competitive performance in the state-of-the-art with an accuracy of $0.926\pm0.02$ and $0.711\pm0.01$ in the two tasks, respectively. The interpretability analysis revealed gray matter modulations in cortical and subcortical brain areas typically associated with AD. Moreover, impairments in sensory-motor and visual resting state networks along the disease continuum, as well as genetic mutations defining biological processes linked to endocytosis, amyloid-beta, and cholesterol, were identified. \textbf{Significance:} Our integrative and interpretable DL approach shows promising performance for AD detection and MCI prediction while shedding light on important biological insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linglong Qian, Tao Wang, Jun Wang, Hugh Logan Ellis, Robin Mitra, Richard Dobson, Zina Ibrahim</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how architectural and framework biases combine to influence model performance. Our investigation reveals varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies within EHRs, and that model effectiveness depends on how its combined biases align with medical time-series characteristics. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments show imputation performance variations of up to 20\% based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamesh Korangi, Christophe Mues, Cristi\'an Bravo</p>
<p>Abstract: Apart from assessing individual asset performance, investors in financial markets also need to consider how a set of firms performs collectively as a portfolio. Whereas traditional Markowitz-based mean-variance portfolios are widespread, network-based optimisation techniques offer a more flexible tool to capture complex interdependencies between asset values. However, most of the existing studies do not contain firms at risk of default and remove any firms that drop off indices over a certain time. This is the first study to also incorporate such firms in portfolio optimisation on a large scale. We propose and empirically test a novel method that leverages Graph Attention networks (GATs), a subclass of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, as deep learning-based models, can exploit network data to uncover nonlinear relationships. Their ability to handle high-dimensional data and accommodate customised layers for specific purposes makes them appealing for large-scale problems such as mid- and small-cap portfolio optimisation. This study utilises 30 years of data on mid-cap firms, creating graphs of firms using distance correlation and the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph approach. These graphs are the inputs to a GAT model incorporating weight and allocation constraints and a loss function derived from the Sharpe ratio, thus focusing on maximising portfolio risk-adjusted returns. This new model is benchmarked against a network characteristic-based portfolio, a mean variance-based portfolio, and an equal-weighted portfolio. The results show that the portfolio produced by the GAT-based model outperforms all benchmarks and is consistently superior to other strategies over a long period, while also being informative of market dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nitay Calderon, Roi Reichart</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in NLP systems, particularly with the introduction of LLMs, have led to widespread adoption of these systems by a broad spectrum of users across various domains, impacting decision-making, the job market, society, and scientific research. This surge in usage has led to an explosion in NLP model interpretability and analysis research, accompanied by numerous technical surveys. Yet, these surveys often overlook the needs and perspectives of explanation stakeholders. In this paper, we address three fundamental questions: Why do we need interpretability, what are we interpreting, and how? By exploring these questions, we examine existing interpretability paradigms, their properties, and their relevance to different stakeholders. We further explore the practical implications of these paradigms by analyzing trends from the past decade across multiple research fields. To this end, we retrieved thousands of papers and employed an LLM to characterize them. Our analysis reveals significant disparities between NLP developers and non-developer users, as well as between research fields, underscoring the diverse needs of stakeholders. For example, explanations of internal model components are rarely used outside the NLP field. We hope this paper informs the future design, development, and application of methods that align with the objectives and requirements of various stakeholders.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embodied AI represents systems where AI is integrated into physical entities. Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Pinckney, Christopher Batten, Mingjie Liu, Haoxing Ren, Brucek Khailany</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of large-language models (LLMs) to digital hardware code generation is an emerging field, with most LLMs primarily trained on natural language and software code. Hardware code like Verilog constitutes a small portion of training data, and few hardware benchmarks exist. The open-source VerilogEval benchmark, released in November 2023, provided a consistent evaluation framework for LLMs on code completion tasks. Since then, both commercial and open models have seen significant development.
  In this work, we evaluate new commercial and open models since VerilogEval's original release-including GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama3.1 (8B/70B/405B), Llama3 70B, Mistral Large, DeepSeek Coder (33B and 6.7B), CodeGemma 7B, and RTL-Coder-against an improved VerilogEval benchmark suite. We find measurable improvements in state-of-the-art models: GPT-4o achieves a 63% pass rate on specification-to-RTL tasks. The recently released and open Llama3.1 405B achieves a 58% pass rate, almost matching GPT-4o, while the smaller domain-specific RTL-Coder 6.7B models achieve an impressive 34% pass rate.
  Additionally, we enhance VerilogEval's infrastructure by automatically classifying failures, introducing in-context learning support, and extending the tasks to specification-to-RTL translation. We find that prompt engineering remains crucial for achieving good pass rates and varies widely with model and task. A benchmark infrastructure that allows for prompt engineering and failure analysis is essential for continued model development and deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangya Wan, Yuqi Wu, Jie Chen, Sheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Consistency mitigates hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by sampling multiple reasoning paths,but it lacks a systematic approach to determine the optimal number of samples or select the most faithful rationale. To address this limitation, we introduce Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency (RASC), a novel framework that enhances sampling efficiency and reasoning faithfulness by dynamically evaluating both outputs and rationales. RASC assesses the quality of reasoning and the consistency of answers for each generated sample, using these assessments to guide early stopping decisions and rationale selection. The framework employs criteria-based stopping and weighted majority voting, enabling more informed choices on when to halt sampling and which rationale to select. Our comprehensive experiments across diverse question-answering datasets demonstrate that RASC outperforms existing methods, reducing sample usage by approximately 70% while maintaining accuracy. Moreover, RASC facilitates the selection of high-fidelity rationales, thereby improving the faithfulness of LLM outputs. Our approach effectively addresses the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in LLM reasoning tasks, offering a new perspective for more nuanced, faithful, and effective utilization of LLMs in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mouxiang Chen, Lefei Shen, Zhuo Li, Xiaoyun Joy Wang, Jianling Sun, Chenghao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve better zero-shot forecast performance than existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting that visual models may offer a "free lunch" for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Pengcheng Xu, Junjie Hu, Zeyu Tang, Guang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning holds great potential for enabling large-scale healthcare research and collaboration across multiple centres while ensuring data privacy and security are not compromised. Although numerous recent studies suggest or utilize federated learning based methods in healthcare, it remains unclear which ones have potential clinical utility. This review paper considers and analyzes the most recent studies up to May 2024 that describe federated learning based methods in healthcare. After a thorough review, we find that the vast majority are not appropriate for clinical use due to their methodological flaws and/or underlying biases which include but are not limited to privacy concerns, generalization issues, and communication costs. As a result, the effectiveness of federated learning in healthcare is significantly compromised. To overcome these challenges, we provide recommendations and promising opportunities that might be implemented to resolve these problems and improve the quality of model development in federated learning with healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modeling the natural contour of fundamental frequency (F0) plays a critical role in music audio synthesis. However, transcribing and managing multiple F0 contours in polyphonic music is challenging, and explicit F0 contour modeling has not yet been explored for polyphonic instrumental synthesis. In this paper, we present ViolinDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based synthesis framework. For a given violin MIDI file, the first stage estimates the F0 contour as pitch bend information, and the second stage generates mel spectrogram incorporating these expressive details. The quantitative metrics and listening test results show that the proposed model generates more realistic violin sounds than the model without explicit pitch bend modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blessed Guda, Gabrial Zencha Ashungafac, Lawrence Francis, Carlee Joe-Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have brought about substantial advancements in the field of Question Answering (QA) systems. These models do remarkably well in addressing intricate inquiries in a variety of disciplines. However, because of domain-specific vocabulary, complex technological concepts, and the requirement for exact responses applying LLMs to specialized sectors like telecommunications presents additional obstacles. GPT-3.5 has been used in recent work, to obtain noteworthy accuracy for telecom-related questions in a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Notwithstanding these developments, the practical use of models such as GPT-3.5 is restricted by their proprietary nature and high computing demands. This paper introduces QMOS, an innovative approach which uses a Question-Masked loss and Option Shuffling trick to enhance the performance of LLMs in answering Multiple-Choice Questions in the telecommunications domain. Our focus was on using opensource, smaller language models (Phi-2 and Falcon-7B) within an enhanced RAG framework. Our multi-faceted approach involves several enhancements to the whole LLM-RAG pipeline of finetuning, retrieval, prompt engineering and inference. Our approaches significantly outperform existing results, achieving accuracy improvements from baselines of 24.70% to 49.30% with Falcon-7B and from 42.07% to 84.65% with Phi-2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Ghaffari, Mahsa Varshosaz, Einar Broch Johnsen, Andrzej W\k{a}sowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular reinforcement learning methods cannot operate directly on continuous state spaces. One solution for this problem is to partition the state space. A good partitioning enables generalization during learning and more efficient exploitation of prior experiences. Consequently, the learning process becomes faster and produces more reliable policies. However, partitioning introduces approximation, which is particularly harmful in the presence of nonlinear relations between state components. An ideal partition should be as coarse as possible, while capturing the key structure of the state space for the given problem. This work extracts partitions from the environment dynamics by symbolic execution. We show that symbolic partitioning improves state space coverage with respect to environmental behavior and allows reinforcement learning to perform better for sparse rewards. We evaluate symbolic state space partitioning with respect to precision, scalability, learning agent performance and state space coverage for the learnt policies.</p>

As an application, we prove, for the first time, that the classical tabular average reward temporal difference learning converges to a sample path dependent fixed point.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the meaning of infant cries is a significant challenge for young parents in caring for their newborns. The presence of background noise and the lack of labeled data present practical challenges in developing systems that can detect crying and analyze its underlying reasons. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven framework, "InfantCryNet," for accomplishing these tasks. To address the issue of data scarcity, we employ pre-trained audio models to incorporate prior knowledge into our model. We propose the use of statistical pooling and multi-head attention pooling techniques to extract features more effectively. Additionally, knowledge distillation and model quantization are applied to enhance model efficiency and reduce the model size, better supporting industrial deployment in mobile devices. Experiments on real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 4.4% in classification accuracy. The model compression effectively reduces the model size by 7% without compromising performance and by up to 28% with only an 8% decrease in accuracy, offering practical insights for model selection and system design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Ohayon, Tomer Michaeli, Michael Elad</p>
<p>Abstract: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Bornstein, Zora Che, Suhas Julapalli, Abdirisak Mohamed, Amrit Singh Bedi, Furong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era of "moving fast and breaking things", regulators have moved slowly to pick up the safety, bias, and legal debris left in the wake of broken Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment. While there is much-warranted discussion about how to address the safety, bias, and legal woes of state-of-the-art AI models, rigorous and realistic mathematical frameworks to regulate AI are lacking. Our paper addresses this challenge, proposing an auction-based regulatory mechanism that provably incentivizes devices (i) to deploy compliant models and (ii) to participate in the regulation process. We formulate AI regulation as an all-pay auction where enterprises submit models for approval. The regulator enforces compliance thresholds and further rewards models exhibiting higher compliance than their peers. We derive Nash Equilibria demonstrating that rational agents will submit models exceeding the prescribed compliance threshold. Empirical results show that our regulatory auction boosts compliance rates by 20% and participation rates by 15% compared to baseline regulatory mechanisms, outperforming simpler frameworks that merely impose minimum compliance standards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fillipe dos Santos Silva, Gabriel Kenzo Kakimoto, Julio Cesar dos Reis, Marcelo S. Reis</p>
<p>Abstract: Cluster analysis plays a crucial role in various domains and applications, such as customer segmentation in marketing. These contexts often involve multimodal data, including both tabular and textual datasets, making it challenging to represent hidden patterns for obtaining meaningful clusters. This study introduces ERASMO, a framework designed to fine-tune a pretrained language model on textually encoded tabular data and generate embeddings from the fine-tuned model. ERASMO employs a textual converter to transform tabular data into a textual format, enabling the language model to process and understand the data more effectively. Additionally, ERASMO produces contextually rich and structurally representative embeddings through techniques such as random feature sequence shuffling and number verbalization. Extensive experimental evaluations were conducted using multiple datasets and baseline approaches. Our results demonstrate that ERASMO fully leverages the specific context of each tabular dataset, leading to more precise and nuanced embeddings for accurate clustering.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Zhao, Sanghyun Woo, Ziyu Wan, Yandong Li, Han Zhang, Boqing Gong, Hartwig Adam, Xuhui Jia, Ting Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In generative modeling, tokenization simplifies complex data into compact, structured representations, creating a more efficient, learnable space. For high-dimensional visual data, it reduces redundancy and emphasizes key features for high-quality generation. Current visual tokenization methods rely on a traditional autoencoder framework, where the encoder compresses data into latent representations, and the decoder reconstructs the original input. In this work, we offer a new perspective by proposing denoising as decoding, shifting from single-step reconstruction to iterative refinement. Specifically, we replace the decoder with a diffusion process that iteratively refines noise to recover the original image, guided by the latents provided by the encoder. We evaluate our approach by assessing both reconstruction (rFID) and generation quality (FID), comparing it to state-of-the-art autoencoding approaches. By adopting iterative reconstruction through diffusion, our autoencoder, namely $\epsilon$-VAE, achieves high reconstruction quality, which in turn enhances downstream generation quality by 22% and provides 2.3$\times$ inference speedup. We hope this work offers new insights into integrating iterative generation and autoencoding for improved compression and generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingxu Wang, Mengzhu Wang, Siwei Liu, Nan Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Graph Networks (SGNs) have garnered significant attraction from researchers and industry due to their ability to address energy consumption challenges in graph classification. However, SGNs are only effective for in-distribution data and cannot tackle out-of-distribution data. In this paper, we first propose the domain adaptation problem in SGNs, and introduce a novel framework named Degree-aware Spiking Graph Domain Adaptation for Classification (DeSGDA). The proposed DeSGDA addresses the spiking graph domain adaptation problem in three aspects: node degree-aware personalized spiking representation, adversarial feature distribution alignment, and pseudo-label distillation. First, we introduce the personalized spiking representation method for generating degree-dependent spiking signals. Specifically, the node degree determines the threshold of triggering a spike, allowing this personalized approach to capture more expressive information for classification. Then, we propose the graph feature distribution alignment module that is adversarially trained using membrane potential against a domain discriminator. Such an alignment module can efficiently maintain high performance and low energy consumption in the case of inconsistent distribution. Additionally, we extract consistent predictions across two spaces to create reliable pseudo-labels, effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the DeSGDA compared with competitive baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Mozaffari, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Maryam Mehri Dehnavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional model compression techniques for LLMs address high memory consumption and slow inference challenges but typically require computationally expensive retraining to preserve accuracy. In contrast, one-shot compression methods eliminate retraining cost, but struggle to achieve accuracy comparable to dense models. This paper presents SLIM, a new one-shot compression framework that holistically integrates hardware-friendly quantization, sparsity, and low-rank approximation into a unified process. First, we formulate the quantization process using a probabilistic approach (SLIM-Quant) that enables us to apply uniform quantization. Then, we use an existing one-shot pruning method to apply semi-structured sparsity on top of the quantized weights. Finally, to compensate for the introduced aggregated quantization and sparsity error, we use a novel saliency function with unique invertible and additive features that enables us to mathematically compute the value of low-rank adapters. SLIM improves model accuracy by up to 5.66% (LLaMA-2-7B) for 2:4 sparsity with 4-bit weight quantization, outperforming prior methods. Models compressed with SLIM achieve up to 3.78x and 3.75x layer-wise speedup on Nvidia RTX3060 and A100 GPUs, respectively. We also propose an optional PEFT recipe that further improves accuracy by up to 1.66% (LLaMA-2-13B) compared to SLIM without fine-tuning</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengfei Cheng, Yangdi Huang, Yunxuan Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Tidal energy is one of the key components in increasing the penetration rate of renewable energy. The penetration of tidal energy in the electrical grid depends on the accuracy of tidal current speed forecasting. Modeling inaccuracies hinder forecast accuracy. Previous research has primarily used physical models to forecast tidal current speed. However, tidal current variations influenced by the orbital periods of celestial bodies make accurate physical modeling challenging. Researching the multi-periodicity of tides is crucial for accurately forecasting tidal current speed. In this article, we propose the Wavelet-Enhanced Convolutional Network (WCN) to learn multi-periodicity. The framework embeds intra-period and inter-period variations of one-dimensional tidal current data into the rows and columns of a two-dimensional tensor. Then, the two-dimensional variations of the sequence can be processed by convolutional kernels. We integrate a time-frequency analysis method into the framework to further address local periodic features. Additionally, to enhance the framework's stability, we optimize the framework's hyperparameters with the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator algorithm. The proposed framework avoids the lack of learning multi-periodicity. Compared with benchmarks, the proposed framework reduces the mean absolute error and mean square error in 10-step forecasting by, at most, 90.36% and 97.56%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Reber, Sean Richardson, Todd Nief, Cristina Garbacea, Victor Veitch</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models are widely used as proxies for human preferences when aligning or evaluating LLMs. However, reward models are black boxes, and it is often unclear what, exactly, they are actually rewarding. In this paper we develop Rewrite-based Attribute Treatment Estimator (RATE) as an effective method for measuring the sensitivity of a reward model to high-level attributes of responses, such as sentiment, helpfulness, or complexity. Importantly, RATE measures the causal effect of an attribute on the reward. RATE uses LLMs to rewrite responses to produce imperfect counterfactual examples that can be used to measure causal effects. A key challenge is that these rewrites are imperfect in a manner that can induce substantial bias in the estimated sensitivity of the reward model to the attribute. The core idea of RATE is to adjust for this imperfect-rewrite effect by rewriting twice. We establish the validity of the RATE procedure and show empirically that it is an effective estimator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeed Rahmani, Zhenlin Xu, Simeon C. Calvert, Bart van Arem</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of automated vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems presents an unprecedented opportunity to enhance road safety and efficiency. However, understanding the interactions between AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) at intersections remains an open research question. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining behavioral differences and adaptations of AVs and HVs at unsignalized intersections by utilizing two large-scale AV datasets from Waymo and Lyft. By using a systematic methodology, the research identifies and analyzes merging and crossing conflicts by calculating key safety and efficiency metrics, including time to collision (TTC), post-encroachment time (PET), maximum required deceleration (MRD), time advantage (TA), and speed and acceleration profiles. The findings reveal a paradox in mixed traffic flow: while AVs maintain larger safety margins, their conservative behavior can lead to unexpected situations for human drivers, potentially causing unsafe conditions. From a performance point of view, human drivers exhibit more consistent behavior when interacting with AVs versus other HVs, suggesting AVs may contribute to harmonizing traffic flow patterns. Moreover, notable differences were observed between Waymo and Lyft vehicles, which highlights the importance of considering manufacturer-specific AV behaviors in traffic modeling and management strategies for the safe integration of AVs. The processed dataset utilized in this study is openly published to foster the research on AV-HV interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Chen, Bike Xie, Jundong Li, Cong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of language tasks, but their deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to the substantial memory requirements imposed by their large parameter sizes. Weight-only quantization presents a promising solution to reduce the memory footprint of LLMs. However, existing approaches primarily focus on integer-bit quantization, limiting their adaptability to fractional-bit quantization tasks and preventing the full utilization of available storage space on devices. In this paper, we introduce Channel-Wise Mixed-Precision Quantization (CMPQ), a novel mixed-precision quantization method that allocates quantization precision in a channel-wise pattern based on activation distributions. By assigning different precision levels to different weight channels, CMPQ can adapt to any bit-width constraint. CMPQ employs a non-uniform quantization strategy and incorporates two outlier extraction techniques that collaboratively preserve the critical information, thereby minimizing the quantization loss. Experiments on different sizes of LLMs demonstrate that CMPQ not only enhances performance in integer-bit quantization tasks but also achieves significant performance gains with a modest increase in memory usage. CMPQ thus represents an adaptive and effective approach to LLM quantization, offering substantial benefits across diverse device capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Zhang, Fengzhuo Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Wei Gao, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling language models to handle longer contexts introduces substantial memory challenges due to the growing cost of key-value (KV) caches. Motivated by the efficiency gains of hybrid models and the broad availability of pretrained large transformer backbones, we explore transitioning transformer models into hybrid architectures for a more efficient generation. In this work, we propose LightTransfer, a lightweight method that transforms models such as LLaMA into hybrid variants. Our approach identifies lazy layers -- those focusing on recent or initial tokens -- and replaces their full attention with streaming attention. This transformation can be performed without any training for long-context understanding tasks or with minimal fine-tuning for o1-like long reasoning generation tasks that require stronger reasoning capabilities. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and models (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, QwQ-STILL) demonstrate that, even when half of the layers are identified as lazy, LightTransfer achieves up to 2.17$\times$ throughput improvement with minimal performance loss ($<1.5\%$ on LongBench) and achieves 53.3\% on math benchmark AIME24 of advanced o1-like long reasoning model QwQ-STILL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Wang, Wanwan Wang, Yimin Huang, Zhaopeng Peng, Ziqi Yang, Ming Yao, Cheng Wang, Xiaoliang Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been commonly utilized for social recommendation systems. However, real-world scenarios often present challenges related to user privacy and business constraints, inhibiting direct access to valuable social information from other platforms. While many existing methods have tackled matrix factorization-based social recommendations without direct social data access, developing GNN-based federated social recommendation models under similar conditions remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, we propose a novel vertical federated social recommendation method leveraging privacy-preserving two-party graph convolution networks (P4GCN) to enhance recommendation accuracy without requiring direct access to sensitive social information. First, we introduce a Sandwich-Encryption module to ensure comprehensive data privacy during the collaborative computing process. Second, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the privacy guarantees, considering the participation of both curious and honest parties. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that P4GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SeongYeub Chu, JongWoo Kim, Bryan Wong, MunYong Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing automated essay scoring (AES) has solely relied on essay text without using explanatory rationales for the scores, thereby forgoing an opportunity to capture the specific aspects evaluated by rubric indicators in a fine-grained manner. This paper introduces Rationale-based Multiple Trait Scoring (RMTS), a novel approach for multi-trait essay scoring that integrates prompt-engineering-based large language models (LLMs) with a fine-tuning-based essay scoring model using a smaller large language model (S-LLM). RMTS uses an LLM-based trait-wise rationale generation system where a separate LLM agent generates trait-specific rationales based on rubric guidelines, which the scoring model uses to accurately predict multi-trait scores. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including ASAP, ASAP++, and Feedback Prize, show that RMTS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and vanilla S-LLMs in trait-specific scoring. By assisting quantitative assessment with fine-grained qualitative rationales, RMTS enhances the trait-wise reliability, providing partial explanations about essays.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Yang, Jiaqi Zheng, Guihai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring verifiable and interpretable safety of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is crucial for its deployment in real-world applications. Existing approaches like verification-in-the-loop training, however, face challenges such as difficulty in deployment, inefficient training, lack of interpretability, and suboptimal performance in property satisfaction and reward performance. In this work, we propose a novel verification-driven interpretation-in-the-loop framework Reintrainer to develop trustworthy DRL models, which are guaranteed to meet the expected constraint properties. Specifically, in each iteration, this framework measures the gap between the on-training model and predefined properties using formal verification, interprets the contribution of each input feature to the model's output, and then generates the training strategy derived from the on-the-fly measure results, until all predefined properties are proven. Additionally, the low reusability of existing verifiers and interpreters motivates us to develop Reinfier, a general and fundamental tool within Reintrainer for DRL verification and interpretation. Reinfier features breakpoints searching and verification-driven interpretation, associated with a concise constraint-encoding language DRLP. Evaluations demonstrate that Reintrainer outperforms the state-of-the-art on six public benchmarks in both performance and property guarantees.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lawrence Jang, Yinheng Li, Charles Ding, Justin Lin, Paul Pu Liang, Dan Zhao, Rogerio Bonatti, Kazuhito Koishida</p>
<p>Abstract: Videos are often used to learn or extract the necessary information to complete tasks in ways different than what text and static imagery alone can provide. However, many existing agent benchmarks neglect long-context video understanding, instead focusing on text or static image inputs. To bridge this gap, we introduce VideoWebArena (VideoWA), a benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of long-context multimodal agents for video understanding. VideoWA consists of 2,021 web agent tasks based on manually crafted video tutorials, which total almost four hours of content. For our benchmark, we define a taxonomy of long-context video-based agent tasks with two main areas of focus: skill retention and factual retention. While skill retention tasks evaluate whether an agent can use a given human demonstration to complete a task efficiently, the factual retention task evaluates whether an agent can retrieve instruction-relevant information from a video to complete a task. We find that the best model achieves 13.3% success on factual retention tasks and 45.8% on factual retention QA pairs, far below human performance at 73.9% and 79.3%, respectively. On skill retention tasks, long-context models perform worse with tutorials than without, exhibiting a 5% performance decrease in WebArena tasks and a 10.3% decrease in VisualWebArena tasks. Our work highlights the need to improve the agentic abilities of long-context multimodal models and provides a testbed for future development with long-context video agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modeling stochastic and irregularly sampled time series is a challenging problem found in a wide range of applications, especially in medicine. Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in solving simple scientific problems but, even with domain-specific fine-tuning, often produce hallucinations for complex ones. While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this reliability issue, models finetuned on tool usage only often over-rely on them, incurring unnecessary costs from resource-intensive scientific tools even for simpler problems. Inspired by how human experts assess the complexity of the problem before choosing the solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tools-generated solutions. In the second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we classify questions as easy or hard based on the WKL-trained model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for simple problems while switching to tools for challenging ones. We validate our method on 6 scientific benchmark datasets in climate science, epidemiology, and mathematics. Compared to the base 8B model, our trained models achieve 28.27% higher answer accuracy and 13.76% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 on 4 custom-created datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning has unlocked numerous opportunities for materials science, particularly in accelerating the design and analysis of materials. However, a significant challenge lies in the scarcity and high cost of obtaining high-quality materials datasets. While foundation models pre-trained on large datasets have excelled in fields like natural language processing by leveraging latent features through transfer learning, their application in materials science remains limited. Here, we present a foundation model specifically designed for composite materials. Pre-trained on a dataset of short-fiber composites to learn robust latent features, the model accurately predicts homogenized stiffness during transfer learning, even with limited training data. Additionally, our model effectively predicts the material's nonlinear behavior by transferring these learned features to an Interaction-based Material Network, which is a constitutive surrogate model. These results demonstrate the potential of our foundation model to capture complex material behaviors. Our findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of foundation models in composite materials. We anticipate extending this approach to more complex three-dimensional composite materials, polycrystalline materials, and beyond. Moreover, this framework enables high-accuracy predictions even when experimental data are scarce, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective materials design and analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Hu, Xiao Wang, Zezhen Ding, Lirong Wu, Huatian Zhang, Stan Z. Li, Sheng Wang, Jiheng Zhang, Ziyun Li, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based models have significant achievements in time series generation but suffer from inefficient computation: solving high-dimensional ODEs/SDEs via iterative numerical solvers demands hundreds to thousands of drift function evaluations per sample, incurring prohibitive costs. To resolve this, we propose FlowTS, an ODE-based model that leverages rectified flow with straight-line transport in probability space. By learning geodesic paths between distributions, FlowTS achieves computational efficiency through exact linear trajectory simulation, accelerating training and generation while improving performances. We further introduce an adaptive sampling strategy inspired by the exploration-exploitation trade-off, balancing noise adaptation and precision. Notably, FlowTS enables seamless adaptation from unconditional to conditional generation without retraining, ensuring efficient real-world deployment. Also, to enhance generation authenticity, FlowTS integrates trend and seasonality decomposition, attention registers (for global context aggregation), and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (for position information). For unconditional setting, extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, with context FID scores of 0.019 and 0.011 on Stock and ETTh datasets (prev. best: 0.067, 0.061). For conditional setting, we have achieved superior performance in solar forecasting (MSE 213, prev. best: 375) and MuJoCo imputation tasks (MSE 7e-5, prev. best 2.7e-4).

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of AI has led to more complex deep learning models, often operating as opaque "black boxes" with limited transparency in their decision-making. This lack of interpretability poses challenges, especially in high-stakes applications where understanding model output is crucial. This work highlights the importance of interpretability in fostering trust, accountability, and responsible deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce DLBacktrace, a novel, model-agnostic technique designed to provide clear insights into deep learning model decisions across a wide range of domains and architectures, including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformer-based LLM models. We present a comprehensive overview of DLBacktrace and benchmark its performance against established interpretability methods such as SHAP, LIME, and GradCAM. Our results demonstrate that DLBacktrace effectively enhances understanding of model behavior across diverse tasks. DLBacktrace is compatible with models developed in both PyTorch and TensorFlow, supporting architectures such as BERT, ResNet, U-Net, and custom DNNs for tabular data.

<p>Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is a widely used optimization technique across various fields. Existing $\textit{end-to-end learning}$ methods for MILP generate values for a subset of decision variables and delegate the remaining problem to traditional MILP solvers. However, this approach often fails to guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) due to inaccurate predictions and primarily focuses on binary decision variables. Satisfying all constraints is a prerequisite for obtaining the optimal solution, and the feasibility issue becomes even more critical with non-binary integer (integer, for short) variables. Thus, addressing the feasibility of MILP involving integer variables is crucial. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that not only finds the first feasible solution but also incrementally discovers better feasible solutions without delegating the remainder to off-the-shelf solvers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves (near-)optimal solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaron Veksler, Sharon Hornstein, Han Wang, Maria Laura Delle Monache, Daniel Urieli</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of connected automated vehicles represents an unprecedented opportunity for improving driving efficiency and alleviating traffic congestion. However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired time-headways are then used by adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems to adjust their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii) leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different locations, we propose a potentially practical, safe, and scalable system that can positively impact numerous road users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Khalifa, Yi-Chern Tan, Arash Ahmadian, Tom Hosking, Honglak Lee, Lu Wang, Ahmet \"Ust\"un, Tom Sherborne, Matthias Gall\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging has shown great promise at combining expert models, but the benefit of merging is unclear when merging "generalist" models trained on many tasks. We explore merging in the context of large (~100B) models, by recycling checkpoints that exhibit tradeoffs among different tasks. Such checkpoints are often created in the process of developing a frontier model, and the suboptimal ones are usually discarded. Given a pool of model checkpoints obtained from different training runs (e.g., different stages, objectives, hyperparameters, and data mixtures), which naturally show tradeoffs across different language capabilities (e.g., instruction following vs. code generation), we investigate whether merging can recycle such suboptimal models into a Pareto-optimal one. Our optimization algorithm tunes the weight of each checkpoint in a linear combination, resulting in such an optimal model that outperforms both individual models and merge-based baselines. Further analysis shows that good merges tend to include almost all checkpoints with non-zero weights, indicating that even seemingly bad initial checkpoints can contribute to good final merges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Adkins, Michael Bowling, Adam White</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of modern reinforcement learning algorithms critically relies on tuning ever-increasing numbers of hyperparameters. Often, small changes in a hyperparameter can lead to drastic changes in performance, and different environments require very different hyperparameter settings to achieve state-of-the-art performance reported in the literature. We currently lack a scalable and widely accepted approach to characterizing these complex interactions. This work proposes a new empirical methodology for studying, comparing, and quantifying the sensitivity of an algorithm's performance to hyperparameter tuning for a given set of environments. We then demonstrate the utility of this methodology by assessing the hyperparameter sensitivity of several commonly used normalization variants of PPO. The results suggest that several algorithmic performance improvements may, in fact, be a result of an increased reliance on hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenni Bi, Kai Han, Chuanjian Liu, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various language tasks, but solving complex reasoning problems remains a significant challenge. While existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT employs sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction, along with consensus-guided decision-making strategies to optimize both correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09961">What constitutes a Deep Fake? The blurry line between legitimate processing and manipulation under the EU AI Act</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristof Meding, Christoph Sorge</p>
<p>Abstract: When does a digital image resemble reality? The relevance of this question increases as the generation of synthetic images -- so called deep fakes -- becomes increasingly popular. Deep fakes have gained much attention for a number of reasons -- among others, due to their potential to disrupt the political climate. In order to mitigate these threats, the EU AI Act implements specific transparency regulations for generating synthetic content or manipulating existing content. However, the distinction between real and synthetic images is -- even from a computer vision perspective -- far from trivial. We argue that the current definition of deep fakes in the AI act and the corresponding obligations are not sufficiently specified to tackle the challenges posed by deep fakes. By analyzing the life cycle of a digital photo from the camera sensor to the digital editing features, we find that: (1.) Deep fakes are ill-defined in the EU AI Act. The definition leaves too much scope for what a deep fake is. (2.) It is unclear how editing functions like Google's ``best take'' feature can be considered as an exception to transparency obligations. (3.) The exception for substantially edited images raises questions about what constitutes substantial editing of content and whether or not this editing must be perceptible by a natural person. Our results demonstrate that complying with the current AI Act transparency obligations is difficult for providers and deployers. As a consequence of the unclear provisions, there is a risk that exceptions may be either too broad or too limited. We intend our analysis to foster the discussion on what constitutes a deep fake and to raise awareness about the pitfalls in the current AI Act transparency obligations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonchu Park, Byungjun Kim, Bugeun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) generate more human-like texts, concerns about the side effects of AI-generated texts (AIGT) have grown. So, researchers have developed methods for detecting AIGT. However, two challenges remain. First, the performance of detecting black-box LLMs is low because existing models focus on probabilistic features. Second, most AIGT detectors have been tested on a single-candidate setting, which assumes that we know the origin of an AIGT and which may deviate from the real-world scenario. To resolve these challenges, we propose DART, which consists of four steps: rephrasing, semantic parsing, scoring, and multiclass classification. We conducted three experiments to test the performance of DART. The experimental result shows that DART can discriminate multiple black-box LLMs without probabilistic features and the origin of AIGT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingjia Shi, Yuhao Zhou, Ruiji Yu, Zekai Li, Zhiyuan Liang, Xuanlei Zhao, Xiaojiang Peng, Shanmukha Ramakrishna Vedantam, Wangbo Zhao, Kai Wang, Yang You</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Mamba (e.g., Vim) has successfully been integrated into computer vision, and token reduction has yielded promising outcomes in Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, token reduction performs less effectively on Vision Mamba compared to ViTs. Pruning informative tokens in Mamba leads to a high loss of key knowledge and bad performance. This makes it not a good solution for enhancing efficiency in Mamba. Token merging, which preserves more token information than pruning, has demonstrated commendable performance in ViTs. Nevertheless, vanilla merging performance decreases as the reduction ratio increases either, failing to maintain the key knowledge in Mamba. Re-training the token-reduced model enhances the performance of Mamba, by effectively rebuilding the key knowledge. Empirically, pruned Vims only drop up to 0.9% accuracy on ImageNet-1K, recovered by our proposed framework R-MeeTo in our main evaluation. We show how simple and effective the fast recovery can be achieved at minute-level, in particular, a 35.9% accuracy spike over 3 epochs of training on Vim-Ti. Moreover, Vim-Ti/S/B are re-trained within 5/7/17 minutes, and Vim-S only drop 1.3% with 1.2x (up to 1.5x) speed up in inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in various intelligent tasks but still struggle with complex action reasoning tasks that require systematic search. To address this limitation, we propose a method that bridges the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs with the symbolic reasoning strengths of action languages. Our approach, termed "LLM+AL," leverages the LLM's strengths in semantic parsing and commonsense knowledge generation alongside the action language's proficiency in automated reasoning based on encoded knowledge. We compare LLM+AL against state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Ultra 1.0, and o1-preview, using benchmarks for complex reasoning about actions. Our findings indicate that, although all methods exhibit errors, LLM+AL, with relatively minimal human corrections, consistently leads to correct answers, whereas standalone LLMs fail to improve even with human feedback. LLM+AL also contributes to automated generation of action languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenglai Li, Jun Wang, Chang Tang, Xinzhong Zhu, Wei Zhang, Xinwang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MvC) aims to integrate information from different views to enhance the capability of the model in capturing the underlying data structures. The widely used joint training paradigm in MvC is potentially not fully leverage the multi-view information, since the imbalanced and under-optimized view-specific features caused by the uniform learning objective for all views. For instance, particular views with more discriminative information could dominate the learning process in the joint training paradigm, leading to other views being under-optimized. To alleviate this issue, we first analyze the imbalanced phenomenon in the joint-training paradigm of multi-view clustering from the perspective of gradient descent for each view-specific feature extractor. Then, we propose a novel balanced multi-view clustering (BMvC) method, which introduces a view-specific contrastive regularization (VCR) to modulate the optimization of each view. Concretely, VCR preserves the sample similarities captured from the joint features and view-specific ones into the clustering distributions corresponding to view-specific features to enhance the learning process of view-specific feature extractors. Additionally, a theoretical analysis is provided to illustrate that VCR adaptively modulates the magnitudes of gradients for updating the parameters of view-specific feature extractors to achieve a balanced multi-view learning procedure. In such a manner, BMvC achieves a better trade-off between the exploitation of view-specific patterns and the exploration of view-invariance patterns to fully learn the multi-view information for the clustering task. Finally, a set of experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art approaches on eight benchmark MvC datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanbo Hua, Federico Berto, Jiwoo Son, Seunghyun Kang, Changhyun Kwon, Jinkyoo Park</p>
<p>Abstract: The profiled vehicle routing problem (PVRP) is a generalization of the heterogeneous capacitated vehicle routing problem (HCVRP) in which the objective is to optimize the routes of vehicles to serve client demands subject to different vehicle profiles, with each having a preference or constraint on a per-client basis. While existing learning methods have shown promise for solving the HCVRP in real-time, no learning method exists to solve the more practical and challenging PVRP. In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Attention Model with Profiles (CAMP), a novel approach that learns efficient solvers for PVRP using multi-agent reinforcement learning. CAMP employs a specialized attention-based encoder architecture to embed profiled client embeddings in parallel for each vehicle profile. We design a communication layer between agents for collaborative decision-making across profiled embeddings at each decoding step and a batched pointer mechanism to attend to the profiled embeddings to evaluate the likelihood of the next actions. We evaluate CAMP on two variants of PVRPs: PVRP with preferences, which explicitly influence the reward function, and PVRP with zone constraints with different numbers of agents and clients, demonstrating that our learned solvers achieve competitive results compared to both classical state-of-the-art neural multi-agent models in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance in collaborative recommendation through their ability to conduct high-order representation smoothing, effectively capturing structural information within users' interaction patterns. However, existing GNN paradigms face significant challenges in scalability and robustness when handling large-scale, noisy, and real-world datasets. To address these challenges, we present LightGNN, a lightweight and distillation-based GNN pruning framework designed to substantially reduce model complexity while preserving essential collaboration modeling capabilities. Our LightGNN framework introduces a computationally efficient pruning module that adaptively identifies and removes redundant edges and embedding entries for model compression. The framework is guided by a resource-friendly hierarchical knowledge distillation objective, whose intermediate layer augments the observed graph to maintain performance, particularly in high-rate compression scenarios. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate LightGNN's effectiveness, significantly improving both computational efficiency and recommendation accuracy. Notably, LightGNN achieves an 80% reduction in edge count and 90% reduction in embedding entries while maintaining performance comparable to more complex state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of our LightGNN framework is available at the github repository: https://github.com/HKUDS/LightGNN.</p>

<p>Abstract: An image encoder pre-trained by self-supervised learning can be used as a general-purpose feature extractor to build downstream classifiers for various downstream tasks. However, many studies showed that an attacker can embed a trojan into an encoder such that multiple downstream classifiers built based on the trojaned encoder simultaneously inherit the trojan behavior. In this work, we propose TrojanDec, the first data-free method to identify and recover a test input embedded with a trigger. Given a (trojaned or clean) encoder and a test input, TrojanDec first predicts whether the test input is trojaned. If not, the test input is processed in a normal way to maintain the utility. Otherwise, the test input will be further restored to remove the trigger. Our extensive evaluation shows that TrojanDec can effectively identify the trojan (if any) from a given test input and recover it under state-of-the-art trojan attacks. We further demonstrate by experiments that our TrojanDec outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaling up Large Language Model(LLM) training involves fitting a tremendous amount of training parameters across a limited number of workers. However, methods like ZeRO-3 that drastically reduce GPU memory pressure often incur heavy communication to ensure global synchronization and consistency. Established efforts such as ZeRO++ use secondary partitions to avoid inter-node communications, given that intra-node GPU-GPU transfer generally has more bandwidth and lower latency than inter-node connections. However, as more capable infrastructure like Frontier, equipped with AMD GPUs, emerged with impressive computing capability, there is a need for investigations on the hardware topology and to develop targeted strategies to improve training efficiency. In this work, we propose a collection of communication and optimization strategies for ZeRO++ to reduce communication costs and improve memory utilization. In this paper, we propose a 3-level hierarchical partitioning specifically for the current 2nd ranked supercomputing cluster, Frontier, which aims at leveraging various bandwidths across layers of communications (GCD-GCD, GPU-GPU, and inter-node) to reduce communication overhead. For a 20B GPT model, we observe a 1.71x increase in TFLOPS per GPU when compared with ZeRO++ up to 384 GCDs and a scaling efficiency of 0.94 for up to 384 GCDs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olabode T. Ajenifujah, Amir Barati Farimani</p>
<p>Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) is a rapidly evolving technology that has attracted applications across a wide range of fields due to its ability to fabricate complex geometries. However, one of the key challenges in AM is achieving consistent print quality. This inconsistency is often attributed to uncontrolled melt pool dynamics, partly caused by spatter which can lead to defects. Therefore, capturing and controlling the evolution of the melt pool is crucial for enhancing process stability and part quality. In this study, we developed a framework to support decision-making towards efficient AM process operations, capable of facilitating quality control and minimizing defects via machine learning (ML) and polynomial symbolic regression models. We implemented experimentally validated computational tools, specifically for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processes as a cost-effective approach to collect large datasets. For a dataset consisting of 281 varying process conditions, parameters such as melt pool dimensions (length, width, depth), melt pool geometry (area, volume), and volume indicated as spatter were extracted. Using machine learning (ML) and polynomial symbolic regression models, a high R2 of over 95 % was achieved in predicting the melt pool dimensions and geometry features on both the training and testing datasets, with either process conditions (power and velocity) or melt pool dimensions as the model inputs. In the case of volume indicated as spatter the value of the R2 improved after logarithmic transforming the model inputs, which were either the process conditions or the melt pool dimensions. Among the investigated ML models, the ExtraTree model achieved the highest R2 values of 96.7 % and 87.5 %.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often requires costly human annotations. To address this, LLM-based judges have been proposed, which compare the outputs of two LLMs enabling the ranking of models without human intervention. While several approaches have been proposed, many confounding factors are present between different papers. For instance the model, the prompt and other hyperparameters are typically changed at the same time making apple-to-apple comparisons challenging. In this paper, we propose to systematically analyze and tune hyperparameter of LLM judges. To alleviate the high cost of evaluating a judge, we propose to leverage multi-objective multi-fidelity which allows to find judges that trades accuracy for cost and also reduce significantly the cost of the search. Our method identifies judges that not only outperform existing benchmarks in accuracy and cost-efficiency but also utilize open-weight models, ensuring greater accessibility and reproducibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to provide step-by-step rationales, improving performance on complex tasks. Despite its benefits, vanilla CoT often fails to fully verify intermediate inferences and can produce misleading explanations. In this work, we propose Layered Chain-of-Thought (Layered-CoT) Prompting, a novel framework that systematically segments the reasoning process into multiple layers, each subjected to external checks and optional user feedback. We expand on the key concepts, present three scenarios -- medical triage, financial risk assessment, and agile engineering -- and demonstrate how Layered-CoT surpasses vanilla CoT in terms of transparency, correctness, and user engagement. By integrating references from recent arXiv papers on interactive explainability, multi-agent frameworks, and agent-based collaboration, we illustrate how Layered-CoT paves the way for more reliable and grounded explanations in high-stakes domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cory Hymel, Hiroe Johnson</p>
<p>Abstract: The majority of research around Large Language Models (LLM) application to software development has been on the subject of code generation. There is little literature on LLMs' impact on requirements engineering (RE), which deals with the process of developing and verifying the system requirements. Within RE, there is a subdiscipline of requirements elicitation, which is the practice of discovering and documenting requirements for a system from users, customers, and other stakeholders. In this analysis, we compare LLM's ability to elicit requirements of a software system, as compared to that of a human expert in a time-boxed and prompt-boxed study. We found LLM-generated requirements were evaluated as more aligned (+1.12) than human-generated requirements with a trend of being more complete (+10.2%). Conversely, we found users tended to believe that solutions they perceived as more aligned had been generated by human experts. Furthermore, while LLM-generated documents scored higher and performed at 720x the speed, their cost was, on average, only 0.06% that of a human expert. Overall, these findings indicate that LLMs will play an increasingly important role in requirements engineering by improving requirements definitions, enabling more efficient resource allocation, and reducing overall project timelines.</p>

Key contributions of this work include: (1) a novel use of LLMs to generate and refine financial metrics with implicit domain-specific knowledge, (2) a scoring mechanism to ensure that evolved metrics generalize effectively to unseen data, and (3) an empirical demonstration of 3x predictive power for future risk-returns, and 2x portfolio performance. Experimental results in a real-world dataset highlight the superiority of discovered metrics, making them highly relevant to portfolio managers and financial decision-makers. This framework not only addresses the limitations of existing metrics but also showcases the potential of LLMs in advancing financial analytics, paving the way for informed and robust investment strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kefan Dong, Tengyu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental challenge in formal theorem proving by LLMs is the lack of high-quality training data. Although reinforcement learning or expert iteration partially mitigates this issue by alternating between LLM generating proofs and finetuning them on correctly generated ones, performance quickly plateaus due to the scarcity of correct proofs (sparse rewards). To keep improving the models with limited data, we draw inspiration from mathematicians, who continuously develop new results, partly by proposing novel conjectures or exercises (which are often variants of known results) and attempting to solve them. We design the Self-play Theorem Prover (STP) that simultaneously takes on two roles, conjecturer and prover, each providing training signals to the other. The conjecturer is trained iteratively on previously generated conjectures that are barely provable by the current prover, which incentivizes it to generate increasingly challenging conjectures over time. The prover attempts to prove the conjectures with standard expert iteration. We evaluate STP with both Lean and Isabelle formal versifiers. With 19.8 billion tokens generated during the training in Lean, STP proves 26.3% of the statements in the LeanWorkbook dataset, doubling the previous best result of 13.2% achieved through expert iteration. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance among whole-proof generation methods on miniF2F-test (61.1%, pass@3200), Proofnet-test (23.1%, pass@3200) and PutnamBench (8/644, pass@64).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianwei Chen, Zifan Zhang, Yuchen Liu, Xianfeng Terry Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in handling unpredictable edge-case scenarios, such as adversarial pedestrian movements, dangerous vehicle maneuvers, and sudden environmental changes. Current end-to-end driving models struggle with generalization to these rare events due to limitations in traditional detection and prediction approaches. To address this, we propose INSIGHT (Integration of Semantic and Visual Inputs for Generalized Hazard Tracking), a hierarchical vision-language model (VLM) framework designed to enhance hazard detection and edge-case evaluation. By using multimodal data fusion, our approach integrates semantic and visual representations, enabling precise interpretation of driving scenarios and accurate forecasting of potential dangers. Through supervised fine-tuning of VLMs, we optimize spatial hazard localization using attention-based mechanisms and coordinate regression techniques. Experimental results on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate a substantial improvement in hazard prediction straightforwardness and accuracy over existing models, achieving a notable increase in generalization performance. This advancement enhances the robustness and safety of autonomous driving systems, ensuring improved situational awareness and potential decision-making in complex real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunju Kang, Geonhee Han, Yoonjae Jeong, Hogun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-audio generation models (TAG) have achieved significant advances in generating audio conditioned on text descriptions. However, a critical challenge lies in the lack of transparency regarding how each textual input impacts the generated audio. To address this issue, we introduce AudioGenX, an Explainable AI (XAI) method that provides explanations for text-to-audio generation models by highlighting the importance of input tokens. AudioGenX optimizes an Explainer by leveraging factual and counterfactual objective functions to provide faithful explanations at the audio token level. This method offers a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the relationship between text inputs and audio outputs, enhancing both the explainability and trustworthiness of TAG models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AudioGenX in producing faithful explanations, benchmarked against existing methods using novel evaluation metrics specifically designed for audio generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyuan Zheng, Sudong Cai, Chuan Xiao, Yang Cao, Jianbin Qin, Masatoshi Yoshikawa, Makoto Onizuka</p>
<p>Abstract: In collaborative machine learning, data valuation, i.e., evaluating the contribution of each client' data to the machine learning model, has become a critical task for incentivizing and selecting positive data contributions. However, existing studies often assume that clients engage in data valuation truthfully, overlooking the practical motivation for clients to exaggerate their contributions. To unlock this threat, this paper introduces the first data overvaluation attack, enabling strategic clients to have their data significantly overvalued. Furthermore, we propose a truthful data valuation metric, named Truth-Shapley. Truth-Shapley is the unique metric that guarantees some promising axioms for data valuation while ensuring that clients' optimal strategy is to perform truthful data valuation. Our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of existing data valuation metrics to the data overvaluation attack and validate the robustness and effectiveness of Truth-Shapley.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Cao, Zhao Song, Chiwun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper considers an efficient video modeling process called Video Latent Flow Matching (VLFM). Unlike prior works, which randomly sampled latent patches for video generation, our method relies on current strong pre-trained image generation models, modeling a certain caption-guided flow of latent patches that can be decoded to time-dependent video frames. We first speculate multiple images of a video are differentiable with respect to time in some latent space. Based on this conjecture, we introduce the HiPPO framework to approximate the optimal projection for polynomials to generate the probability path. Our approach gains the theoretical benefits of the bounded universal approximation error and timescale robustness. Moreover, VLFM processes the interpolation and extrapolation abilities for video generation with arbitrary frame rates. We conduct experiments on several text-to-video datasets to showcase the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewoo Kang, Kjerstin Thorson, Tai-Quan Peng, Dan Hiaeshutter-Rice, Sanguk Lee, Stuart Soroka</p>
<p>Abstract: This study attempts to advancing content analysis methodology from consensus-oriented to coordination-oriented practices, thereby embracing diverse coding outputs and exploring the dynamics among differential perspectives. As an exploratory investigation of this approach, we evaluate six GPT-4o configurations to analyze sentiment in Fox News and MSNBC transcripts on Biden and Trump during the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign, examining patterns across these models. By assessing each model's alignment with ideological perspectives, we explore how partisan selective processing could be identified in LLM-Assisted Content Analysis (LACA). Findings reveal that partisan persona LLMs exhibit stronger ideological biases when processing politically congruent content. Additionally, intercoder reliability is higher among same-partisan personas compared to cross-partisan pairs. This approach enhances the nuanced understanding of LLM outputs and advances the integrity of AI-driven social science research, enabling simulations of real-world implications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Zhou, Giannis Karamanolakis, Victor Soto, Anna Rumshisky, Mayank Kulkarni, Furong Huang, Wei Ai, Jianhua Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) in domains such as mathematical reasoning and coding has led to growing interest in methods for merging these expert LLMs into a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, with the goal of enhancing performance in each domain while retaining effectiveness on general tasks. However, the effective merging of expert models remains an open challenge, especially for models with highly divergent weight parameters or different architectures. State-of-the-art MoE merging methods only work with homogeneous model architectures and rely on simple unweighted averaging to merge expert layers, which does not address parameter interference and requires extensive fine-tuning of the merged MoE to restore performance. To address these limitations, this paper introduces new MoE merging techniques, including strategies to mitigate parameter interference, routing heuristics to reduce the need for MoE fine-tuning, and a novel method for merging experts with different architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, reducing fine-tuning costs, improving performance over state-of-the-art methods, and expanding the applicability of MoE merging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Ohayon, Hila Manor, Tomer Michaeli, Michael Elad</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01403">AdaSVD: Adaptive Singular Value Decomposition for Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiteng Li, Mingyuan Xia, Jingyuan Zhang, Zheng Hui, Linghe Kong, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their substantial memory requirements present significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has emerged as a promising compression technique for LLMs, offering considerable reductions in memory overhead. However, existing SVD-based methods often struggle to effectively mitigate the errors introduced by SVD truncation, leading to a noticeable performance gap when compared to the original models. Furthermore, applying a uniform compression ratio across all transformer layers fails to account for the varying importance of different layers. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSVD, an adaptive SVD-based LLM compression approach. Specifically, AdaSVD introduces adaComp, which adaptively compensates for SVD truncation errors by alternately updating the singular matrices U and V^T. Additionally, AdaSVD introduces adaCR, which adaptively assigns layer-specific compression ratios based on the relative importance of each layer. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics demonstrate that AdaSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SVD-based methods, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced memory requirements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peizhe Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Defect detection in fabrics is critical for quality control, yet existing methods often struggle with complex backgrounds and shape-specific defects. In this paper, we propose an improved fabric defect detection model based on YOLOv11. To enhance the detection of strip defects, we introduce a Strip Perception Module (SPM) that improves feature capture through multi-scale convolution. We further enhance the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) by integrating a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, resulting in the SE-SPPF module, which better integrates spatial and channel information for more effective defect feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a novel focal enhanced complete intersection over union (FECIoU) metric with adaptive weights, addressing scale differences and class imbalance by adjusting the weights of hard-to-detect instances through focal loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a 0.8-8.1% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) on the Tianchi dataset and a 1.6-13.2% improvement on our custom dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin A. Spiegel, Lucas Gelfond, George Konidaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract symbolic writing systems are semiotic codes that are ubiquitous in modern society but are otherwise absent in the animal kingdom. Anthropological evidence suggests that the earliest forms of some writing systems originally consisted of iconic pictographs, which signify their referent via visual resemblance. While previous studies have examined the emergence and, separately, the evolution of pictographic writing systems through a computational lens, most employ non-naturalistic methodologies that make it difficult to draw clear analogies to human and animal cognition. We develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning testbed for emergent communication called a Signification Game, and formulate a model of inferential communication that enables agents to leverage visual theory of mind to communicate actions using pictographs. Our model, which is situated within a broader formalism for animal communication, sheds light on the cognitive and cultural processes that led to the development of early writing systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Chen, Marco Cusumano-Towner, Brody Huval, Aleksei Petrenko, Jackson Hamburger, Vladlen Koltun, Philipp Kr\"ahenb\"uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive digital agents (IDAs) leverage APIs of stateful digital environments to perform tasks in response to user requests. While IDAs powered by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) can react to feedback from interface invocations in multi-step exchanges, they have not been trained in their respective digital environments. Prior methods accomplish less than half of tasks in sophisticated benchmarks such as AppWorld. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains IDAs directly in their target environments. We formalize this training as a partially observable Markov decision process and derive LOOP, a data- and memory-efficient variant of proximal policy optimization. LOOP uses no value network and maintains exactly one copy of the underlying LLM in memory, making its implementation straightforward and as memory-efficient as fine-tuning a single LLM. A 32-billion-parameter agent trained with LOOP in the AppWorld environment outperforms the much larger OpenAI o1 agent by 9 percentage points (15% relative). To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of RL to IDAs that interact with a stateful, multi-domain, multi-app environment via direct API calls. Our analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of RL in this area, showing that the agent learns to consult the API documentation, avoid unwarranted assumptions, minimize confabulation, and recover from setbacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isha Puri, Shivchander Sudalairaj, Guangxuan Xu, Kai Xu, Akash Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.
