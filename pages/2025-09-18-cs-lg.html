<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Evan Chrisnanto, Yulison Herry Chrisnanto, Ferry Faizal</p>
<p>Abstract: Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13516">An Analysis of Optimizer Choice on Energy Efficiency and Performance in Neural Network Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Almog</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly complex and computationally demanding, understanding the environmental impact of training decisions becomes critical for sustainable AI development. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study investigating the relationship between optimizer choice and energy efficiency in neural network training. We conducted 360 controlled experiments across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) using eight popular optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adadelta, Adamax, NAdam) with 15 random seeds each. Using CodeCarbon for precise energy tracking on Apple M1 Pro hardware, we measured training duration, peak memory usage, carbon dioxide emissions, and final model performance. Our findings reveal substantial trade-offs between training speed, accuracy, and environmental impact that vary across datasets and model complexity. We identify AdamW and NAdam as consistently efficient choices, while SGD demonstrates superior performance on complex datasets despite higher emissions. These results provide actionable insights for practitioners seeking to balance performance and sustainability in machine learning workflows.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13520">Learning Nonlinear Responses in PET Bottle Buckling with a Hybrid DeepONet-Transolver Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Varun Kumar, Jing Bi, Cyril Ngo Ngoc, Victor Oancea, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural surrogates and operator networks for solving partial differential equation (PDE) problems have attracted significant research interest in recent years. However, most existing approaches are limited in their ability to generalize solutions across varying non-parametric geometric domains. In this work, we address this challenge in the context of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottle buckling analysis, a representative packaging design problem conventionally solved using computationally expensive finite element analysis (FEA). We introduce a hybrid DeepONet-Transolver framework that simultaneously predicts nodal displacement fields and the time evolution of reaction forces during top load compression. Our methodology is evaluated on two families of bottle geometries parameterized by two and four design variables. Training data is generated using nonlinear FEA simulations in Abaqus for 254 unique designs per family. The proposed framework achieves mean relative $L^{2}$ errors of 2.5-13% for displacement fields and approximately 2.4% for time-dependent reaction forces for the four-parameter bottle family. Point-wise error analyses further show absolute displacement errors on the order of $10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}$, with the largest discrepancies confined to localized geometric regions. Importantly, the model accurately captures key physical phenomena, such as buckling behavior, across diverse bottle geometries. These results highlight the potential of our framework as a scalable and computationally efficient surrogate, particularly for multi-task predictions in computational mechanics and applications requiring rapid design evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative machine learning offers new opportunities to better understand complex Earth system dynamics. Recent diffusion-based methods address spectral biases and improve ensemble calibration in weather forecasting compared to deterministic methods, yet have so far proven difficult to scale stably at high resolutions. We introduce AERIS, a 1.3 to 80B parameter pixel-level Swin diffusion transformer to address this gap, and SWiPe, a generalizable technique that composes window parallelism with sequence and pipeline parallelism to shard window-based transformers without added communication cost or increased global batch size. On Aurora (10,080 nodes), AERIS sustains 10.21 ExaFLOPS (mixed precision) and a peak performance of 11.21 ExaFLOPS with $1 \times 1$ patch size on the 0.25{\deg} ERA5 dataset, achieving 95.5% weak scaling efficiency, and 81.6% strong scaling efficiency. AERIS outperforms the IFS ENS and remains stable on seasonal scales to 90 days, highlighting the potential of billion-parameter diffusion models for weather and climate prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulia Pimonova, Michael G. Taylor, Alice Allen, Ping Yang, Nicholas Lubbers</p>
<p>Abstract: Chemists in search of structure-property relationships face great challenges due to limited high quality, concordant datasets. Machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced predictive capabilities in chemical sciences, but these modern data-driven approaches have increased the demand for data. In response to the growing demand for explainable AI (XAI) and to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and human comprehensibility, we introduce LAMeL - a Linear Algorithm for Meta-Learning that preserves interpretability while improving the prediction accuracy across multiple properties. While most approaches treat each chemical prediction task in isolation, LAMeL leverages a meta-learning framework to identify shared model parameters across related tasks, even if those tasks do not share data, allowing it to learn a common functional manifold that serves as a more informed starting point for new unseen tasks. Our method delivers performance improvements ranging from 1.1- to 25-fold over standard ridge regression, depending on the domain of the dataset. While the degree of performance enhancement varies across tasks, LAMeL consistently outperforms or matches traditional linear methods, making it a reliable tool for chemical property prediction where both accuracy and interpretability are critical.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13608">Is GPT-4o mini Blinded by its Own Safety Filters? Exposing the Multimodal-to-Unimodal Bottleneck in Hate Speech Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Niruthiha Selvanayagam, Ted Kurti</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become integral to daily digital life, understanding their safety architectures is a critical problem for AI Alignment. This paper presents a systematic analysis of OpenAI's GPT-4o mini, a globally deployed model, on the difficult task of multimodal hate speech detection. Using the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset, we conduct a multi-phase investigation on 500 samples to probe the model's reasoning and failure modes. Our central finding is the experimental identification of a "Unimodal Bottleneck," an architectural flaw where the model's advanced multimodal reasoning is systematically preempted by context-blind safety filters. A quantitative validation of 144 content policy refusals reveals that these overrides are triggered in equal measure by unimodal visual 50% and textual 50% content. We further demonstrate that this safety system is brittle, blocking not only high-risk imagery but also benign, common meme formats, leading to predictable false positives. These findings expose a fundamental tension between capability and safety in state-of-the-art LMMs, highlighting the need for more integrated, context-aware alignment strategies to ensure AI systems can be deployed both safely and effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bishnu Bhusal, Manoj Acharya, Ramneet Kaur, Colin Samplawski, Anirban Roy, Adam D. Cobb, Rohit Chadha, Susmit Jha</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed natural language understanding and generation, but they raise privacy concerns due to potential exposure of sensitive information. Studies have highlighted the risk of information leakage, where adversaries can extract sensitive information embedded in the prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel private prediction framework for generating high-quality synthetic text with strong privacy guarantees. Our approach leverages the Differential Privacy (DP) framework to ensure worst-case theoretical bounds on information leakage without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying models.The proposed method performs inference on private records and aggregates the resulting per-token output distributions. This enables the generation of longer and coherent synthetic text while maintaining privacy guarantees. Additionally, we propose a simple blending operation that combines private and public inference to further enhance utility. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on in-context-learning (ICL) tasks, making it a promising direction for privacy-preserving text generation while maintaining high utility.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13633">DeepLogit: A sequentially constrained explainable deep learning modeling approach for transport policy analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Oon, Rakhi Manohar Mepparambath, Ling Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant progress of deep learning models in multitude of applications, their adaption in planning and policy related areas remains challenging due to the black-box nature of these models. In this work, we develop a set of DeepLogit models that follow a novel sequentially constrained approach in estimating deep learning models for transport policy analysis. In the first step of the proposed approach, we estimate a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with only linear terms, which is equivalent of a linear-in-parameter multinomial logit model. We then estimate other deep learning models by constraining the parameters that need interpretability at the values obtained in the linear-in-parameter CNN model and including higher order terms or by introducing advanced deep learning architectures like Transformers. Our approach can retain the interpretability of the selected parameters, yet provides significantly improved model accuracy than the discrete choice model. We demonstrate our approach on a transit route choice example using real-world transit smart card data from Singapore. This study shows the potential for a unifying approach, where theory-based discrete choice model (DCM) and data-driven AI models can leverage each other's strengths in interpretability and predictive power. With the availability of larger datasets and more complex constructions, such approach can lead to more accurate models using discrete choice models while maintaining its applicability in planning and policy-related areas.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13634">Secure UAV-assisted Federated Learning: A Digital Twin-Driven Approach with Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Bokhtiar Al Zami, Md Raihan Uddin, Dinh C. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained popularity as a privacy-preserving method of training machine learning models on decentralized networks. However to ensure reliable operation of UAV-assisted FL systems, issues like as excessive energy consumption, communication inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities must be solved. This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates Digital Twin (DT) technology and Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning (zkFed) to tackle these challenges. UAVs act as mobile base stations, allowing scattered devices to train FL models locally and upload model updates for aggregation. By incorporating DT technology, our approach enables real-time system monitoring and predictive maintenance, improving UAV network efficiency. Additionally, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) strengthen security by allowing model verification without exposing sensitive data. To optimize energy efficiency and resource management, we introduce a dynamic allocation strategy that adjusts UAV flight paths, transmission power, and processing rates based on network conditions. Using block coordinate descent and convex optimization techniques, our method significantly reduces system energy consumption by up to 29.6% compared to conventional FL approaches. Simulation results demonstrate improved learning performance, security, and scalability, positioning this framework as a promising solution for next-generation UAV-based intelligent networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasin Hasanpoor, Bahram Tarvirdizadeh, Khalil Alipour, Mohammad Ghamari</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel method that transforms multimodal physiological signalsphotoplethysmography (PPG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and acceleration (ACC) into 2D image matrices to enhance stress detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Unlike traditional approaches that process these signals separately or rely on fixed encodings, our technique fuses them into structured image representations that enable CNNs to capture temporal and cross signal dependencies more effectively. This image based transformation not only improves interpretability but also serves as a robust form of data augmentation. To further enhance generalization and model robustness, we systematically reorganize the fused signals into multiple formats, combining them in a multi stage training pipeline. This approach significantly boosts classification performance. While demonstrated here in the context of stress detection, the proposed method is broadly applicable to any domain involving multimodal physiological signals, paving the way for more accurate, personalized, and real time health monitoring through wearable technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirun Guo, Feng Zhang, Kai Jia, Tao Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose LLM-Interleaved (LLM-I), a flexible and dynamic framework that reframes interleaved image-text generation as a tool-use problem. LLM-I is designed to overcome the "one-tool" bottleneck of current unified models, which are limited to synthetic imagery and struggle with tasks requiring factual grounding or programmatic precision. Our framework empowers a central LLM or MLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual tools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code execution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these tools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a hybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and MLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model backbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a large margin across four benchmarks. We also introduce a novel test-time scaling strategy that provides further performance gains. Project Page: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/LLM-I.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geon Lee, Bhuvesh Kumar, Clark Mingxuan Ju, Tong Zhao, Kijung Shin, Neil Shah, Liam Collins</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative recommendation plays a crucial role in personalized systems, predicting users' future interactions from their historical behavior sequences. A critical yet underexplored factor in training these models is data augmentation, the process of constructing training data from user interaction histories. By shaping the training distribution, data augmentation directly and often substantially affects model generalization and performance. Nevertheless, in much of the existing work, this process is simplified, applied inconsistently, or treated as a minor design choice, without a systematic and principled understanding of its effects.
  Motivated by our empirical finding that different augmentation strategies can yield large performance disparities, we conduct an in-depth analysis of how they reshape training distributions and influence alignment with future targets and generalization to unseen inputs. To systematize this design space, we propose GenPAS, a generalized and principled framework that models augmentation as a stochastic sampling process over input-target pairs with three bias-controlled steps: sequence sampling, target sampling, and input sampling. This formulation unifies widely used strategies as special cases and enables flexible control of the resulting training distribution. Our extensive experiments on benchmark and industrial datasets demonstrate that GenPAS yields superior accuracy, data efficiency, and parameter efficiency compared to existing strategies, providing practical guidance for principled training data construction in generative recommendation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongkang Du, Jieyu Zhao, Yijun Yang, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The fairness-accuracy trade-off is a key challenge in NLP tasks. Current work focuses on finding a single "optimal" solution to balance the two objectives, which is limited considering the diverse solutions on the Pareto front. This work intends to provide controllable trade-offs according to the user's preference of the two objectives, which is defined as a reference vector. To achieve this goal, we apply multi-objective optimization (MOO), which can find solutions from various regions of the Pareto front. However, it is challenging to precisely control the trade-off due to the stochasticity of the training process and the high dimentional gradient vectors. Thus, we propose Controllable Pareto Trade-off (CPT) that can effectively train models to perform different trade-offs according to users' preferences. CPT 1) stabilizes the fairness update with a moving average of stochastic gradients to determine the update direction, and 2) prunes the gradients by only keeping the gradients of the critical parameters. We evaluate CPT on hate speech detection and occupation classification tasks. Experiments show that CPT can achieve a higher-quality set of solutions on the Pareto front than the baseline methods. It also exhibits better controllability and can precisely follow the human-defined reference vectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingsheng Peng, Shutao Zhang, Xi Zheng, Ye Xue, Xinyu Qin, Tsung-Hui Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate localized wireless channel modeling is a cornerstone of cellular network optimization, enabling reliable prediction of network performance during parameter tuning. Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is the state-of-the-art channel modeling framework tailored for cellular network optimization. However, traditional LSCM methods, which infer the channel's Angular Power Spectrum (APS) from Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) measurements, suffer from critical limitations: they are typically confined to single-cell, single-grid and single-carrier frequency analysis and fail to capture complex cross-domain interactions. To overcome these challenges, we propose RF-LSCM, a novel framework that models the channel APS by jointly representing large-scale signal attenuation and multipath components within a radiance field. RF-LSCM introduces a multi-domain LSCM formulation with a physics-informed frequency-dependent Attenuation Model (FDAM) to facilitate the cross frequency generalization as well as a point-cloud-aided environment enhanced method to enable multi-cell and multi-grid channel modeling. Furthermore, to address the computational inefficiency of typical neural radiance fields, RF-LSCM leverages a low-rank tensor representation, complemented by a novel Hierarchical Tensor Angular Modeling (HiTAM) algorithm. This efficient design significantly reduces GPU memory requirements and training time while preserving fine-grained accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-cell datasets demonstrate that RF-LSCM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 30% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) for coverage prediction and a 22% MAE improvement by effectively fusing multi-frequency data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Yu, Cheuk Hin Ho, Yangshuai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving PDEs, yet existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches for PINNs generally lack rigorous statistical guarantees. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a distribution-free conformal prediction (CP) framework for UQ in PINNs. This framework calibrates prediction intervals by constructing nonconformity scores on a calibration set, thereby yielding distribution-free uncertainty estimates with rigorous finite-sample coverage guarantees for PINNs. To handle spatial heteroskedasticity, we further introduce local conformal quantile estimation, enabling spatially adaptive uncertainty bands while preserving theoretical guarantee. Through systematic evaluations on typical PDEs (damped harmonic oscillator, Poisson, Allen-Cahn, and Helmholtz equations) and comprehensive testing across multiple uncertainty metrics, our results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves reliable calibration and locally adaptive uncertainty intervals, consistently outperforming heuristic UQ approaches. By bridging PINNs with distribution-free UQ, this work introduces a general framework that not only enhances calibration and reliability, but also opens new avenues for uncertainty-aware modeling of complex PDE systems.</p>

A core feature is elevated momentary (state) anxiety in social situations, yet little prior work has measured or predicted fluctuations in this anxiety throughout the day. Capturing these intra-day dynamics is critical for designing real-time, personalized interventions such as Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs). To address this gap, we conducted a study with socially anxious college students (N=91; 72 after exclusions) using our custom smartwatch-based system over an average of 9.03 days (SD = 2.95). Participants received seven ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) per day to report state anxiety. We developed a base model on over 10,000 days of external heart rate data, transferred its representations to our dataset, and fine-tuned it to generate probabilistic predictions. These were combined with trait-level measures in a meta-learner. Our pipeline achieved 60.4% balanced accuracy in state anxiety detection in our dataset. To evaluate generalizability, we applied the training approach to a separate hold-out set from the TILES-18 dataset-the same dataset used for pretraining. On 10,095 once-daily EMAs, our method achieved 59.1% balanced accuracy, outperforming prior work by at least 7%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhi She, Xunkai Li, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models (SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However, existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end, we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with 1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces a critical dilemma: existing protection mechanisms like differential privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE) enforce a rigid trade-off, forcing a choice between model utility and computational efficiency. This lack of flexibility hinders the practical implementation. To address this, we introduce ParaAegis, a parallel protection framework designed to give practitioners flexible control over the privacy-utility-efficiency balance. Our core innovation is a strategic model partitioning scheme. By applying lightweight DP to the less critical, low norm portion of the model while protecting the remainder with HE, we create a tunable system. A distributed voting mechanism ensures consensus on this partitioning. Theoretical analysis confirms the adjustments between efficiency and utility with the same privacy. Crucially, the experimental results demonstrate that by adjusting the hyperparameters, our method enables flexible prioritization between model accuracy and training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyotaek Jeon, Hyunwook Lee, Juwon Kim, Sungahn Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic forecasting represents a crucial problem within intelligent transportation systems. In recent research, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising method, but their intrinsic design, tailored primarily for sequential token processing, introduces notable challenges in effectively capturing spatial dependencies. Specifically, the inherent limitations of LLMs in modeling spatial relationships and their architectural incompatibility with graph-structured spatial data remain largely unaddressed. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ST-LINK, a novel framework that enhances the capability of Large Language Models to capture spatio-temporal dependencies. Its key components are Spatially-Enhanced Attention (SE-Attention) and the Memory Retrieval Feed-Forward Network (MRFFN). SE-Attention extends rotary position embeddings to integrate spatial correlations as direct rotational transformations within the attention mechanism. This approach maximizes spatial learning while preserving the LLM's inherent sequential processing structure. Meanwhile, MRFFN dynamically retrieves and utilizes key historical patterns to capture complex temporal dependencies and improve the stability of long-term forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-LINK surpasses conventional deep learning and LLM approaches, and effectively captures both regular traffic patterns and abrupt changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongxin Shen, Yanyong Huang, Bin Wang, Jinyuan Chang, Shiyu Liu, Tianrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has recently received increasing attention for its promising ability in dimensionality reduction on multi-view unlabeled data. Existing MUFS methods typically select discriminative features by capturing correlations between features and clustering labels. However, an important yet underexplored question remains: \textit{Are such correlations sufficiently reliable to guide feature selection?} In this paper, we analyze MUFS from a causal perspective by introducing a novel structural causal model, which reveals that existing methods may select irrelevant features because they overlook spurious correlations caused by confounders. Building on this causal perspective, we propose a novel MUFS method called CAusal multi-view Unsupervised feature Selection leArning (CAUSA). Specifically, we first employ a generalized unsupervised spectral regression model that identifies informative features by capturing dependencies between features and consensus clustering labels. We then introduce a causal regularization module that can adaptively separate confounders from multi-view data and simultaneously learn view-shared sample weights to balance confounder distributions, thereby mitigating spurious correlations. Thereafter, integrating both into a unified learning framework enables CAUSA to select causally informative features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CAUSA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of causal multi-view feature selection in the unsupervised setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianshuo Zhang, Wenzhe Zhai, Rui Yann, Jia Gao, He Cao, Xianglei Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction is common in engineering and natural systems, where floating-body motion is governed by added mass, drag, and background flows. Modeling these dissipative dynamics is difficult: black-box neural models regress state derivatives with limited interpretability and unstable long-horizon predictions. We propose Floating-Body Hydrodynamic Neural Networks (FHNN), a physics-structured framework that predicts interpretable hydrodynamic parameters such as directional added masses, drag coefficients, and a streamfunction-based flow, and couples them with analytic equations of motion. This design constrains the hypothesis space, enhances interpretability, and stabilizes integration. On synthetic vortex datasets, FHNN achieves up to an order-of-magnitude lower error than Neural ODEs, recovers physically consistent flow fields. Compared with Hamiltonian and Lagrangian neural networks, FHNN more effectively handles dissipative dynamics while preserving interpretability, which bridges the gap between black-box learning and transparent system identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Wiesner, Matthias Wessling, Stephen Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing through a ``train once, deploy anywhere'' paradigm, where a single pre-trained model adapts to countless downstream tasks without retraining. Access to a Physics Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative -- democratizing access to high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized architectures by up to 29x, (2) zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) stable long-term predictions through 50-timestep rollouts. By establishing that a single model can learn generalizable physical principles from data alone, this work opens the path toward a universal PFM that could transform computational science and engineering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers a new paradigm for addressing complex financial problems intractable for classical methods. This work specifically tackles the challenge of few-shot credit risk assessment, a critical issue in inclusive finance where data scarcity and imbalance limit the effectiveness of conventional models. To address this, we design and implement a novel hybrid quantum-classical workflow. The methodology first employs an ensemble of classical machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for intelligent feature engineering and dimensionality reduction. Subsequently, a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), trained via the parameter-shift rule, serves as the core classifier. This framework was evaluated through numerical simulations and deployed on the Quafu Quantum Cloud Platform's ScQ-P21 superconducting processor. On a real-world credit dataset of 279 samples, our QNN achieved a robust average AUC of 0.852 +/- 0.027 in simulations and yielded an impressive AUC of 0.88 in the hardware experiment. This performance surpasses a suite of classical benchmarks, with a particularly strong result on the recall metric. This study provides a pragmatic blueprint for applying quantum computing to data-constrained financial scenarios in the NISQ era and offers valuable empirical evidence supporting its potential in high-stakes applications like inclusive finance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13841">An End-to-End Differentiable, Graph Neural Network-Embedded Pore Network Model for Permeability Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingqi Zhao, Heng Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of permeability in porous media is essential for modeling subsurface flow. While pure data-driven models offer computational efficiency, they often lack generalization across scales and do not incorporate explicit physical constraints. Pore network models (PNMs), on the other hand, are physics-based and efficient but rely on idealized geometric assumptions to estimate pore-scale hydraulic conductance, limiting their accuracy in complex structures. To overcome these limitations, we present an end-to-end differentiable hybrid framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a PNM. In this framework, the analytical formulas used for conductance calculations are replaced by GNN-based predictions derived from pore and throat features. The predicted conductances are then passed to the PNM solver for permeability computation. In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric assumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The GNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in the thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using a single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by backpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation) and the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled, end-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes well across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and traditional PNM approaches. Gradient-based sensitivity analysis further reveals physically consistent feature influences, enhancing model interpretability. This approach offers a scalable and physically informed framework for permeability prediction in complex porous media, reducing model uncertainty and improving accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sitong Chen, Shen Nie, Jiacheng Sun, Zijin Feng, Zhenguo Li, Ji-Rong Wen, Chongxuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a systematic theoretical framework that interprets masked diffusion models (MDMs) as solutions to energy minimization problems in discrete optimal transport. Specifically, we prove that three distinct energy formulations--kinetic, conditional kinetic, and geodesic energy--are mathematically equivalent under the structure of MDMs, and that MDMs minimize all three when the mask schedule satisfies a closed-form optimality condition. This unification not only clarifies the theoretical foundations of MDMs, but also motivates practical improvements in sampling. By parameterizing interpolation schedules via Beta distributions, we reduce the schedule design space to a tractable 2D search, enabling efficient post-training tuning without model modification. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our energy-inspired schedules outperform hand-crafted baselines, particularly in low-step sampling settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanting Zhou, Jinshan Lai, Fengchun Zhang, Zeqin Wu, Fengli Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-IID data and partial participation induce client drift and inconsistent local optima in federated learning, causing unstable convergence and accuracy loss. We present FedSSG, a stochastic sampling-guided, history-aware drift alignment method. FedSSG maintains a per-client drift memory that accumulates local model differences as a lightweight sketch of historical gradients; crucially, it gates both the memory update and the local alignment term by a smooth function of the observed/expected participation ratio (a phase-by-expectation signal derived from the server sampler). This statistically grounded gate stays weak and smooth when sampling noise dominates early, then strengthens once participation statistics stabilize, contracting the local-global gap without extra communication. Across CIFAR-10/100 with 100/500 clients and 2-15 percent participation, FedSSG consistently outperforms strong drift-aware baselines and accelerates convergence; on our benchmarks it improves test accuracy by up to a few points (e.g., about +0.9 on CIFAR-10 and about +2.7 on CIFAR-100 on average over the top-2 baseline) and yields about 4.5x faster target-accuracy convergence on average. The method adds only O(d) client memory and a constant-time gate, and degrades gracefully to a mild regularizer under near-IID or uniform sampling. FedSSG shows that sampling statistics can be turned into a principled, history-aware phase control to stabilize and speed up federated training.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13906">TFMAdapter: Lightweight Instance-Level Adaptation of Foundation Models for Forecasting with Covariates</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Afrin Dange, Sunita Sarawagi</p>
<p>Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in univariate forecasting on new time series simply by conditioned on a brief history of past values. Their success demonstrates that large-scale pretraining across diverse domains can acquire the inductive bias to generalize from temporal patterns in a brief history. However, most TSFMs are unable to leverage covariates -- future-available exogenous variables critical for accurate forecasting in many applications -- due to their domain-specific nature and the lack of associated inductive bias. We propose TFMAdapter, a lightweight, instance-level adapter that augments TSFMs with covariate information without fine-tuning. Instead of retraining, TFMAdapter operates on the limited history provided during a single model call, learning a non-parametric cascade that combines covariates with univariate TSFM forecasts. However, such learning would require univariate forecasts at all steps in the history, requiring too many calls to the TSFM. To enable training on the full historical context while limiting TSFM invocations, TFMAdapter uses a two-stage method: (1) generating pseudo-forecasts with a simple regression model, and (2) training a Gaussian Process regressor to refine predictions using both pseudo- and TSFM forecasts alongside covariates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TFMAdapter consistently outperforms both foundation models and supervised baselines, achieving a 24-27\% improvement over base foundation models with minimal data and computational overhead. Our results highlight the potential of lightweight adapters to bridge the gap between generic foundation models and domain-specific forecasting needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyobrata Mondal, Faizanuddin Ansari, Swagatam Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is critical, especially when biases compound across intersecting protected attributes like race, gender, and age. While existing methods address fairness for single attributes, they fail to capture the nuanced, multiplicative biases faced by intersectional subgroups. We introduce Adaptive Pareto Front Explorer (APFEx), the first framework to explicitly model intersectional fairness as a joint optimization problem over the Cartesian product of sensitive attributes. APFEx combines three key innovations- (1) an adaptive multi-objective optimizer that dynamically switches between Pareto cone projection, gradient weighting, and exploration strategies to navigate fairness-accuracy trade-offs, (2) differentiable intersectional fairness metrics enabling gradient-based optimization of non-smooth subgroup disparities, and (3) theoretical guarantees of convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate APFEx's superiority, reducing fairness violations while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work bridges a critical gap in fair ML, providing a scalable, model-agnostic solution for intersectional fairness.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work explores the application of ensemble modeling to the multidimensional regression problem of trajectory prediction for vehicles in urban environments. As newer and bigger state-of-the-art prediction models for autonomous driving continue to emerge, an important open challenge is the problem of how to combine the strengths of these big models without the need for costly re-training. We show how, perhaps surprisingly, combining state-of-the-art deep learning models out-of-the-box (without retraining or fine-tuning) with a simple confidence-weighted average method can enhance the overall prediction. Indeed, while combining trajectory prediction models is not straightforward, this simple approach enhances performance by 10% over the best prediction model, especially in the long-tailed metrics. We show that this performance improvement holds on both the NuScenes and Argoverse datasets, and that these improvements are made across the dataset distribution. The code for our work is open source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyue Li, Yingxin Liu, Hang Qi, Jieping Luo, Zhizhang Liu, Jingjin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the client selection problem in wireless Federated Learning (FL), with the objective of reducing the total required time to achieve a certain level of learning accuracy. Since the server cannot observe the clients' dynamic states that can change their computation and communication efficiency, we formulate client selection as a restless multi-armed bandit problem. We propose a scalable and efficient approach called the Whittle Index Learning in Federated Q-learning (WILF-Q), which uses Q-learning to adaptively learn and update an approximated Whittle index associated with each client, and then selects the clients with the highest indices. Compared to existing approaches, WILF-Q does not require explicit knowledge of client state transitions or data distributions, making it well-suited for deployment in practical FL settings. Experiment results demonstrate that WILF-Q significantly outperforms existing baseline policies in terms of learning efficiency, providing a robust and efficient approach to client selection in wireless FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Shahbazinia, Jonathan Dan, Jose A. Miranda, Giovanni Ansaloni, David Atienza</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: Epilepsy, a prevalent neurological disease, demands careful diagnosis and continuous care. Seizure detection remains challenging, as current clinical practice relies on expert analysis of electroencephalography, which is a time-consuming process and requires specialized knowledge. Addressing this challenge, this paper explores automated epileptic seizure detection using deep learning, focusing on personalized continual learning models that adapt to each patient's unique electroencephalography signal features, which evolve over time. Methods: In this context, our approach addresses the challenge of integrating new data into existing models without catastrophic forgetting, a common issue in static deep learning models. We propose EpiSMART, a continual learning framework for seizure detection that uses a size-constrained replay buffer and an informed sample selection strategy to incrementally adapt to patient-specific electroencephalography signals. By selectively retaining high-entropy and seizure-predicted samples, our method preserves critical past information while maintaining high performance with minimal memory and computational requirements. Results: Validation on the CHB-MIT dataset, shows that EpiSMART achieves a 21% improvement in the F1 score over a trained baseline without updates in all other patients. On average, EpiSMART requires only 6.46 minutes of labeled data and 6.28 updates per day, making it suitable for real-time deployment in wearable systems. Conclusion:EpiSMART enables robust and personalized seizure detection under realistic and resource-constrained conditions by effectively integrating new data into existing models without degrading past knowledge. Significance: This framework advances automated seizure detection by providing a continual learning approach that supports patient-specific adaptation and practical deployment in wearable healthcare systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivana Kesi\'c, Alja\v{z} Blatnik, Carolina Fortuna, Bla\v{z} Bertalani\v{c}</p>
<p>Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are increasingly disrupted by intentional jamming, degrading availability precisely when positioning and timing must remain operational. We address this by reframing jamming mitigation as dynamic graph regression and introducing a receiver-centric deep temporal graph network that predicts, and thus corrects, the receivers horizontal deviation in real time. At each 1 Hz epoch, the satellite receiver environment is represented as a heterogeneous star graph (receiver center, tracked satellites as leaves) with time varying attributes (e.g., SNR, azimuth, elevation, latitude/longitude). A single layer Heterogeneous Graph ConvLSTM (HeteroGCLSTM) aggregates one hop spatial context and temporal dynamics over a short history to output the 2D deviation vector applied for on the fly correction.
  We evaluate on datasets from two distinct receivers under three jammer profiles, continuous wave (cw), triple tone (cw3), and wideband FM, each exercised at six power levels between -45 and -70 dBm, with 50 repetitions per scenario (prejam/jam/recovery). Against strong multivariate time series baselines (MLP, uniform CNN, and Seq2Point CNN), our model consistently attains the lowest mean absolute error (MAE). At -45 dBm, it achieves 3.64 cm (GP01/cw), 7.74 cm (GP01/cw3), 4.41 cm (ublox/cw), 4.84 cm (ublox/cw3), and 4.82 cm (ublox/FM), improving to 1.65-2.08 cm by -60 to -70 dBm. On mixed mode datasets pooling all powers, MAE is 3.78 cm (GP01) and 4.25 cm (ublox10), outperforming Seq2Point, MLP, and CNN. A split study shows superior data efficiency: with only 10\% training data our approach remains well ahead of baselines (20 cm vs. 36-42 cm).</p>

<p>Abstract: In times of epidemics, swift reaction is necessary to mitigate epidemic spreading. For this reaction, localized approaches have several advantages, limiting necessary resources and reducing the impact of interventions on a larger scale. However, training a separate machine learning (ML) model on a local scale is often not feasible due to limited available data. Centralizing the data is also challenging because of its high sensitivity and privacy constraints. In this study, we consider a localized strategy based on the German counties and communities managed by the related local health authorities (LHA). For the preservation of privacy to not oppose the availability of detailed situational data, we propose a privacy-preserving forecasting method that can assist public health experts and decision makers. ML methods with federated learning (FL) train a shared model without centralizing raw data. Considering the counties, communities or LHAs as clients and finding a balance between utility and privacy, we study a FL framework with client-level differential privacy (DP). We train a shared multilayer perceptron on sliding windows of recent case counts to forecast the number of cases, while clients exchange only norm-clipped updates and the server aggregated updates with DP noise. We evaluate the approach on COVID-19 data on county-level during two phases. As expected, very strict privacy yields unstable, unusable forecasts. At a moderately strong level, the DP model closely approaches the non-DP model: $R^2= 0.94$ (vs. 0.95) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 26 % in November 2020; $R^2= 0.88$ (vs. 0.93) and MAPE of 21 % in March 2022. Overall, client-level DP-FL can deliver useful county-level predictions with strong privacy guarantees, and viable privacy budgets depend on epidemic phase, allowing privacy-compliant collaboration among health authorities for local forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Tovey, Julian Ho{\ss}bach, Sandro Kuppel, Tobias Ensslen, Jan C. Behrends, Christian Holm</p>
<p>Abstract: A device capable of performing real time classification of proteins in a clinical setting would allow for inexpensive and rapid disease diagnosis. One such candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by measuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a nanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the structure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be used to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time identification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the complexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the issue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram images via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time information in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When tested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of ~$81\,\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward practical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care. In addition, we demonstrate model transfer techniques that will be critical when deploying these models into real hardware, paving the way to a new method for real-time disease diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiara De Luca, Elisa Donati</p>
<p>Abstract: Queen bee presence is essential for the health and stability of honeybee colonies, yet current monitoring methods rely on manual inspections that are labor-intensive, disruptive, and impractical for large-scale beekeeping. While recent audio-based approaches have shown promise, they often require high power consumption, complex preprocessing, and are susceptible to ambient noise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight, multimodal system for queen detection based on environmental sensor fusion-specifically, temperature, humidity, and pressure differentials between the inside and outside of the hive. Our approach employs quantized decision tree inference on a commercial STM32 microcontroller, enabling real-time, low-power edge computing without compromising accuracy. We show that our system achieves over 99% queen detection accuracy using only environmental inputs, with audio features offering no significant performance gain. This work presents a scalable and sustainable solution for non-invasive hive monitoring, paving the way for autonomous, precision beekeeping using off-the-shelf, energy-efficient hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Wang, Enlu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the Bayesian risk-averse formulation in reinforcement learning (RL). To address the epistemic uncertainty due to a lack of data, we adopt the Bayesian Risk Markov Decision Process (BRMDP) to account for the parameter uncertainty of the unknown underlying model. We derive the asymptotic normality that characterizes the difference between the Bayesian risk value function and the original value function under the true unknown distribution. The results indicate that the Bayesian risk-averse approach tends to pessimistically underestimate the original value function. This discrepancy increases with stronger risk aversion and decreases as more data become available. We then utilize this adaptive property in the setting of online RL as well as online contextual multi-arm bandits (CMAB), a special case of online RL. We provide two procedures using posterior sampling for both the general RL problem and the CMAB problem. We establish a sub-linear regret bound, with the regret defined as the conventional regret for both the RL and CMAB settings. Additionally, we establish a sub-linear regret bound for the CMAB setting with the regret defined as the Bayesian risk regret. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in addressing epistemic uncertainty and verifying the theoretical properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robiul Islam, Dmitry I. Ignatov, Karl Kaberg, Roman Nabatchikov</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates classifier performance across EEG frequency bands using various optimizers and evaluates efficient class prediction for the left and right hemispheres. Three neural network architectures - a deep dense network, a shallow three-layer network, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) - are implemented and compared using the TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. Results indicate that the Adagrad and RMSprop optimizers consistently perform well across different frequency bands, with Adadelta exhibiting robust performance in cross-model evaluations. Specifically, Adagrad excels in the beta band, while RMSprop achieves superior performance in the gamma band. Conversely, SGD and FTRL exhibit inconsistent performance. Among the models, the CNN demonstrates the second highest accuracy, particularly in capturing spatial features of EEG data. The deep dense network shows competitive performance in learning complex patterns, whereas the shallow three-layer network, sometimes being less accurate, provides computational efficiency. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) plots are employed to identify efficient class prediction, revealing nuanced contributions of EEG frequency bands to model accuracy. Overall, the study highlights the importance of optimizer selection, model architecture, and EEG frequency band analysis in enhancing classifier performance and understanding feature importance in neuroimaging-based classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Brusaferri, Danial Ramin, Andrea Ballarino</p>
<p>Abstract: While neural networks are achieving high predictive accuracy in multi-horizon probabilistic forecasting, understanding the underlying mechanisms that lead to feature-conditioned outputs remains a significant challenge for forecasters. In this work, we take a further step toward addressing this critical issue by introducing the Quantile Neural Basis Model, which incorporates the interpretability principles of Quantile Generalized Additive Models into an end-to-end neural network training framework. To this end, we leverage shared basis decomposition and weight factorization, complementing Neural Models for Location, Scale, and Shape by avoiding any parametric distributional assumptions. We validate our approach on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, achieving predictive performance comparable to distributional and quantile regression neural networks, while offering valuable insights into model behavior through the learned nonlinear mappings from input features to output predictions across the horizon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kit T. Rodolfa, Erika Salomon, Jin Yao, Steve Yoder, Robert Sullivan, Kevin McGuire, Allie Dickinson, Rob MacDougall, Brian Seidler, Christina Sung, Claire Herdeman, Rayid Ghani</p>
<p>Abstract: Many incarcerated individuals face significant and complex challenges, including mental illness, substance dependence, and homelessness, yet jails and prisons are often poorly equipped to address these needs. With little support from the existing criminal justice system, these needs can remain untreated and worsen, often leading to further offenses and a cycle of incarceration with adverse outcomes both for the individual and for public safety, with particularly large impacts on communities of color that continue to widen the already extensive racial disparities in criminal justice outcomes. Responding to these failures, a growing number of criminal justice stakeholders are seeking to break this cycle through innovative approaches such as community-driven and alternative approaches to policing, mentoring, community building, restorative justice, pretrial diversion, holistic defense, and social service connections. Here we report on a collaboration between Johnson County, Kansas, and Carnegie Mellon University to perform targeted, proactive mental health outreach in an effort to reduce reincarceration rates.
  This paper describes the data used, our predictive modeling approach and results, as well as the design and analysis of a field trial conducted to confirm our model's predictive power, evaluate the impact of this targeted outreach, and understand at what level of reincarceration risk outreach might be most effective. Through this trial, we find that our model is highly predictive of new jail bookings, with more than half of individuals in the trial's highest-risk group returning to jail in the following year. Outreach was most effective among these highest-risk individuals, with impacts on mental health utilization, EMS dispatches, and criminal justice involvement.</p>

Formulated as a variational problem, this model provides a simple testbed for feature learning in compositional architectures. From the perspective of variable selection, we show how relevant variables are recovered while noise variables are eliminated. We establish guarantees showing that both global minimizers and stationary points discard noise coordinates when the noise variables are Gaussian distributed. A central finding is that $\ell_1$-type kernels, such as the Laplace kernel, succeed in recovering features contributing to nonlinear effects at stationary points, whereas Gaussian kernels recover only linear ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Rezwan Jaher, Abul Mukid Mohammad Mukaddes, A. B. M. Abdul Malek</p>
<p>Abstract: Many critical healthcare decisions are challenged by the inability to measure key underlying parameters. Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness driven by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), provides a stark example. The primary determinant of IOP, a tissue property called trabecular meshwork permeability, cannot be measured in vivo, forcing clinicians to depend on indirect surrogates. This clinical challenge is compounded by a broader computational one: developing predictive models for such ill-posed inverse problems is hindered by a lack of ground-truth data and prohibitive cost of large-scale, high-fidelity simulations. We address both challenges with an end-to-end framework to noninvasively estimate unmeasurable variables from sparse, routine data. Our approach combines a multi-stage artificial intelligence architecture to functionally separate the problem; a novel data generation strategy we term PCDS that obviates the need for hundreds of thousands of costly simulations, reducing the effective computational time from years to hours; and a Bayesian engine to quantify predictive uncertainty. Our framework deconstructs a single IOP measurement into its fundamental components from routine inputs only, yielding estimates for the unmeasurable tissue permeability and a patient's outflow facility. Our noninvasively estimated outflow facility achieved excellent agreement with state-of-the-art tonography with precision comparable to direct physical instruments. Furthermore, the newly derived permeability biomarker demonstrates high accuracy in stratifying clinical cohorts by disease risk, highlighting its diagnostic potential. More broadly, our framework establishes a generalizable blueprint for solving similar inverse problems in other data-scarce, computationally-intensive domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziming Wei, Zichen Kong, Yuan Wang, David Z. Pan, Xiyuan Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Analog and mixed-signal circuit design remains challenging due to the shortage of high-quality data and the difficulty of embedding domain knowledge into automated flows. Traditional black-box optimization achieves sampling efficiency but lacks circuit understanding, which often causes evaluations to be wasted in low-value regions of the design space. In contrast, learning-based methods embed structural knowledge but are case-specific and costly to retrain. Recent attempts with large language models show potential, yet they often rely on manual intervention, limiting generality and transparency. We propose TopoSizing, an end-to-end framework that performs robust circuit understanding directly from raw netlists and translates this knowledge into optimization gains. Our approach first applies graph algorithms to organize circuits into a hierarchical device-module-stage representation. LLM agents then execute an iterative hypothesis-verification-refinement loop with built-in consistency checks, producing explicit annotations. Verified insights are integrated into Bayesian optimization through LLM-guided initial sampling and stagnation-triggered trust-region updates, improving efficiency while preserving feasibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models and vision-language models, employing large models as Web Agents has become essential for automated web interaction. However, training Web Agents with reinforcement learning faces critical challenges including credit assignment misallocation, prohibitively high annotation costs, and reward sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Guided Preference Optimization (TGPO), an offline reinforcement learning framework that proposes a tree-structured trajectory representation merging semantically identical states across trajectories to eliminate label conflicts. Our framework incorporates a Process Reward Model that automatically generates fine-grained rewards through subgoal progress, redundancy detection, and action verification. Additionally, a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes high-impact decision points during training. Experiments on Online-Mind2Web and our self-constructed C-WebShop datasets demonstrate that TGPO significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher success rates with fewer redundant steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Hu, Jie Yang, Tian Zhou, Peiyuan Liu, Yujin Tang, Rong Jin, Liang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning techniques like contrastive learning have long been explored in time series forecasting, mirroring their success in computer vision and natural language processing. Yet recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasters seldom adopt these representation approaches because they have shown little performance advantage. We challenge this view and demonstrate that explicit representation alignment can supply critical information that bridges the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that learns auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeds them back to any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arises primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. We also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of TimeAlign in increasing the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets. As it is architecture-agnostic and incurs negligible overhead, TimeAlign can serve as a general alignment module for modern deep learning time-series forecasting systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Diego Toscano, Daniel T. Chen, Vivek Oommen, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Residual-based adaptive strategies are widely used in scientific machine learning but remain largely heuristic. We introduce a unifying variational framework that formalizes these methods by integrating convex transformations of the residual. Different transformations correspond to distinct objective functionals: exponential weights target the minimization of uniform error, while linear weights recover the minimization of quadratic error. Within this perspective, adaptive weighting is equivalent to selecting sampling distributions that optimize the primal objective, thereby linking discretization choices directly to error metrics. This principled approach yields three benefits: (1) it enables systematic design of adaptive schemes across norms, (2) reduces discretization error through variance reduction of the loss estimator, and (3) enhances learning dynamics by improving the gradient signal-to-noise ratio. Extending the framework to operator learning, we demonstrate substantial performance gains across optimizers and architectures. Our results provide a theoretical justification of residual-based adaptivity and establish a foundation for principled discretization and training strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stochastic optimization powers the scalability of modern artificial intelligence, spanning machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language model training. Yet, existing theory remains largely confined to Hilbert spaces, relying on inner-product frameworks and orthogonality. This paradigm fails to capture non-Euclidean settings, such as mirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning, natural gradient descent in information geometry, or Kullback--Leibler-regularized language model training. Unlike Euclidean-based Hilbert-space methods, this approach embraces general Banach spaces. This work introduces a pioneering Banach--Bregman framework for stochastic iterations, establishing Bregman geometry as a foundation for next-generation optimization. It (i) provides a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman--Fejer monotonicity, encompassing stochastic approximation, mirror descent, natural gradient, adaptive methods, and mirror-prox; (ii) establishes super-relaxations ($\lambda > 2$) in non-Hilbert settings, enabling flexible geometries and elucidating their acceleration effect; and (iii) delivers convergence theorems spanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated on synthetic and real-world tasks. Empirical studies across machine learning (UCI benchmarks), deep learning (e.g., Transformer training), reinforcement learning (actor--critic), and large language models (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2) show up to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over classical baselines. These results position Banach--Bregman geometry as a cornerstone unifying optimization theory and practice across core AI paradigms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data-driven modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems is often hampered by measurement noise. We propose a denoising framework, called Runge-Kutta and Total Variation Based Implicit Neural Representation (RKTV-INR), that represents the state trajectory with an implicit neural representation (INR) fitted directly to noisy observations. Runge-Kutta integration and total variation are imposed as constraints to ensure that the reconstructed state is a trajectory of a dynamical system that remains close to the original data. The trained INR yields a clean, continuous trajectory and provides accurate first-order derivatives via automatic differentiation. These denoised states and derivatives are then supplied to Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to recover the governing equations. Experiments demonstrate effective noise suppression, precise derivative estimation, and reliable system identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitrii Krasheninnikov, Richard E. Turner, David Krueger</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that language models' activations linearly encode when information was learned during training. Our setup involves creating a model with a known training order by sequentially fine-tuning Llama-3.2-1B on six disjoint but otherwise similar datasets about named entities. We find that the average activations of test samples for the six training datasets encode the training order: when projected into a 2D subspace, these centroids are arranged exactly in the order of training and lie on a straight line. Further, we show that linear probes can accurately (~90%) distinguish "early" vs. "late" entities, generalizing to entities unseen during the probes' own training. The model can also be fine-tuned to explicitly report an unseen entity's training stage (~80% accuracy). Interestingly, this temporal signal does not seem attributable to simple differences in activation magnitudes, losses, or model confidence. Our paper demonstrates that models are capable of differentiating information by its acquisition time, and carries significant implications for how they might manage conflicting data and respond to knowledge modifications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence applications have raised new data security concerns. This paper focuses on defending diffusion models against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when the attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model. Although diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership inference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The defense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin dynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion process along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary variables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data earlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated and validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengting Ai, Tianxin Wei, Sirui Chen, Jingrui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured pruning of large language models (LLMs) offers substantial efficiency improvements by removing entire hidden units, yet current approaches often suffer from significant performance degradation, particularly in zero-shot settings, and necessitate costly recovery techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or adapter insertion. To address these critical shortcomings, we introduce NIRVANA, a novel pruning method explicitly designed to balance immediate zero-shot accuracy preservation with robust fine-tuning capability. Leveraging a first-order saliency criterion derived from the Neural Tangent Kernel under Adam optimization dynamics, NIRVANA provides a theoretically grounded pruning strategy that respects essential model training behaviors. To further address the unique challenges posed by structured pruning, NIRVANA incorporates an adaptive sparsity allocation mechanism across layers and modules (attention vs. MLP), which adjusts pruning intensity between modules in a globally balanced manner. Additionally, to mitigate the high sensitivity of pruning decisions to calibration data quality, we propose a simple yet effective KL divergence-based calibration data selection strategy, ensuring more reliable and task-agnostic pruning outcomes. Comprehensive experiments conducted on Llama3, Qwen, and T5 models demonstrate that NIRVANA outperforms existing structured pruning methods under equivalent sparsity constraints, providing a theoretically sound and practical approach to LLM compression.

<p>Abstract: Where do learning signals come from when there is no ground truth in post-training? We propose turning exploration into supervision through Compute as Teacher (CaT), which converts the model's own exploration at inference-time into reference-free supervision by synthesizing a single reference from a group of parallel rollouts and then optimizing toward it. Concretely, the current policy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy) reconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra inference-time compute into a teacher signal. We turn this into rewards in two regimes: (i) verifiable tasks use programmatic equivalence on final answers; (ii) non-verifiable tasks use self-proposed rubrics-binary, auditable criteria scored by an independent LLM judge, with reward given by the fraction satisfied. Unlike selection methods (best-of-N, majority, perplexity, or judge scores), synthesis may disagree with the majority and be correct even when all rollouts are wrong; performance scales with the number of rollouts. As a test-time procedure, CaT improves Gemma 3 4B, Qwen 3 4B, and Llama 3.1 8B (up to +27% on MATH-500; +12% on HealthBench). With reinforcement learning (CaT-RL), we obtain further gains (up to +33% and +30%), with the trained policy surpassing the initial teacher signal.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) is embedded in billions of devices, yet its optical waveform is easily corrupted by motion, perfusion loss, and ambient light, jeopardizing downstream cardiometric analytics. Existing signal-quality assessment (SQA) methods rely either on brittle heuristics or on data-hungry supervised models. We introduce the first fully unsupervised SQA pipeline for wrist PPG. Stage 1 trains a contrastive 1-D ResNet-18 on 276 h of raw, unlabeled data from heterogeneous sources (varying in device and sampling frequency), yielding optical-emitter- and motion-invariant embeddings (i.e., the learned representation is stable across differences in LED wavelength, drive intensity, and device optics, as well as wrist motion). Stage 2 converts each 512-D encoder embedding into a 4-D topological signature via persistent homology (PH) and clusters these signatures with HDBSCAN. To produce a binary signal-quality index (SQI), the acceptable PPG signals are represented by the densest cluster while the remaining clusters are assumed to mainly contain poor-quality PPG signals. Without re-tuning, the SQI attains Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz scores of 0.72, 0.34, and 6173, respectively, on a stratified sample of 10,000 windows. In this study, we propose a hybrid self-supervised-learning--topological-data-analysis (SSL--TDA) framework that offers a drop-in, scalable, cross-device quality gate for PPG signals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hemil Mehta, Tanvi Raut, Kohav Yadav, Edward F. Gehringer</p>
<p>Abstract: This full research-to-practice paper explores approaches for developing course chatbots by comparing low-code platforms and custom-coded solutions in educational contexts. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA, LLM-based chatbots are being integrated into teaching workflows to automate tasks, provide assistance, and offer scalable support. However, selecting the optimal development strategy requires balancing ease of use, customization, data privacy, and scalability. This study compares two development approaches: low-code platforms like AnythingLLM and Botpress, with custom-coded solutions using LangChain, FAISS, and FastAPI. The research uses Prompt engineering, Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and personalization to evaluate chatbot prototypes across technical performance, scalability, and user experience. Findings indicate that while low-code platforms enable rapid prototyping, they face limitations in customization and scaling, while custom-coded systems offer more control but require significant technical expertise. Both approaches successfully implement key research principles such as adaptive feedback loops and conversational continuity. The study provides a framework for selecting the appropriate development strategy based on institutional goals and resources. Future work will focus on hybrid solutions that combine low-code accessibility with modular customization and incorporate multimodal input for intelligent tutoring systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anand Swaroop, Akshat Nallani, Saksham Uboweja, Adiliia Uzdenova, Michael Nguyen, Kevin Zhu, Sunishchal Dev, Ashwinee Panda, Vasu Sharma, Maheep Chaudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for improving large language model performance on complex tasks, but recent work shows that reasoning steps often fail to causally influence the final answer, creating brittle and untrustworthy outputs. Prior approaches focus primarily on measuring faithfulness, while methods for systematically improving it remain limited. We introduce Faithful Reasoning via Intervention Training (FRIT), a scalable alignment method that trains models to produce causally consistent reasoning by learning from systematically corrupted examples. FRIT generates synthetic training data by intervening on individual reasoning steps in model-generated CoTs, creating faithful/unfaithful pairs that highlight when reasoning breaks down. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization to teach models to prefer causally consistent reasoning paths. Evaluating on Qwen3-8B and Mistral-7B-v0.1 across factual and symbolic reasoning tasks, FRIT increases faithful reasoning by $3.4$ percentage points for Mistral on GSM8K while improving accuracy by $7.6$ percentage points. Our approach provides the first scalable, supervision-free method for training language models to produce more reliable and interpretable reasoning, addressing a critical gap between reasoning performance and trustworthiness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehran Behjati, Rosdiadee Nordin, Nor Fadzilah Abdullah</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach for path planning of cellular connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLoS). The objective is to minimize travel distance while maximizing the quality of cellular link connectivity by considering real world aerial coverage constraints and employing an empirical aerial channel model. The proposed solution employs RL techniques to train an agent, using the quality of communication links between the UAV and base stations (BSs) as the reward function. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in training the agent and generating feasible UAV path plans. The proposed approach addresses the challenges due to limitations in UAV cellular communications, highlighting the need for investigations and considerations in this area. The RL algorithm efficiently identifies optimal paths, ensuring maximum connectivity with ground BSs to ensure safe and reliable BVLoS flight operation. Moreover, the solution can be deployed as an offline path planning module that can be integrated into future ground control systems (GCS) for UAV operations, enhancing their capabilities and safety. The method holds potential for complex long range UAV applications, advancing the technology in the field of cellular connected UAV path planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hassan Gharoun, Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi, Kasra Ranjbarigderi, Fang Chen, Amir H. Gandomi</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evidence-conditioned tagging provides a more reliable and interpretable alternative to fixed prediction entropy thresholds for operational uncertainty-aware decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training agents to act in embodied environments typically requires vast training data or access to accurate simulation, neither of which exists for many cases in the real world. Instead, world models are emerging as an alternative leveraging offline, passively collected data, they make it possible to generate diverse worlds for training agents in simulation. In this work, we harness world models to generate imagined environments to train robust agents capable of generalizing to novel task variations. One of the challenges in doing this is ensuring the agent trains on useful generated data. We thus propose a novel approach, IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), leveraging Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which induces an automatic curriculum over generated worlds. In a series of challenging, procedurally generated environments, we show it is possible to achieve strong transfer performance on held-out environments, having trained only inside a world model learned from a narrower dataset. We believe this opens the path to utilizing larger-scale, foundation world models for generally capable agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Ishtyaq Mahmud, Veena Kochat, Suresh Satpati, Jagan Mohan Reddy Dwarampudi, Kunal Rai, Tania Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for evaluating dimensionality reduction techniques in spatial transcriptomics beyond standard PCA approaches. We benchmark six methods PCA, NMF, autoencoder, VAE, and two hybrid embeddings on a cholangiocarcinoma Xenium dataset, systematically varying latent dimensions ($k$=5-40) and clustering resolutions ($\rho$=0.1-1.2). Each configuration is evaluated using complementary metrics including reconstruction error, explained variance, cluster cohesion, and two novel biologically-motivated measures: Cluster Marker Coherence (CMC) and Marker Exclusion Rate (MER). Our results demonstrate distinct performance profiles: PCA provides a fast baseline, NMF maximizes marker enrichment, VAE balances reconstruction and interpretability, while autoencoders occupy a middle ground. We provide systematic hyperparameter selection using Pareto optimal analysis and demonstrate how MER-guided reassignment improves biological fidelity across all methods, with CMC scores improving by up to 12\% on average. This framework enables principled selection of dimensionality reduction methods tailored to specific spatial transcriptomics analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Li, Weiwei Yi, Jiahong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) permeate everyday decision-making, their epistemic and societal risks demand urgent scrutiny. Hallucinations, the generation of fabricated, misleading, oversimplified or untrustworthy outputs, has emerged as imperative challenges. While regulatory, academic, and technical discourse position accuracy as the principal benchmark for mitigating such harms, this article contends that overreliance on accuracy misdiagnoses the problem and has counterproductive effect: the accuracy paradox. Drawing on interdisciplinary literatures, this article develops a taxonomy of hallucination types and shows the paradox along three intertwining dimensions: outputs, individuals and society. First, accuracy functions as a superficial proxy for reliability, incentivising the optimisation of rhetorical fluency and surface-level correctness over epistemic trustworthiness. This encourages passive user trust in outputs that appear accurate but epistemically untenable. Second, accuracy as a singular metric fails to detect harms that are not factually false but are nonetheless misleading, value-laden, or socially distorting, including consensus illusions, sycophantic alignment, and subtle manipulation. Third, regulatory overemphasis on accuracy obscures the wider societal consequences of hallucination, including social sorting, privacy violations, equity harms, epistemic convergence that marginalises dissent, reduces pluralism, and causes social deskilling. By examining the EU AI Act, GDPR, and DSA, the article argues that current regulations are not yet structurally equipped to address these epistemic, relational, and systemic harms and exacerbated by the overreliance on accuracy. By exposing such conceptual and practical challenges, this article calls for a fundamental shift towards pluralistic, context-aware, and manipulation-resilient approaches to AI trustworthy governance.</p>

Using point clouds tokenized from meshes and a ShapeNet-pretrained Point-JEPA encoder, we train a lightweight multi-hypothesis head with winner-takes-all and evaluate by top-logit selection. On DLR-Hand II with object-level splits, Point-JEPA reduces RMSE by up to 26% in low-label regimes and reaches parity with full supervision.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Adnan Shahzad</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a systematic comparison between hybrid quantum-classical neural networks and purely classical models across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10) to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and robustness. The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and adversarial robustness (tested with $\epsilon=0.1$ perturbations).Key findings demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in final accuracy, achieving {99.38\% (MNIST), 41.69\% (CIFAR100), and 74.05\% (STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21\%, 32.25\%, and 63.76\%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44\%) and STL10 (+10.29\%). Hybrid models also train 5--12$\times$ faster (e.g., 21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 6--32\% fewer parameters} while maintaining superior generalization to unseen test data.Adversarial robustness tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler datasets (e.g., 45.27\% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80\% for classical) but show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 ($\sim$1\% robustness for both). Resource efficiency analyses indicate that hybrid models consume less memory (4--5GB vs. 5--6GB for classical) and lower CPU utilization (9.5\% vs. 23.2\% on average).These results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures offer compelling advantages in accuracy, training efficiency, and parameter scalability, particularly for complex vision tasks.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13355">Synthetic Data and the Shifting Ground of Truth</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dietmar Offenhuber</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of synthetic data for privacy protection, training data generation, or simply convenient access to quasi-realistic data in any shape or volume complicates the concept of ground truth. Synthetic data mimic real-world observations, but do not refer to external features. This lack of a representational relationship, however, not prevent researchers from using synthetic data as training data for AI models and ground truth repositories. It is claimed that the lack of data realism is not merely an acceptable tradeoff, but often leads to better model performance than realistic data: compensate for known biases, prevent overfitting and support generalization, and make the models more robust in dealing with unexpected outliers. Indeed, injecting noisy and outright implausible data into training sets can be beneficial for the model. This greatly complicates usual assumptions based on which representational accuracy determines data fidelity (garbage in - garbage out). Furthermore, ground truth becomes a self-referential affair, in which the labels used as a ground truth repository are themselves synthetic products of a generative model and as such not connected to real-world observations. My paper examines how ML researchers and practitioners bootstrap ground truth under such paradoxical circumstances without relying on the stable ground of representation and real-world reference. It will also reflect on the broader implications of a shift from a representational to what could be described as a mimetic or iconic concept of data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> L. Zimmer, J. Weidner, M. Balcerak, F. Kofler, I. Ezhov, B. Menze, B. Wiestler</p>
<p>Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain malignancy, distinguished by its highly invasive behavior and exceptionally high rates of recurrence. Conventional radiation therapy, which employs uniform treatment margins, fails to account for patient-specific anatomical and biological factors that critically influence tumor cell migration. To address this limitation, numerous computational models of glioblastoma growth have been developed, enabling generation of tumor cell distribution maps extending beyond radiographically visible regions and thus informing more precise treatment strategies. However, despite encouraging preliminary findings, the clinical adoption of these growth models remains limited. To bridge this translational gap and accelerate both model development and clinical validation, we introduce PREDICT-GBM, a comprehensive integrated pipeline and dataset for modeling and evaluation. This platform enables systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art tumor growth models using an expert-curated clinical dataset comprising 255 subjects with complete tumor segmentations and tissue characterization maps. Our analysis demonstrates that personalized radiation treatment plans derived from tumor growth predictions achieved superior recurrence coverage compared to conventional uniform margin approaches for two of the evaluated models. This work establishes a robust platform for advancing and systematically evaluating cutting-edge tumor growth modeling approaches, with the ultimate goal of facilitating clinical translation and improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Wei, Xiaohan Shan, Ran Miao, Jianmin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning agent development traditionally requires extensive expertise and lengthy iterations, often resulting in high failure rates and limited accessibility. This paper introduces $Agent^2$, a novel agent-generates-agent framework that achieves fully automated RL agent design through intelligent LLM-driven generation. The system autonomously transforms natural language task descriptions and environment code into comprehensive, high-performance reinforcement learning solutions without human intervention. $Agent^2$ features a revolutionary dual-agent architecture. The Generator Agent serves as an autonomous AI designer that analyzes tasks and generates executable RL agents, while the Target Agent is the resulting automatically generated RL agent. The framework decomposes RL development into two distinct stages: MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, enabling more targeted and effective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, $Agent^2$ provides a unified framework that standardizes intelligent agent creation across diverse environments and algorithms, while incorporating adaptive training management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous improvement. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including MuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC, demonstrate that $Agent^2$ consistently outperforms manually designed solutions across all tasks, achieving up to 55% performance improvement and substantial gains on average. By enabling truly end-to-end, closed-loop automation, this work establishes a new paradigm in which intelligent agents design and optimize other agents, marking a fundamental breakthrough for automated AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) is an effective method for load shifting and demand response in buildings. Optimal TES control and management are essential to improve the performance of the cooling system. Most existing TES systems operate on a fixed schedule, which cannot take full advantage of its load shifting capability, and requires extensive investigation and optimization. This study proposed a novel integrated load prediction and optimized control approach for ice-based TES in commercial buildings. A cooling load prediction model was developed and a mid-day modification mechanism was introduced into the prediction model to improve the accuracy. Based on the predictions, a rule-based control strategy was proposed according to the time-of-use tariff; the mid-day control adjustment mechanism was introduced in accordance with the mid-day prediction modifications. The proposed approach was applied in the ice-based TES system of a commercial complex in Beijing, and achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 389 kW and coefficient of variance of MAE of 12.5%. The integrated prediction-based control strategy achieved an energy cost saving rate of 9.9%. The proposed model was deployed in the realistic building automation system of the case building and significantly improved the efficiency and automation of the cooling system.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of pricing exotic options and structured products, which traditional models often fail to handle due to their inability to capture real-world market phenomena like fat-tailed distributions and volatility clustering. We introduce a Diffusion-Conditional Probability Model (DDPM) to generate more realistic price paths. Our method incorporates a composite loss function with financial-specific features, and we propose a P-Q dynamic game framework for evaluating the model's economic value through adversarial backtesting. Static validation shows our P-model effectively matches market mean and volatility. In dynamic games, it demonstrates significantly higher profitability than a traditional Monte Carlo-based model for European and Asian options. However, the model shows limitations in pricing products highly sensitive to extreme events, such as snowballs and accumulators, because it tends to underestimate tail risks. The study concludes that diffusion models hold significant potential for enhancing pricing accuracy, though further research is needed to improve their ability to model extreme market risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hansol Lim, Minhyeok Im, Jonathan Boyack, Jee Won Lee, Jongseong Brad Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Demands for software-defined vehicles (SDV) are rising and electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly being equipped with powerful computers. This enables onboard AI systems to optimize charge-aware path optimization customized to reflect vehicle's current condition and environment. We present VEGA, a charge-aware EV navigation agent that plans over a charger-annotated road graph using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with budgeted A* teacher-student guidance under state-of-charge (SoC) feasibility. VEGA consists of two modules. First, a physics-informed neural operator (PINO), trained on real vehicle speed and battery-power logs, uses recent vehicle speed logs to estimate aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, mass, motor and regenerative-braking efficiencies, and auxiliary load by learning a vehicle-custom dynamics. Second, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent uses these dynamics to optimize a path with optimal charging stops and dwell times under SoC constraints. VEGA requires no additional sensors and uses only vehicle speed signals. It may serve as a virtual sensor for power and efficiency to potentially reduce EV cost. In evaluation on long routes like San Francisco to New York, VEGA's stops, dwell times, SoC management, and total travel time closely track Tesla Trip Planner while being slightly more conservative, presumably due to real vehicle conditions such as vehicle parameter drift due to deterioration. Although trained only in U.S. regions, VEGA was able to compute optimal charge-aware paths in France and Japan, demonstrating generalizability. It achieves practical integration of physics-informed learning and RL for EV eco-routing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepti Kunte, Bram Cornelis, Claudio Colangeli, Karl Janssens, Brecht Van Baelen, Konstantinos Gryllias</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection of anomalies in automotive cabin sounds is critical for ensuring vehicle quality and maintaining passenger comfort. In many real-world settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set to support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a high-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin sounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation, Whine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced sound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been made publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental evaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models using proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently demonstrated the ability to perform Speech In-Context Learning (SICL). Selecting effective in-context examples is crucial for SICL performance, yet selection methodologies remain underexplored. In this work, we propose Text-Embedding KNN for SICL (TICL), a simple pipeline that uses semantic context to enhance off-the-shelf large multimodal models' speech recognition ability without fine-tuning. Across challenging automatic speech recognition tasks, including accented English, multilingual speech, and children's speech, our method enables models to surpass zero-shot performance with up to 84.7% relative WER reduction. We conduct ablation studies to show the robustness and efficiency of our method.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13399">EdiVal-Agent: An Object-Centric Framework for Automated, Scalable, Fine-Grained Evaluation of Multi-Turn Editing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Chen, Yasi Zhang, Zhi Zhang, Peiyu Yu, Shu Wang, Zhendong Wang, Kevin Lin, Xiaofei Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Linjie Li, Chung-Ching Lin, Jianwen Xie, Oscar Leong, Lijuan Wang, Ying Nian Wu, Mingyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise.
  To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation, it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over time.
  Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1), flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models.

<p>Abstract: We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets, along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a universal 3D reconstruction backbone.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce SteeringControl, a benchmark for evaluating representation steering methods across core alignment objectives--bias, harmful generation, and hallucination--and their effects on secondary behaviors such as sycophancy and commonsense morality. While prior alignment work often highlights truthfulness or reasoning ability to demonstrate the side effects of representation steering, we find there are many unexplored tradeoffs not yet understood in a systematic way. We collect a dataset of safety-relevant primary and secondary behaviors to evaluate steering effectiveness and behavioral entanglement centered around five popular steering methods. To enable this, we craft a modular steering framework based on unique components that serve as the building blocks of many existing methods. Our results on Qwen-2.5-7B and Llama-3.1-8B find that strong steering performance is dependent on the specific combination of steering method, model, and targeted behavior, and that severe concept entanglement can result from poor combinations of these three as well.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arna Ghosh, Zahraa Chorghay, Shahab Bakhtiari, Blake A. Richards</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological and artificial intelligence systems navigate the fundamental efficiency-robustness tradeoff for optimal encoding, i.e., they must efficiently encode numerous attributes of the input space while also being robust to noise. This challenge is particularly evident in hierarchical processing systems like the human brain. With a view towards understanding how systems navigate the efficiency-robustness tradeoff, we turned to a population geometry framework for analyzing representations in the human visual cortex alongside artificial neural networks (ANNs). In the ventral visual stream, we found general-purpose, scale-free representations characterized by a power law-decaying eigenspectrum in most areas. However, in certain higher-order visual areas did not have scale-free representations, indicating that scale-free geometry is not a universal property of the brain. In parallel, ANNs trained with a self-supervised learning objective also exhibited free-free geometry, but not after fine-tune on a specific task. Based on these empirical results and our analytical insights, we posit that a system's representation geometry is not a universal property and instead depends upon the computational objective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Masud Rana, Farjana Tasnim Mukta, Duc D. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: In structure-based drug design, accurately estimating the binding affinity between a candidate ligand and its protein receptor is a central challenge. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated superior performance over traditional empirical and physics-based methods for this task, enabled by the growing availability of structural and experimental affinity data. In this work, we introduce DeepGGL, a deep convolutional neural network that integrates residual connections and an attention mechanism within a geometric graph learning framework. By leveraging multiscale weighted colored bipartite subgraphs, DeepGGL effectively captures fine-grained atom-level interactions in protein-ligand complexes across multiple scales. We benchmarked DeepGGL against established models on CASF-2013 and CASF-2016, where it achieved state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across diverse evaluation metrics. To further assess robustness and generalization, we tested the model on the CSAR-NRC-HiQ dataset and the PDBbind v2019 holdout set. DeepGGL consistently maintained high predictive accuracy, highlighting its adaptability and reliability for binding affinity prediction in structure-based drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajatsubhra Chakraborty, Xujun Che, Depeng Xu, Cori Faklaris, Xi Niu, Shuhan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Bias discovery is critical for black-box generative models, especiall text-to-image (TTI) models. Existing works predominantly focus on output-level demographic distributions, which do not necessarily guarantee concept representations to be disentangled post-mitigation. We propose BiasMap, a model-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational biases in stable diffusion models. BiasMap leverages cross-attention attribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics (e.g., gender, race) and semantics (e.g., professions), going deeper into representational bias during the image generation. Using attribution maps of these concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics-semantics concept entanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that remains hidden in existing fairness discovery approaches. In addition, we further utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion sampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected SoftIoU during the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness interventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to disentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate concept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional bias mitigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) scene understanding in colonoscopy presents significant challenges that necessitate automated methods for accurate depth estimation. However, existing depth estimation models for endoscopy struggle with temporal consistency across video sequences, limiting their applicability for 3D reconstruction. We present ColonCrafter, a diffusion-based depth estimation model that generates temporally consistent depth maps from monocular colonoscopy videos. Our approach learns robust geometric priors from synthetic colonoscopy sequences to generate temporally consistent depth maps. We also introduce a style transfer technique that preserves geometric structure while adapting real clinical videos to match our synthetic training domain. ColonCrafter achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the C3VD dataset, outperforming both general-purpose and endoscopy-specific approaches. Although full trajectory 3D reconstruction remains a challenge, we demonstrate clinically relevant applications of ColonCrafter, including 3D point cloud generation and surface coverage assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongfei Guo, Lili Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation, trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms [1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals that prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates. Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present TreeIRL, a novel planner for autonomous driving that combines Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in simulation and in real-world driving. The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Jeongjin (Jayjay),  Park, Grant Bruer, Huseyin Tuna Erdinc, Abhinav Prakash Gahlot, Felix J. Herrmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate's gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO's potential to offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed across diverse applications. This often includes tasks LLMs have not encountered during training. This implies that enumerating and obtaining the high-quality training data for all tasks is infeasible. Thus, we often need to rely on transfer learning using datasets with different characteristics, and anticipate out-of-distribution requests. Motivated by this practical need, we propose an analysis framework, building a transfer learning matrix and dimensionality reduction, to dissect these cross-task interactions. We train and analyze 10 models to identify latent abilities (e.g., Reasoning, Sentiment Classification, NLU, Arithmetic) and discover the side effects of the transfer learning. Our findings reveal that performance improvements often defy explanations based on surface-level dataset similarity or source data quality. Instead, hidden statistical factors of the source dataset, such as class distribution and generation length proclivities, alongside specific linguistic features, are actually more influential. This work offers insights into the complex dynamics of transfer learning, paving the way for more predictable and effective LLM adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mert G\"urb\"uzbalaban, Yasa Syed, Necdet Serhat Aybat</p>
<p>Abstract: We study trade-offs between convergence rate and robustness to gradient errors in first-order methods. Our focus is on generalized momentum methods (GMMs), a class that includes Nesterov's accelerated gradient, heavy-ball, and gradient descent. We allow stochastic gradient errors that may be adversarial and biased, and quantify robustness via the risk-sensitive index (RSI) from robust control theory. For quadratic objectives with i.i.d. Gaussian noise, we give closed-form expressions for RSI using 2x2 Riccati equations, revealing a Pareto frontier between RSI and convergence rate over stepsize and momentum choices. We prove a large-deviation principle for time-averaged suboptimality and show that the rate function is, up to scaling, the convex conjugate of the RSI. We further connect RSI to the $H_{\infty}$-norm, showing that stronger worst-case robustness (smaller $H_{\infty}$ norm) yields sharper decay of tail probabilities. Beyond quadratics, under biased sub-Gaussian gradient errors, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on a finite-time analogue of the RSI, giving finite-time high-probability guarantees and large-deviation bounds. We also observe an analogous trade-off between RSI and convergence-rate bounds for smooth strongly convex functions. To our knowledge, these are the first non-asymptotic guarantees and risk-sensitive analysis of GMMs with biased gradients. Numerical experiments on robust regression illustrate the results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Ren, Yulin Wu, Shuhan Qi, Jiajia Zhang, Xiaozhen Sun, Tianzi Ma, Xuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Regret minimization is a powerful method for finding Nash equilibria in Normal-Form Games (NFGs) and Extensive-Form Games (EFGs), but it typically guarantees convergence only for the average strategy. However, computing the average strategy requires significant computational resources or introduces additional errors, limiting its practical applicability. The Reward Transformation (RT) framework was introduced to regret minimization to achieve last-iterate convergence through reward function regularization. However, it faces practical challenges: its performance is highly sensitive to manually tuned parameters, which often deviate from theoretical convergence conditions, leading to slow convergence, oscillations, or stagnation in local optima.
  Inspired by previous work, we propose an adaptive technique to address these issues, ensuring better consistency between theoretical guarantees and practical performance for RT Regret Matching (RTRM), RT Counterfactual Regret Minimization (RTCFR), and their variants in solving NFGs and EFGs more effectively. Our adaptive methods dynamically adjust parameters, balancing exploration and exploitation while improving regret accumulation, ultimately enhancing asymptotic last-iterate convergence and achieving linear convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly accelerate convergence, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Koki Chinzei, Quoc Hoan Tran, Norifumi Matsumoto, Yasuhiro Endo, Hirotaka Oshima</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great promise for extracting insights from complex quantum many-body data obtained in quantum experiments. This approach can efficiently solve certain quantum problems that are classically intractable, suggesting potential advantages of harnessing quantum data. However, addressing large-scale problems still requires significant amounts of data beyond the limited computational resources of near-term quantum devices. We propose a scalable ML framework called Geometrically Local Quantum Kernel (GLQK), designed to efficiently learn quantum many-body experimental data by leveraging the exponential decay of correlations, a phenomenon prevalent in noncritical systems. In the task of learning an unknown polynomial of quantum expectation values, we rigorously prove that GLQK substantially improves polynomial sample complexity in the number of qubits $n$, compared to the existing shadow kernel, by constructing a feature space from local quantum information at the correlation length scale. This improvement is particularly notable when each term of the target polynomial involves few local subsystems. Remarkably, for translationally symmetric data, GLQK achieves constant sample complexity, independent of $n$. We numerically demonstrate its high scalability in two learning tasks on quantum many-body phenomena. These results establish new avenues for utilizing experimental data to advance the understanding of quantum many-body physics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge into large language models to improve response quality. However, recent work has shown that RAG systems are highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious texts are inserted into the knowledge database to influence model outputs. While several defenses have been proposed, they are often circumvented by more adaptive or sophisticated attacks.
  This paper presents RAGOrigin, a black-box responsibility attribution framework designed to identify which texts in the knowledge database are responsible for misleading or incorrect generations. Our method constructs a focused attribution scope tailored to each misgeneration event and assigns a responsibility score to each candidate text by evaluating its retrieval ranking, semantic relevance, and influence on the generated response. The system then isolates poisoned texts using an unsupervised clustering method. We evaluate RAGOrigin across seven datasets and fifteen poisoning attacks, including newly developed adaptive poisoning strategies and multi-attacker scenarios. Our approach outperforms existing baselines in identifying poisoned content and remains robust under dynamic and noisy conditions. These results suggest that RAGOrigin provides a practical and effective solution for tracing the origins of corrupted knowledge in RAG systems.</p>

We furthermore show that the gradient of such a circuit can be computed directly in hardware, using a procedure we call hardware linearization. This allows the network to be trained in hardware, which we demonstrate with a device-level circuit simulation. We extend the results to cascades of resistor-diode networks, which can be used to implement feedforward and other asymmetric networks. We finally show that different nonlinear elements give rise to different activation functions, and introduce the novel diode ReLU which is induced by a non-ideal diode model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Analog quantum simulators provide access to many-body dynamics beyond the reach of classical computation. However, extracting physical insights from experimental data is often hindered by measurement noise, limited observables, and incomplete knowledge of the underlying microscopic model. Here, we develop a machine learning approach based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) to analyze interference measurements of tunnel-coupled one-dimensional Bose gases, which realize the sine-Gordon quantum field theory. Trained in an unsupervised manner, the VAE learns a minimal latent representation that strongly correlates with the equilibrium control parameter of the system. Applied to non-equilibrium protocols, the latent space uncovers signatures of frozen-in solitons following rapid cooling, and reveals anomalous post-quench dynamics not captured by conventional correlation-based methods. These results demonstrate that generative models can extract physically interpretable variables directly from noisy and sparse experimental data, providing complementary probes of equilibrium and non-equilibrium physics in quantum simulators. More broadly, our work highlights how machine learning can supplement established field-theoretical techniques, paving the way for scalable, data-driven discovery in quantum many-body systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Puru Vaish, Felix Meister, Tobias Heimann, Christoph Brune, Jelmer M. Wolterink</p>
<p>Abstract: Many recent approaches in representation learning implicitly assume that uncorrelated views of a data point are sufficient to learn meaningful representations for various downstream tasks. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that meaningful structure in the latent space does not emerge naturally. Instead, it must be explicitly induced. We propose a method that aligns representations from different views of the data to align complementary information without inducing false positives. Our experiments show that our proposed self-supervised learning method, Consistent View Alignment, improves performance for downstream tasks, highlighting the critical role of structured view alignment in learning effective representations. Our method achieved first and second place in the MICCAI 2025 SSL3D challenge when using a Primus vision transformer and ResEnc convolutional neural network, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Pan, Jiaming Xu, Yongkang Zhou, Guohao Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature caching has recently emerged as a promising method for diffusion model acceleration. It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused by high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference process of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff} achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information, \textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing the Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chu Chen, Ander Biguri, Jean-Michel Morel, Raymond H. Chan, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb, Jizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: X-ray Computed Laminography (CL) is essential for non-destructive inspection of plate-like structures in applications such as microchips and composite battery materials, where traditional computed tomography (CT) struggles due to geometric constraints. However, reconstructing high-quality volumes from laminographic projections remains challenging, particularly under highly sparse-view acquisition conditions. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction algorithm, namely LamiGauss, that combines Gaussian Splatting radiative rasterization with a dedicated detector-to-world transformation model incorporating the laminographic tilt angle. LamiGauss leverages an initialization strategy that explicitly filters out common laminographic artifacts from the preliminary reconstruction, preventing redundant Gaussians from being allocated to false structures and thereby concentrating model capacity on representing the genuine object. Our approach effectively optimizes directly from sparse projections, enabling accurate and efficient reconstruction with limited data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over existing techniques. LamiGauss uses only 3$\%$ of full views to achieve superior performance over the iterative method optimized on a full dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Janne Laakkonen, Ivan Kukanov, Ville Hautam\"aki</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models such as Wav2Vec2 excel at representation learning in speech tasks, including audio deepfake detection. However, after being fine-tuned on a fixed set of bonafide and spoofed audio clips, they often fail to generalize to novel deepfake methods not represented in training. To address this, we propose a mixture-of-LoRA-experts approach that integrates multiple low-rank adapters (LoRA) into the model's attention layers. A routing mechanism selectively activates specialized experts, enhancing adaptability to evolving deepfake attacks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms standard fine-tuning in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, reducing equal error rates relative to baseline models. Notably, our best MoE-LoRA model lowers the average out-of-domain EER from 8.55\% to 6.08\%, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving generalizable audio deepfake detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixion Chen, Jiangzhou Wang, and Hyundong Shin, Arumugam Nallanathan</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reliable and energy-efficient data collection from spatially distributed devices holds great promise in supporting diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, the limited endurance and communication range of UAVs necessitate intelligent trajectory planning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively explored for UAV trajectory optimization, its interactive nature entails high costs and risks in real-world environments. Offline RL mitigates these issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on expert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy efficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first transformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved optimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language model (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework, termed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we incorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value guidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets. Furthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we employ a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid adaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms benchmark online and offline RL methods, achieving up to 36.7\% higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art DT approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Voudouris, Andrew Barron, Marta Halina, Colin Klein, Matishalin Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: Transitional accounts of evolution emphasise a few changes that shape what is evolvable, with dramatic consequences for derived lineages. More recently it has been proposed that cognition might also have evolved via a series of major transitions that manipulate the structure of biological neural networks, fundamentally changing the flow of information. We used idealised models of information flow, artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate whether changes in information flow in a network can yield a transitional change in cognitive performance. We compared networks with feed-forward, recurrent and laminated topologies, and tested their performance learning artificial grammars that differed in complexity, controlling for network size and resources. We documented a qualitative expansion in the types of input that recurrent networks can process compared to feed-forward networks, and a related qualitative increase in performance for learning the most complex grammars. We also noted how the difficulty in training recurrent networks poses a form of transition barrier and contingent irreversibility -- other key features of evolutionary transitions. Not all changes in network topology confer a performance advantage in this task set. Laminated networks did not outperform non-laminated networks in grammar learning. Overall, our findings show how some changes in information flow can yield transitions in cognitive performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present our submission to the Tenth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT25) Shared Task on Automated Translation Quality Evaluation.
  Our systems are built upon the COMET framework and trained to predict segment-level Error Span Annotation (ESA) scores using augmented long-context data.
  To construct long-context training data, we concatenate in-domain, human-annotated sentences and compute a weighted average of their scores.
  We integrate multiple human judgment datasets (MQM, SQM, and DA) by normalising their scales and train multilingual regression models to predict quality scores from the source, hypothesis, and reference translations.
  Experimental results show that incorporating long-context information improves correlations with human judgments compared to models trained only on short segments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Colin Hong, Xu Guo, Anand Chaanan Singh, Esha Choukse, Dmitrii Ustiugov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has gained increasing attention for improving LLM reasoning performance at test time without retraining the model. A notable TTS technique is Self-Consistency (SC), which generates multiple reasoning chains in parallel and selects the final answer via majority voting. While effective, the order-of-magnitude computational overhead limits its broad deployment. Prior attempts to accelerate SC mainly rely on model-based confidence scores or heuristics with limited empirical support. For the first time, we theoretically and empirically analyze the inefficiencies of SC and reveal actionable opportunities for improvement. Building on these insights, we propose Slim-SC, a step-wise pruning strategy that identifies and removes redundant chains using inter-chain similarity at the thought level. Experiments on three STEM reasoning datasets and two recent LLM architectures show that Slim-SC reduces inference latency and KVC usage by up to 45% and 26%, respectively, with R1-Distill, while maintaining or improving accuracy, thus offering a simple yet efficient TTS alternative for SC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elena Camuffo, Francesco Barbato, Mete Ozay, Simone Milani, Umberto Michieli</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models, proving its suitability for real-world deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Hala, a family of Arabic-centric instruction and translation models built with our translate-and-tune pipeline. We first compress a strong AR$\leftrightarrow$EN teacher to FP8 (yielding $\sim$2$\times$ higher throughput with no quality loss) and use it to create high-fidelity bilingual supervision. A lightweight language model LFM2-1.2B is then fine-tuned on this data and used to translate high-quality English instruction sets into Arabic, producing a million-scale corpus tailored to instruction following. We train Hala models at 350M, 700M, 1.2B, and 9B parameters, and apply slerp merging to balance Arabic specialization with base-model strengths. On Arabic-centric benchmarks, Hala achieves state-of-the-art results within both the "nano" ($\leq$2B) and "small" (7-9B) categories, outperforming their bases. We release models, data, evaluation, and recipes to accelerate research in Arabic NLP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felipe Crivellaro Minuzzi, Leandro Farina</p>
<p>Abstract: The forecast of wave variables are important for several applications that depend on a better description of the ocean state. Due to the chaotic behaviour of the differential equations which model this problem, a well know strategy to overcome the difficulties is basically to run several simulations, by for instance, varying the initial condition, and averaging the result of each of these, creating an ensemble. Moreover, in the last few years, considering the amount of available data and the computational power increase, machine learning algorithms have been applied as surrogate to traditional numerical models, yielding comparative or better results. In this work, we present a methodology to create an ensemble of different artificial neural networks architectures, namely, MLP, RNN, LSTM, CNN and a hybrid CNN-LSTM, which aims to predict significant wave height on six different locations in the Brazilian coast. The networks are trained using NOAA's numerical reforecast data and target the residual between observational data and the numerical model output. A new strategy to create the training and target datasets is demonstrated. Results show that our framework is capable of producing high efficient forecast, with an average accuracy of $80\%$, that can achieve up to $88\%$ in the best case scenario, which means $5\%$ reduction in error metrics if compared to NOAA's numerical model, and a increasingly reduction of computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiun-Cheng Jiang, Morris Yu-Chao Huang, Tianlong Chen, Hsi-Sheng Goan</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are central to quantum machine learning, while recent progress in Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) highlights the power of learnable activation functions. We unify these directions by introducing quantum variational activation functions (QVAFs), realized through single-qubit data re-uploading circuits called DatA Re-Uploading ActivatioNs (DARUANs). We show that DARUAN with trainable weights in data pre-processing possesses an exponentially growing frequency spectrum with data repetitions, enabling an exponential reduction in parameter size compared with Fourier-based activations without loss of expressivity. Embedding DARUAN into KANs yields quantum-inspired KANs (QKANs), which retain the interpretability of KANs while improving their parameter efficiency, expressivity, and generalization. We further introduce two novel techniques to enhance scalability, feasibility and computational efficiency, such as layer extension and hybrid QKANs (HQKANs) as drop-in replacements of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for feed-forward networks in large-scale models. We provide theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on function regression, image classification, and autoregressive generative language modeling, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of QKANs. DARUANs and QKANs offer a promising direction for advancing quantum machine learning on both noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and classical quantum simulators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Achieving human-level translations requires leveraging context to ensure coherence and handle complex phenomena like pronoun disambiguation. Sparsity of contextually rich examples in the standard training data has been hypothesized as the reason for the difficulty of context utilization. In this work, we systematically validate this claim in both single- and multilingual settings by constructing training datasets with a controlled proportions of contextually relevant examples. We demonstrate a strong association between training data sparsity and model performance confirming sparsity as a key bottleneck. Importantly, we reveal that improvements in one contextual phenomenon do no generalize to others. While we observe some cross-lingual transfer, it is not significantly higher between languages within the same sub-family. Finally, we propose and empirically evaluate two training strategies designed to leverage the available data. These strategies improve context utilization, resulting in accuracy gains of up to 6 and 8 percentage points on the ctxPro evaluation in single- and multilingual settings respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the existence and computation of Nash equilibria in continuous static games where the players' admissible strategies are subject to shared coupling constraints, i.e., constraints that depend on their \emph{joint} strategies. Specifically, we focus on a class of games characterized by playerwise concave utilities and playerwise concave constraints. Prior results on the existence of Nash equilibria are not applicable to this class, as they rely on strong assumptions such as joint convexity of the feasible set. By leveraging topological fixed point theory and novel structural insights into the contractibility of feasible sets under playerwise concave constraints, we give an existence proof for Nash equilibria under weaker conditions. Having established existence, we then focus on the computation of Nash equilibria via independent gradient methods under the additional assumption that the utilities admit a potential function. To account for the possibly nonconvex feasible region, we employ a log barrier regularized gradient ascent with adaptive stepsizes. Starting from an initial feasible strategy profile and under exact gradient feedback, the proposed method converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate constrained Nash equilibrium within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding disease similarity is critical for advancing diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized treatment strategies. We present PhenoGnet, a novel graph-based contrastive learning framework designed to predict disease similarity by integrating gene functional interaction networks with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). PhenoGnet comprises two key components: an intra-view model that separately encodes gene and phenotype graphs using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and a cross view model implemented as a shared weight multilayer perceptron (MLP) that aligns gene and phenotype embeddings through contrastive learning. The model is trained using known gene phenotype associations as positive pairs and randomly sampled unrelated pairs as negatives. Diseases are represented by the mean embeddings of their associated genes and/or phenotypes, and pairwise similarity is computed via cosine similarity. Evaluation on a curated benchmark of 1,100 similar and 866 dissimilar disease pairs demonstrates strong performance, with gene based embeddings achieving an AUCPR of 0.9012 and AUROC of 0.8764, outperforming existing state of the art methods. Notably, PhenoGnet captures latent biological relationships beyond direct overlap, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for disease similarity prediction. These results underscore its potential for enabling downstream applications in rare disease research and precision medicine.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inferring parameters of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) poses significant computational and inferential challenges, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality and the inherent limitations of traditional numerical methods. This paper introduces a novel two-stage Bayesian framework that synergistically integrates training, physics-based deep kernel learning (DKL) with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to robustly infer unknown PDE parameters and quantify their uncertainties from sparse, exact observations. The first stage leverages physics-based DKL to train a surrogate model, which jointly yields an optimized neural network feature extractor and robust initial estimates for the PDE parameters. In the second stage, with the neural network weights fixed, HMC is employed within a full Bayesian framework to efficiently sample the joint posterior distribution of the kernel hyperparameters and the PDE parameters. Numerical experiments on canonical and high-dimensional inverse PDE problems demonstrate that our framework accurately estimates parameters, provides reliable uncertainty estimates, and effectively addresses challenges of data sparsity and model complexity, offering a robust and scalable tool for diverse scientific and engineering applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Sheng Chen, En-Jui Kuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models typically employ static or heuristic classifier-free guidance (CFG) schedules, which often fail to adapt across timesteps and noise conditions. In this work, we introduce a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) controller that dynamically adjusts CFG at each denoising step. The controller adopts a hybrid quantum--classical actor--critic architecture: a shallow variational quantum circuit (VQC) with ring entanglement generates policy features, which are mapped by a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP) into Gaussian actions over $\Delta$CFG, while a classical critic estimates value functions. The policy is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), guided by a reward that balances classification confidence, perceptual improvement, and action regularization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our QRL policy improves perceptual quality (LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM) while reducing parameter count compared to classical RL actors and fixed schedules. Ablation studies on qubit number and circuit depth reveal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, and extended evaluations confirm robust generation under long diffusion schedules.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personalized financial advice requires consideration of user goals, constraints, risk tolerance, and jurisdiction. Prior LLM work has focused on support systems for investors and financial planners. Simultaneously, numerous recent studies examine broader personal finance tasks, including budgeting, debt management, retirement, and estate planning, through agentic pipelines that incur high maintenance costs, yielding less than 25% of their expected financial returns. In this study, we introduce a novel and reproducible framework that integrates relevant financial context with behavioral finance studies to construct supervision data for end-to-end advisors. Using this framework, we create a 19k sample reasoning dataset and conduct a comprehensive fine-tuning of the Qwen-3-8B model on the dataset. Through a held-out test split and a blind LLM-jury study, we demonstrate that through careful data curation and behavioral integration, our 8B model achieves performance comparable to significantly larger baselines (14-32B parameters) across factual accuracy, fluency, and personalization metrics while incurring 80% lower costs than the larger counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shalima Binta Manir, Tim Oates</p>
<p>Abstract: Mental representation, characterized by structured internal models mirroring external environments, is fundamental to advanced cognition but remains challenging to investigate empirically. Existing theory hypothesizes that second-order learning -- learning mechanisms that adapt first-order learning (i.e., learning about the task/domain) -- promotes the emergence of such environment-cognition isomorphism. In this paper, we empirically validate this hypothesis by proposing a hierarchical architecture comprising a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) as a first-order learner and an MLP controller as a second-order learner. The GCN directly maps node-level features to predictions of optimal navigation paths, while the MLP dynamically adapts the GCN's parameters when confronting structurally novel maze environments. We demonstrate that second-order learning is particularly effective when the cognitive system develops an internal mental map structurally isomorphic to the environment. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight significant performance improvements and robust generalization on unseen maze tasks, providing empirical support for the pivotal role of structured mental representations in maximizing the effectiveness of second-order learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haichao Zhang, Wenhao Chai, Shwai He, Ang Li, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2) Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics. Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengbo Wang, Nian Si</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning and optimal control under robust Markov decision processes (MDPs) have received increasing attention, yet most existing theory, algorithms, and applications focus on finite-horizon or discounted models. The average-reward formulation, while natural in many operations research and management contexts, remains underexplored. This is primarily because the dynamic programming foundations are technically challenging and only partially understood, with several fundamental questions remaining open. This paper steps toward a general framework for average-reward robust MDPs by analyzing the constant-gain setting. We study the average-reward robust control problem with possible information asymmetries between the controller and an S-rectangular adversary. Our analysis centers on the constant-gain robust Bellman equation, examining both the existence of solutions and their relationship to the optimal average reward. Specifically, we identify when solutions to the robust Bellman equation characterize the optimal average reward and stationary policies, and we provide sufficient conditions ensuring solutions' existence. These findings expand the dynamic programming theory for average-reward robust MDPs and lay a foundation for robust dynamic decision making under long-run average criteria in operational environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Shaffer, Victoria Edwards, Brooks Kinch, Nathaniel Trask, M. Ani Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: Source localization in a complex flow poses a significant challenge for multi-robot teams tasked with localizing the source of chemical leaks or tracking the dispersion of an oil spill. The flow dynamics can be time-varying and chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and complex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model and predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes that drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally intensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is limited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source localization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element model of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are used to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an infotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to maximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach achieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and results in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine learning approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rieko Tasaka, Tatsuya Kimura, Joe Suzuki</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the unresolved problem of selecting the regularization parameter in the fused lasso. In particular, we extend the framework of the Spacing Test proposed by Tibshirani et al. to the fused lasso, providing a theoretical foundation for post-selection inference by characterizing the selection event as a polyhedral constraint. Based on the analysis of the solution path of the fused lasso using a LARS-type algorithm, we derive exact conditional $p$-values for the selected change-points. Our method broadens the applicability of the Spacing Test from the standard lasso to fused penalty structures. Furthermore, through numerical experiments comparing the proposed method with sequential versions of AIC and BIC as well as cross-validation, we demonstrate that the proposed approach properly controls the type I error while achieving high detection power. This work offers a theoretically sound and computationally practical solution for parameter selection and post-selection inference in structured signal estimation problems.

<p>Abstract: We present Apertus, a fully open suite of large language models (LLMs) designed to address two systemic shortcomings in today's open model ecosystem: data compliance and multilingual representation. Unlike many prior models that release weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner rights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data, retroactively respecting robots.txt exclusions and filtering for non-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks of memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly suppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task performance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on 15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to non-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches state-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks, rivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we release all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive license, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites, and training code, enabling transparent audit and extension.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Simchi-Levi, Yunzong Xu, Jinglong Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the impact of limited switches on resource-constrained dynamic pricing with demand learning. We focus on the classical price-based blind network revenue management problem and extend our results to the bandits with knapsacks problem. In both settings, a decision maker faces stochastic and distributionally unknown demand, and must allocate finite initial inventory across multiple resources over time. In addition to standard resource constraints, we impose a switching constraint that limits the number of action changes over the time horizon. We establish matching upper and lower bounds on the optimal regret and develop computationally efficient limited-switch algorithms that achieve it. We show that the optimal regret rate is fully characterized by a piecewise-constant function of the switching budget, which further depends on the number of resource constraints. Our results highlight the fundamental role of resource constraints in shaping the statistical complexity of online learning under limited switches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithms maintain strong cumulative reward performance while significantly reducing the number of switches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Souveton, Arnaud Guillin, Jens Jasche, Guilhem Lavaux, Manon Michel</p>
<p>Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NF) are Generative models which transform a simple prior distribution into the desired target. They however require the design of an invertible mapping whose Jacobian determinant has to be computable. Recently introduced, Neural Hamiltonian Flows (NHF) are Hamiltonian dynamics-based flows, which are continuous, volume-preserving and invertible and thus make for natural candidates for robust NF architectures. In particular, their similarity to classical Mechanics could lead to easier interpretability of the learned mapping. In this paper, we show that the current NHF architecture may still pose a challenge to interpretability. Inspired by Physics, we introduce a fixed-kinetic energy version of the model. This approach improves interpretability and robustness while requiring fewer parameters than the original model. We illustrate that on a 2D Gaussian mixture and on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Finally, we show how to adapt NHF to the context of Bayesian inference and illustrate the method on an example from cosmology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Seber</p>
<p>Abstract: O-GlcNAcylation, a subtype of glycosylation, has the potential to be an important target for therapeutics, but methods to reliably predict O-GlcNAcylation sites had not been available until 2023; a 2021 review correctly noted that published models were insufficient and failed to generalize. Moreover, many are no longer usable. In 2023, a considerably better recurrent neural network (RNN) model was published. This article creates improved models by using a new loss function, which we call the weighted focal differentiable MCC. RNN models trained with this new loss display superior performance to models trained using the weighted cross-entropy loss; this new function can also be used to fine-tune trained models. An RNN trained with this loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in O-GlcNAcylation site prediction with an F$_1$ score of 38.88% and an MCC of 38.20% on an independent test set from the largest dataset available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niklas Grieger, Siamak Mehrkanoon, Stephan Bialonski</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) time series can be challenging, especially with deep neural networks, due to the large variability among human subjects and often small datasets. To address these challenges, various strategies, such as self-supervised learning, have been suggested, but they typically rely on extensive empirical datasets. Inspired by recent advances in computer vision, we propose a pretraining task termed "frequency pretraining" to pretrain a neural network for sleep staging by predicting the frequency content of randomly generated synthetic time series. Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses fully supervised learning in scenarios with limited data and few subjects, and matches its performance in regimes with many subjects. Furthermore, our results underline the relevance of frequency information for sleep stage scoring, while also demonstrating that deep neural networks utilize information beyond frequencies to enhance sleep staging performance, which is consistent with previous research. We anticipate that our approach will be advantageous across a broad spectrum of applications where EEG data is limited or derived from a small number of subjects, including the domain of brain-computer interfaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghao Huang, Xiaolu Chen, Yanru Zhang, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterogeneity arising from label distribution skew and data scarcity can cause inaccuracy and unfairness in intelligent communication applications that heavily rely on distributed computing. To deal with it, this paper proposes a novel personalized federated learning algorithm, named Federated Contrastive Shareable Representations (FedCoSR), to facilitate knowledge sharing among clients while maintaining data privacy. Specifically, the parameters of local models' shallow layers and typical local representations are both considered as shareable information for the server and are aggregated globally. To address performance degradation caused by label distribution skew among clients, contrastive learning is adopted between local and global representations to enrich local knowledge. Additionally, to ensure fairness for clients with scarce data, FedCoSR introduces adaptive local aggregation to coordinate the global model involvement in each client. Our simulations demonstrate FedCoSR's effectiveness in mitigating label heterogeneity by achieving accuracy and fairness improvements over existing methods on datasets with varying degrees of label heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiexia Ye, Yongzi Yu, Weiqi Zhang, Le Wang, Jia Li, Fugee Tsung</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series data are ubiquitous across diverse real-world applications, making time series analysis critically important. Traditional approaches are largely task-specific, offering limited functionality and poor transferability. In recent years, foundation models have revolutionized NLP and CV with their remarkable cross-task transferability, zero-/few-shot learning capabilities, and multimodal integration capacity. This success has motivated increasing efforts to explore foundation models for addressing time series modeling challenges. Although some tutorials and surveys were published in the early stages of this field, the rapid pace of recent developments necessitates a more comprehensive and in-depth synthesis to cover the latest advances. Our survey aims to fill this gap by introducing a modality-aware, challenge-oriented perspective, which reveals how foundation models pre-trained on different modalities face distinct hurdles when adapted to time series tasks. Building on this perspective, we propose a taxonomy of existing works organized by pre-training modality (time series, language, and vision), analyze modality-specific challenges and categorize corresponding solutions, discussing their advantages and limitations. Beyond this, we review real-world applications to illustrate domain-specific advancements, provide open-source codes, and conclude with potential future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to train generative models that produce realistic, safe and useful tabular data is essential for data privacy, imputation, oversampling, explainability or simulation. However, generating tabular data is not straightforward due to its heterogeneity, non-smooth distributions, complex dependencies and imbalanced categorical features. Although diverse methods have been proposed in the literature, there is a need for a unified evaluation, under the same conditions, on a variety of datasets. This study addresses this need by fully considering the optimization of: hyperparameters, feature encodings, and architectures. We investigate the impact of dataset-specific tuning on five recent model families for tabular data generation through an extensive benchmark on 16 datasets. These datasets vary in terms of size (an average of 80,000 rows), data types, and domains. We also propose a reduced search space for each model that allows for quick optimization, achieving nearly equivalent performance at a significantly lower cost. Our benchmark demonstrates that, for most models, large-scale dataset-specific tuning substantially improves performance compared to the original configurations. Furthermore, we confirm that diffusion-based models generally outperform other models on tabular data. However, this advantage is not significant when the entire tuning and training process is restricted to the same GPU budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative for solving partial differential equations. However, for complex problems, training these networks can still be challenging, often resulting in unsatisfactory accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that the failure of plain physics-informed neural networks arises from the significant discrepancy in the convergence rate of residuals at different training points, where the slowest convergence rate dominates the overall solution convergence. Based on these observations, we propose a pointwise adaptive weighting method that balances the residual decay rate across different training points. The performance of our proposed adaptive weighting method is compared with current state-of-the-art adaptive weighting methods on benchmark problems for both physics-informed neural networks and physics-informed deep operator networks. Through extensive numerical results we demonstrate that our proposed approach of balanced residual decay rates offers several advantages, including bounded weights, high prediction accuracy, fast convergence rate, low training uncertainty, low computational cost, and ease of hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore multiple instance verification, a problem setting in which a query instance is verified against a bag of target instances with heterogeneous, unknown relevancy. We show that naive adaptations of attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods and standard verification methods like Siamese neural networks are unsuitable for this setting: directly combining state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods and Siamese networks is shown to be no better, and sometimes significantly worse, than a simple baseline model. Postulating that this may be caused by the failure of the representation of the target bag to incorporate the query instance, we introduce a new pooling approach named "cross-attention pooling" (CAP). Under the CAP framework, we propose two novel attention functions to address the challenge of distinguishing between highly similar instances in a target bag. Through empirical studies on three different verification tasks, we demonstrate that CAP outperforms adaptations of SOTA MIL methods and the baseline by substantial margins, in terms of both classification accuracy and the ability to detect key instances. The superior ability to identify key instances is attributed to the new attention functions by ablation studies. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphs offer unique insights into relationships between entities, complementing data modalities like text and images and enabling AI models to extend their capabilities beyond traditional tasks. However, learning from graphs often involves handling sensitive relationships in the data, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing privacy-preserving methods, such as DP-SGD, rely on gradient decoupling assumptions and are incompatible with relational learning due to the inherent dependencies between training samples. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving pipeline for relational learning that decouples dependencies in sampled relations for training, ensuring differential privacy through a tailored application of DP-SGD. We apply this approach to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), such as Llama2, on sensitive graph data while addressing the associated computational complexities. Our method is evaluated on four real-world text-attributed graphs, demonstrating significant improvements in relational learning tasks while maintaining robust privacy guarantees. Additionally, we analyze the trade-offs between privacy, utility, and computational efficiency, offering insights into the practical deployment of our approach for privacy-preserving relational learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjoon Lee, Jinu Gong, Joonhyuk Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Given sufficient data from multiple edge devices, federated learning (FL) enables training a shared model without transmitting private data to the central server. However, FL is generally vulnerable to Byzantine attacks from compromised edge devices, which can significantly degrade the model performance. In this work, we propose an intuitive plugin that seamlessly embeds Byzantine resilience into existing FL methods. The key idea is to generate virtual data samples and evaluate model consistency scores across local updates to effectively filter out compromised updates. By utilizing this scoring mechanism before the aggregation phase, the proposed plugin enables existing FL methods to become robust against Byzantine attacks while maintaining their original benefits. Numerical results on blood cell classification task demonstrate that the proposed plugin provides strong Byzantine resilience. In detail, plugin-attached FedAvg achieves over 89.6% test accuracy under 30% targeted attacks (vs.19.5% w/o plugin) and maintains 65-70% test accuracy under untargeted attacks (vs.17-19% w/o plugin).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erin Carson, Xinye Chen, Cheng Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), a trajectory modelling method, has shown competitive performance compared to traditional offline reinforcement learning (RL) approaches on various classic control tasks. However, it struggles to learn optimal policies from suboptimal, reward-labelled trajectories. In this study, we explore the use of conditional generative modelling to facilitate trajectory stitching given its high-quality data generation ability. Additionally, recent advancements in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown their linear complexity and competitive sequence modelling performance over Transformers. We leverage the Test-Time Training (TTT) layer, an RNN that updates hidden states during testing, to model trajectories in the form of DT. We introduce a unified framework, called Diffusion-Refined Decision TTT (DRDT3), to achieve performance beyond DT models. Specifically, we propose the Decision TTT (DT3) module, which harnesses the sequence modelling strengths of both self-attention and the TTT layer to capture recent contextual information and make coarse action predictions. DRDT3 iteratively refines the coarse action predictions through the generative diffusion model, progressively moving closer to the optimal actions. We further integrate DT3 with the diffusion model using a unified optimization objective. With experiments on multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark, our DT3 model without diffusion refinement demonstrates improved performance over standard DT, while DRDT3 further achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art DT-based and offline RL methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Qi, Fei Guo, Li Zhu, Qiaosheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with graph feedback. Motivated by applications in clinical trials and recommendation systems, we assume that two arms are connected if and only if they are similar (i.e., their means are close to each other). We establish a regret lower bound for this problem under the novel feedback structure and introduce two upper confidence bound (UCB)-based algorithms: Double-UCB, which has problem-independent regret upper bounds, and Conservative-UCB, which has problem-dependent upper bounds. Leveraging the similarity structure, we also explore a scenario where the number of arms increases over time (referred to as the \emph{ballooning setting}). Practical applications of this scenario include Q\&A platforms (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow, Quora) and product reviews on platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, where answers (or reviews) continuously appear, and the goal is to display the best ones at the top. We extend these two UCB-based algorithms to the ballooning setting. Under mild assumptions, we provide regret upper bounds for both algorithms and discuss their sub-linearity. Furthermore, we propose a new version of the corresponding algorithms that do not rely on prior knowledge of the graph's structural information and provide regret upper bounds. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the theoretical results.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we experiment with novelty-based variants of OpenAI-ES, the NS-ES and NSR-ES algorithms, and evaluate their effectiveness in training complex, transformer-based architectures designed for the problem of reinforcement learning, such as Decision Transformers. We also test if we can accelerate the novelty-based training of these larger models by seeding the training with a pretrained models. The experimental results were mixed. NS-ES showed progress, but it would clearly need many more iterations for it to yield interesting agents. NSR-ES, on the other hand, proved quite capable of being straightforwardly used on larger models, since its performance appears as similar between the feed-forward model and Decision Transformer, as it was for the OpenAI-ES in our previous work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaling laws are typically fit using a family of models with a narrow range of frozen hyper-parameter choices. In this work we study scaling laws using multiple architectural shapes and hyperparameter choices, highlighting their impact on resulting prescriptions. As a primary artifact of our research, we release the Gemstones: an open-source scaling law dataset, consisting of over 4000 checkpoints from transformers with up to 2 billion parameters and diverse architectural shapes; including ablations over learning rate and cooldown. Our checkpoints enable more complex studies of scaling, such as analyzing the relationship between width and depth. By examining our model suite, we find that the prescriptions of scaling laws can be highly sensitive to the experimental design process and the specific model checkpoints used during fitting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junrui Wen, Yifei Li, Bart Selman, Kun He</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural solvers have shown significant potential in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), yet current approaches face significant challenges. Supervised learning (SL)-based solvers require large amounts of high-quality labeled data, while reinforcement learning (RL)-based solvers, though less dependent on such data, often suffer from inefficiencies. To address these limitations, we propose LocalEscaper, a novel weakly-supervised learning framework for large-scale TSP. LocalEscaper effectively combines the advantages of both SL and RL, enabling effective training on datasets with low-quality labels. To further enhance solution quality, we introduce a regional reconstruction strategy, which is the key technique of this paper and mitigates the local-optima problem common in existing local reconstruction methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LocalEscaper outperforms existing neural solvers, achieving remarkable results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) is important for aligning outputs with diverse user preferences, yet existing methods struggle with flexibility and generalization. We propose CoPL (Collaborative Preference Learning), a graph-based collaborative filtering framework that models user-response relationships to enhance preference estimation, particularly in sparse annotation settings. By integrating a mixture of LoRA experts, CoPL efficiently fine-tunes LLMs while dynamically balancing shared and user-specific preferences. Additionally, an optimization-free adaptation strategy enables generalization to unseen users without fine-tuning. Experiments on UltraFeedback-P demonstrate that CoPL outperforms existing personalized reward models, effectively capturing both common and controversial preferences, making it a scalable solution for personalized LLM alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niklas Penzel, Joachim Denzler</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models achieve high predictive performance but lack intrinsic interpretability, hindering our understanding of the learned prediction behavior. Existing local explainability methods focus on associations, neglecting the causal drivers of model predictions. Other approaches adopt a causal perspective but primarily provide global, model-level explanations. However, for specific inputs, it's unclear whether globally identified factors apply locally. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework for local interventional explanations by leveraging recent advances in image-to-image editing models. Our approach performs gradual interventions on semantic properties to quantify the corresponding impact on a model's predictions using a novel score, the expected property gradient magnitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an extensive empirical evaluation on a wide range of architectures and tasks. First, we validate it in a synthetic scenario and demonstrate its ability to locally identify biases. Afterward, we apply our approach to investigate medical skin lesion classifiers, analyze network training dynamics, and study a pre-trained CLIP model with real-life interventional data. Our results highlight the potential of interventional explanations on the property level to reveal new insights into the behavior of deep models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Shaki, Emanuele La Malfa, Michael Wooldridge, Sarit Kraus</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) reason about memorized knowledge through simple binary relations such as equality ($=$), inequality ($<$), and inclusion ($\subset$). Unlike in-context reasoning, the axioms (e.g., $a < b, b < c$) are only seen during training and not provided in the task prompt (e.g., evaluating $a < c$). The tasks require one or more reasoning steps, and data aggregation from one or more sources, showing performance change with task complexity. We introduce a lightweight technique, out-of-context representation learning, which trains only new token embeddings on axioms and evaluates them on unseen tasks. Across reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity tests, LLMs mostly perform statistically significant better than chance, making the correct answer extractable when testing multiple phrasing variations, but still fall short of consistent reasoning on every single query. Analysis shows that the learned embeddings are organized in structured ways, suggesting real relational understanding. Surprisingly, it also indicates that the core reasoning happens during the training, not inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Abbasishahkoo, Mahboubeh Dadkhah, Lionel Briand, Dayi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face challenges during deployment due to covariate shift, i.e., data distribution shifts between development and deployment contexts. Fine-tuning adapts pre-trained models to new contexts requiring smaller labeled sets. However, testing fine-tuned models under constrained labeling budgets remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces MetaSel, a new approach tailored for DNN models that have been fine-tuned to address covariate shift, to select tests from unlabeled inputs. MetaSel assumes that fine-tuned and pre-trained models share related data distributions and exhibit similar behaviors for many inputs. However, their behaviors diverge within the input subspace where fine-tuning alters decision boundaries, making those inputs more prone to misclassification. Unlike general approaches that rely solely on the DNN model and its input set, MetaSel leverages information from both the fine-tuned and pre-trained models and their behavioral differences to estimate misclassification probability for unlabeled test inputs, enabling more effective test selection. Our extensive empirical evaluation, comparing MetaSel against 11 state-of-the-art approaches and involving 68 fine-tuned models across weak, medium, and strong distribution shifts, demonstrates that MetaSel consistently delivers significant improvements in Test Relative Coverage (TRC) over existing baselines, particularly under highly constrained labeling budgets. MetaSel shows average TRC improvements of 28.46% to 56.18% over the most frequent second-best baselines while maintaining a high TRC median and low variability. Our results confirm MetaSel's practicality, robustness, and cost-effectiveness for test selection in the context of fine-tuned models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gergely D. N\'emeth, Eros Fan\`i, Yeat Jeng Ng, Barbara Caputo, Miguel \'Angel Lozano, Nuria Oliver, Novi Quadrianto</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning models on distributed data while preserving privacy. However, in real-world FL settings, client data is often non-identically distributed and imbalanced, resulting in statistical data heterogeneity which impacts the generalization capabilities of the server's model across clients, slows convergence and reduces performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing first a characterization of statistical data heterogeneity by means of 6 metrics of global and client attribute imbalance, class imbalance, and spurious correlations. Next, we create and share 7 computer vision datasets for binary and multiclass image classification tasks in Federated Learning that cover a broad range of statistical data heterogeneity and hence simulate real-world situations. Finally, we propose FEDDIVERSE, a novel client selection algorithm in FL which is designed to manage and leverage data heterogeneity across clients by promoting collaboration between clients with complementary data distributions. Experiments on the seven proposed FL datasets demonstrate FEDDIVERSE's effectiveness in enhancing the performance and robustness of a variety of FL methods while having low communication and computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Naganuma, Xinzhi Zhang, Man-Chung Yue, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Philipp A. Witte, Russell J. Hewett, Yin Tat Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Following AI scaling trends, frontier models continue to grow in size and continue to be trained on larger datasets. Training these models requires huge investments in exascale computational resources, which has in turn driven developtment of distributed deep learning methods. Data parallelism is an essential approach to speed up training, but it requires frequent global communication between workers, which can bottleneck training at the largest scales. In this work, we propose a method called Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD (PALSGD) to improve the efficiency of data-parallel training. PALSGD is an extension of Local SGD (Stich, 2018) and DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023), designed to further reduce communication frequency by introducing a pseudo-synchronization mechanism. PALSGD allows the use of longer synchronization intervals compared to standard Local SGD. Despite the reduced communication frequency, the pseudo-synchronization approach ensures that model consistency is maintained, leading to performance results comparable to those achieved with more frequent synchronization. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of PALSGD, establishing its convergence and deriving its convergence rate. This analysis offers insights into the algorithm's behavior and performance guarantees. We evaluated PALSGD on image classification and language modeling tasks. Our results show that PALSGD achieves better performance in less time compared to existing methods like Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and DiLoCo. Notably, PALSGD trains 18.4% faster than DDP on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, 24.4% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-125M, and 21.1% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-8M.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across decentralized devices without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy in sensitive domains like healthcare. In this paper, we evaluate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) architectures against traditional MLP across six state-of-the-art FL algorithms on a blood cell classification dataset. Notably, our experiments demonstrate that KAN can effectively replace MLP in federated environments, achieving superior performance with simpler architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key hyperparameters-grid size and network architecture-on KAN performance under varying degrees of Non-IID data distribution. In addition, our ablation studies reveal that optimizing KAN width while maintaining minimal depth yields the best performance in federated settings. As a result, these findings establish KAN as a promising alternative for privacy-preserving medical imaging applications in distributed healthcare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark of KAN in FL settings for medical imaging task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca Fabiani, Hannes Vandecasteele, Somdatta Goswami, Constantinos Siettos, Ioannis G. Kevrekidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a $\textit{non-linear}$ recurrent model that processes long sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the Jacobian matrix to be diagonal, the full sequence can be solved in parallel, giving $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover, LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Importantly, the diagonal Jacobian structure of our model results in no performance loss compared to the original model with dense Jacobian, and the approach can be generalized to other non-linear recurrent models, demonstrating broader applicability. On a suite of long-range forecasting tasks, we demonstrate that LrcSSM outperforms Transformers, LRU, S5, and Mamba.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses, and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data. Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy graph.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adolfo Gonz\'alez, V\'ictor Parada</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for effective inventory management in dynamic and competitive environments, where decisions are influenced by uncertainty, financial constraints, and logistical limitations. Traditional evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) provide complementary perspectives but may lead to biased assessments when applied individually. To address this limitation, we propose the Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF), a composite function that integrates R2, MAE, and RMSE within a hierarchical and adaptive framework. The function incorporates dynamic weights, tolerance thresholds derived from the statistical properties of the series, and progressive penalty mechanisms to ensure robustness against extreme errors and invalid predictions. HEF was implemented to optimize multiple forecasting models using Grid Search, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Optuna, and tested on benchmark datasets including Walmart, M3, M4, and M5. Experimental results, validated through statistical tests, demonstrate that HEF consistently outperforms MAE as an evaluation function in global metrics such as R2, Global Relative Accuracy (GRA), RMSE, and RMSSE, thereby providing greater explanatory power, adaptability, and stability. While MAE retains advantages in simplicity and efficiency, HEF proves more effective for long-term planning and complex contexts. Overall, HEF constitutes a robust and adaptive alternative for model selection and hyperparameter optimization in highly variable demand forecasting environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a tiled-block strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework. This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to process long contexts without any pre-processing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the standard TabArena benchmark, with code available at https://github.com/mrsergazinov/chunk_tabpfn.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Rong Wang, Thomas C. Henderson, Yew Soon Ong, Yih Yng Ng, Xiuyi Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals (PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach, based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling, representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign forecasts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient management. In this work, we present ModaliSurv, a multimodal deep survival model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks. For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting, our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving heterogeneous biomedical data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Morteza Rezaalipour, Francesco Costa, Marco Biasion, Rodrigo Otoni, George A. Constantinides, Laura Pozzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks - i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area. We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yajun Yu, Steve Jiang, Robert Timmerman, Hao Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR) is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals. Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features. Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error (RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics, dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models. Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and treatment adjustment in PULSAR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delio Jaramillo-Velez, Charul Rajput, Ragnar Freij-Hollanti, Camilla Hollanti, Alexandre Graell i Amat</p>
<p>Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models, secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem, but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Au Yeung, Jacopo Dalmasso, Luca Foschini, Richard JB Dobson, Zeljko Kraljevic</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Emerging reports of "AI psychosis" are on the rise, where user-LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis or adverse psychological symptoms. Whilst the sycophantic and agreeable nature of LLMs can be beneficial, it becomes a vector for harm by reinforcing delusional beliefs in vulnerable users.
  Methods: Psychosis-bench is a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the psychogenicity of LLMs comprises 16 structured, 12-turn conversational scenarios simulating the progression of delusional themes(Erotic Delusions, Grandiose/Messianic Delusions, Referential Delusions) and potential harms. We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion Confirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across explicit and implicit conversational contexts.
  Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated psychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than challenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled harmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\pm$0.84) and offered safety interventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37 $\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered. Performance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more likely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions (p < .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77). Model performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent property of scale alone.
  Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk and underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame this issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health imperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Crimi, Andrea Brovelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work, we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55 in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility, strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal discovery in time-series data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiadong Hong, Lei Liu, Xinyu Bian, Wenjie Wang, Zhaoyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudio Battiloro, Andrea Cavallo, Elvin Isufi</p>
<p>Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs) as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13211">HAM: Hierarchical Adapter Merging for Scalable Continual Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Nuertey Coleman, Luigi Quarantiello, Samrat Mukherjee, Julio Hurtado, Vincenzo Lomonaco</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information, causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge, facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhizhong Zhao, Ke Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs) on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities. Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ methods while incurring minimal overhead.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Namiko Saito, Mayu Tatsumi, Ayuna Kubo, Kanata Suzuki, Hiroshi Ito, Shigeki Sugano, Tetsuya Ogata</p>
<p>Abstract: To support humans in their daily lives, robots are required to autonomously learn, adapt to objects and environments, and perform the appropriate actions. We tackled on the task of cooking scrambled eggs using real ingredients, in which the robot needs to perceive the states of the egg and adjust stirring movement in real time, while the egg is heated and the state changes continuously. In previous works, handling changing objects was found to be challenging because sensory information includes dynamical, both important or noisy information, and the modality which should be focused on changes every time, making it difficult to realize both perception and motion generation in real time. We propose a predictive recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism that can weigh the sensor input, distinguishing how important and reliable each modality is, that realize quick and efficient perception and motion generation. The model is trained with learning from the demonstration, and allows the robot to acquire human-like skills. We validated the proposed technique using the robot, Dry-AIREC, and with our learning model, it could perform cooking eggs with unknown ingredients. The robot could change the method of stirring and direction depending on the status of the egg, as in the beginning it stirs in the whole pot, then subsequently, after the egg started being heated, it starts flipping and splitting motion targeting specific areas, although we did not explicitly indicate them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bart Pleiter, Behrad Tajalli, Stefanos Koffas, Gorka Abad, Jing Xu, Martha Larson, Stjepan Picek</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown great promise in various domains. However, vulnerabilities associated with DNN training, such as backdoor attacks, are a significant concern. These attacks involve the subtle insertion of triggers during model training, allowing for manipulated predictions. More recently, DNNs used with tabular data have gained increasing attention due to the rise of transformer models. Our research presents a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on tabular data using DNNs, mainly focusing on transformers. We propose a novel approach for trigger construction: in-bounds attack, which provides excellent attack performance while maintaining stealthiness. Through systematic experimentation across benchmark datasets, we uncover that transformer-based DNNs for tabular data are highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, even with minimal feature value alterations. We also verify that these attacks can be generalized to other models, like XGBoost and DeepFM. Our results demonstrate up to 100% attack success rate with negligible clean accuracy drop. Furthermore, we evaluate several defenses against these attacks, identifying Spectral Signatures as the most effective. Still, our findings highlight the need to develop tabular data-specific countermeasures to defend against backdoor attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuu Jinnai, Ukyo Honda</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference optimization is a standard approach to fine-tuning large language models to align with human preferences. The quantity, diversity, and representativeness of the preference dataset are critical to the effectiveness of preference optimization. However, obtaining a large amount of preference annotations is difficult in many applications. This raises the question of how to use the limited annotation budget to create an effective preference dataset. To this end, we propose Annotation-Efficient Preference Optimization (AEPO). Instead of exhaustively annotating preference over all available response texts, AEPO selects a subset of responses that maximizes diversity and representativeness from the available responses and then annotates preference over the selected ones. In this way, AEPO focuses the annotation budget on labeling preferences over a smaller but informative subset of responses. We evaluate the performance of preference learning using AEPO on three datasets and show that it outperforms the baselines with the same annotation budget.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabio Feser, Marina Evangelou</p>
<p>Abstract: The sparse-group lasso performs both variable and group selection, simultaneously using the strengths of the lasso and group lasso. It has found widespread use in genetics, a field that regularly involves the analysis of high-dimensional data, due to its sparse-group penalty, which allows it to utilize grouping information. However, the sparse-group lasso can be computationally expensive, due to the added shrinkage complexity, and its additional hyperparameter that needs tuning. This paper presents a novel feature reduction method, Dual Feature Reduction (DFR), that uses strong screening rules for the sparse-group lasso and the adaptive sparse-group lasso to reduce their input space before optimization, without affecting solution optimality. DFR applies two layers of screening through the application of dual norms and subdifferentials. Through synthetic and real data studies, it is shown that DFR drastically reduces the computational cost under many different scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural language is often the easiest and most convenient modality for humans to specify tasks for robots. However, learning to ground language to behavior typically requires impractical amounts of diverse, language-annotated demonstrations collected on each target robot. In this work, we aim to separate the problem of what to accomplish from how to accomplish it, as the former can benefit from substantial amounts of external observation-only data, and only the latter depends on a specific robot embodiment. To this end, we propose Video-Language Critic, a reward model that can be trained on readily available cross-embodiment data using contrastive learning and a temporal ranking objective, and use it to score behavior traces from a separate actor. When trained on Open X-Embodiment data, our reward model enables 2x more sample-efficient policy training on Meta-World tasks than a sparse reward only, despite a significant domain gap. Using in-domain data but in a challenging task generalization setting on Meta-World, we further demonstrate more sample-efficient training than is possible with prior language-conditioned reward models that are either trained with binary classification, use static images, or do not leverage the temporal information present in video data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwon Lee, Jaekwon Im, Dabin Kim, Juhan Nam</p>
<p>Abstract: Foley sound synthesis is crucial for multimedia production, enhancing user experience by synchronizing audio and video both temporally and semantically. Recent studies on automating this labor-intensive process through video-to-sound generation face significant challenges. Systems lacking explicit temporal features suffer from poor alignment and controllability, while timestamp-based models require costly and subjective human annotation. We propose Video-Foley, a video-to-sound system using Root Mean Square (RMS) as an intuitive condition with semantic timbre prompts (audio or text). RMS, a frame-level intensity envelope closely related to audio semantics, acts as a temporal event feature to guide audio generation from video. The annotation-free self-supervised learning framework consists of two stages, Video2RMS and RMS2Sound, incorporating novel ideas including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet with a pretrained text-to-audio model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Video-Foley achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment and controllability for sound timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ismail Rasim Ulgen, Shreeram Suresh Chandra, Junchen Lu, Berrak Sisman</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthesizing the voices of unseen speakers remains a persisting challenge in multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS). Existing methods model speaker characteristics through speaker conditioning during training, leading to increased model complexity and limiting reproducibility and accessibility. A low-complexity alternative would broaden the reach of speech synthesis research, particularly in settings with limited computational and data resources. To this end, we propose SelectTTS, a simple and effective alternative. SelectTTS selects appropriate frames from the target speaker and decodes them using frame-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features. We demonstrate that this approach can effectively capture speaker characteristics for unseen speakers and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art multi-speaker TTS frameworks on both objective and subjective metrics. By directly selecting frames from the target speaker's speech, SelectTTS enables generalization to unseen speakers with significantly lower model complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art systems such as XTTS-v2 and VALL-E, while requiring over 8x fewer parameters and 270x less training data. Moreover, it demonstrates that frame selection with SSL features offers an efficient path to low-complexity, high-quality multi-speaker TTS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Legal research is a time-consuming task that most lawyers face on a daily basis. A large part of legal research entails looking up relevant caselaw and bringing it in relation to the case at hand. Lawyers heavily rely on summaries (also called headnotes) to find the right cases quickly. However, not all decisions are annotated with headnotes and writing them is time-consuming. Automated headnote creation has the potential to make hundreds of thousands of decisions more accessible for legal research in Switzerland alone. To kickstart this, we introduce the Swiss Leading Decision Summarization ( SLDS) dataset, a novel cross-lingual resource featuring 18K court rulings from the Swiss Federal Supreme Court (SFSC), in German, French, and Italian, along with German headnotes. We fine-tune and evaluate three mT5 variants, along with proprietary models. Our analysis highlights that while proprietary models perform well in zero-shot and one-shot settings, fine-tuned smaller models still provide a strong competitive edge. We publicly release the dataset to facilitate further research in multilingual legal summarization and the development of assistive technologies for legal professionals</p>

Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture behavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets, making it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential testing addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in DNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: many rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To address these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation approach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral discrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions, focusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input space and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically searching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that trigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it applicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs trained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly outperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with greater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the generated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model selection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input characteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using alternative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Cama\~no, Daniel Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Soft Kernel Interpolation (SoftKI), a method that combines aspects of Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) and variational inducing point methods, to achieve scalable Gaussian Process (GP) regression on high-dimensional datasets. SoftKI approximates a kernel via softmax interpolation from a smaller number of interpolation points learned by optimizing a combination of the SoftKI marginal log-likelihood (MLL), and when needed, an approximate MLL for improved numerical stability. Consequently, it can overcome the dimensionality scaling challenges that SKI faces when interpolating from a dense and static lattice while retaining the flexibility of variational methods to adapt inducing points to the dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SoftKI across various examples and show that it is competitive with other approximated GP methods when the data dimensionality is modest (around 10).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peizheng Li, Xinyi Lin, Adnan Aijaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Error detection and correction are essential for ensuring robust and reliable operation in modern communication systems, particularly in complex transmission environments. However, discussions on these topics have largely been overlooked in semantic communication (SemCom), which focuses on transmitting meaning rather than symbols, leading to significant improvements in communication efficiency. Despite these advantages, semantic errors -- stemming from discrepancies between transmitted and received meanings -- present a major challenge to system reliability. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a comprehensive framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in SemCom systems. We formally define semantic error, detection, and correction mechanisms, and identify key sources of semantic errors. To address these challenges, we develop a Gaussian process (GP)-based method for latent space monitoring to detect errors, alongside a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (HITL-RL) approach to optimize semantic model configurations using user feedback. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in mitigating semantic errors under various conditions, including adversarial attacks, input feature changes, physical channel variations, and user preference shifts. This work lays the foundation for more reliable and adaptive SemCom systems with robust semantic error management techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuele Pasini, Jinhan Kim, Tommaso Aiello, Rocio Cabrera Lozoya, Antonino Sabetta, Paolo Tonella</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development to generate functions, such as attack detectors, that implement security requirements. A key challenge is ensuring the LLMs have enough knowledge to address specific security requirements, such as information about existing attacks. For this, we propose an approach integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Self-Ranking into the LLM pipeline. RAG enhances the robustness of the output by incorporating external knowledge sources, while the Self-Ranking technique, inspired by the concept of Self-Consistency, generates multiple reasoning paths and creates ranks to select the most robust detector. Our extensive empirical study targets code generated by LLMs to detect two prevalent injection attacks in web security: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi). Results show a significant improvement in detection performance while employing RAG and Self-Ranking, with an increase of up to 71%pt (on average 37%pt) and up to 43%pt (on average 6%pt) in the F2-Score for XSS and SQLi detection, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jannik Graebner, Ryne Beeson</p>
<p>Abstract: Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nurit Cohen-Inger, Yehonatan Elisha, Bracha Shapira, Lior Rokach, Seffi Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often appear to excel on public benchmarks, but these high scores may mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. We introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via a parametric transformation and detects overfitting of LLMs. By rephrasing inputs while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes whether a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns. Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our method reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant differences. Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger performance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings, indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy show insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. Moreover, C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows easy integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding. Our findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandra Bakalova, Yana Veitsman, Xinting Huang, Michael Hahn</p>
<p>Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is an intriguing ability of large language models (LLMs). Despite a substantial amount of work on its behavioral aspects and how it emerges in miniature setups, it remains unclear which mechanism assembles task information from the individual examples in a fewshot prompt. We use causal interventions to identify information flow in Gemma-2 2B for five naturalistic ICL tasks. We find that the model infers task information using a two-step strategy we call contextualize-then-aggregate: In the lower layers, the model builds up representations of individual fewshot examples, which are contextualized by preceding examples through connections between fewshot input and output tokens across the sequence. In the higher layers, these representations are aggregated to identify the task and prepare prediction of the next output. The importance of the contextualization step differs between tasks, and it may become more important in the presence of ambiguous examples. Overall, by providing rigorous causal analysis, our results shed light on the mechanisms through which ICL happens in language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahjabin Nahar, Eun-Ju Lee, Jin Won Park, Dongwon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: While we increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, these models are known to produce inaccurate content or 'hallucinations' with potentially disastrous consequences. The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online experiment (N=560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e., participant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall evaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search results). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and perceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall self-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control conditions. We highlighted practical implications of incorporating web search functionality into LLMs in real-world contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Fahimuzzman Sohan, Raid Alzubi, Hadeel Alzoubi, Eid Albalawi, A. H. Abdul Hafez</p>
<p>Abstract: Cattle lameness is a prevalent health problem in livestock farming, often resulting from hoof injuries or infections, and severely impacts animal welfare and productivity. Early and accurate detection is critical for minimizing economic losses and ensuring proper treatment. This study proposes a spatiotemporal deep learning framework for automated cattle lameness detection using publicly available video data. We curate and publicly release a balanced set of 50 online video clips featuring 42 individual cattle, recorded from multiple viewpoints in both indoor and outdoor environments. The videos were categorized into lame and non-lame classes based on visual gait characteristics and metadata descriptions. After applying data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization, two deep learning architectures were trained and evaluated: 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) and Convolutional Long-Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM2D). The 3D CNN achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with a precision, recall, and F1 score of 90.9% each, outperforming the ConvLSTM2D model, which achieved 85% accuracy. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on multistage pipelines involving object detection and pose estimation, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a direct end-to-end video classification approach. Compared with the best end-to-end prior method (C3D-ConvLSTM, 90.3%), our model achieves comparable accuracy while eliminating pose estimation pre-processing.The results indicate that deep learning models can successfully extract and learn spatio-temporal features from various video sources, enabling scalable and efficient cattle lameness detection in real-world farm settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingye Zhou, Caiyang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio \'Alvarez-L\'opez, Marcos Matabuena</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of probability distributions from time-dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including digital health. The goal is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, changes over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases such as diabetes. We introduce a probabilistic model based on a Gaussian mixture that captures the evolution of a continuous-time stochastic process. Our approach combines a nonparametric estimate of the distribution, obtained with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that governs the temporal evolution of the mixture weights. The model is highly interpretable, detects subtle distribution shifts, and remains computationally efficient. We illustrate the broad utility of our approach in a 26-week clinical trial that treats all continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) time series as the primary outcome. This method enables rigorous longitudinal comparisons between the treatment and control arms and yields characterizations that conventional summary-based clinical trials analytical methods typically do not capture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmood Hegazy, Aaron Rodrigues, Azzam Naeem</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern consumer banking applications require accurate and efficient retrieval of information in response to user queries. Mapping user utterances to the most relevant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is a crucial component of these systems. Traditional approaches often rely on a single model or technique, which may not capture the nuances of diverse user inquiries. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for FAQ annotation that combines multiple specialized agents with different approaches and a judge agent that reranks candidates to produce optimal results. Our agents utilize a structured reasoning approach inspired by Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), which guides them through systematic reasoning steps using targeted, task-specific JSON queries. Our framework features a few-shot example strategy, where each agent receives different few-shots, enhancing ensemble diversity and coverage of the query space. We evaluate our framework on a real-world major bank dataset as well as public benchmark datasets (LCQMC and FiQA), demonstrating significant improvements over single-agent approaches across multiple metrics, including a 14% increase in Top-1 accuracy, an 18% increase in Top-5 accuracy, and a 12% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank on our dataset, and similar gains on public benchmarks when compared with traditional and single-agent annotation techniques. Our framework is particularly effective at handling ambiguous queries, making it well-suited for deployment in production banking applications while showing strong generalization capabilities across different domains and languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Licheng Pan, Yongqi Tong, Xin Zhang, Xiaolu Zhang, Jun Zhou, Zhixuan Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they often refuse to answer legitimate queries--a phenomenon known as overrefusal. Overrefusal typically stems from over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe and leverage the models' safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios. We have explored the safety decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple languages.

Experimental results demonstrate that SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual approaches for lyrics translation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and understanding visual metaphors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Terrance Liu, Shuyi Wang, Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro, Yash Chandarana, Chirag Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on text-to-SQL parsing, they sometimes exhibit unexpected failures in which they are confidently incorrect. Building trustworthy text-to-SQL systems thus requires eliciting reliable uncertainty measures from the LLM. In this paper, we study the problem of providing a calibrated confidence score that conveys the likelihood of an output query being correct. Our work is the first to establish a benchmark for post-hoc calibration of LLM-based text-to-SQL parsing. In particular, we show that Platt scaling, a canonical method for calibration, provides substantial improvements over directly using raw model output probabilities as confidence scores. Furthermore, we propose a method for text-to-SQL calibration that leverages the structured nature of SQL queries to provide more granular signals of correctness, named "sub-clause frequency" (SCF) scores. Using multivariate Platt scaling (MPS), our extension of the canonical Platt scaling technique, we combine individual SCF scores into an overall accurate and calibrated score. Empirical evaluation on two popular text-to-SQL datasets shows that our approach of combining MPS and SCF yields further improvements in calibration and the related task of error detection over traditional Platt scaling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation, transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior, demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for versatile robotic manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianxuan Long, Yao Fu, Runchao Li, Mu Sheng, Haotian Yu, Xiaotian Han, Pan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed dishonesty in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lishui Fan, Yu Zhang, Mouxiang Chen, Zhongxin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes. To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucong Zhang, Juan Liu, Ming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in audio, vision and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling with arbitrary sampling rates-covering acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel foundation model ECHO that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with frequency positional embeddings, enabling spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. Moreover, the model incorporates sliding patches to support inputs of variable length without padding or cropping, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity and naturally extends to streaming scenarios. We evaluate our method on various kinds of machine signal datasets, including previous DCASE task 2 challenges (2020-2025), and widely-used industrial signal corpora. Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in machine signal anomaly detection and fault classification, confirming the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed model. We open-sourced ECHO on https://github.com/yucongzh/ECHO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanxing Lu, Baoxiong Jia, Puhao Li, Yixin Chen, Ziwei Wang, Yansong Tang, Siyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Guillen-Perez</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and reliable autonomous agents.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03495">Learning AC Power Flow Solutions using a Data-Dependent Variational Quantum Circuit</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Thinh Viet Le, Md Obaidur Rahman, Vassilis Kekatos</p>
<p>Abstract: Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilong Wang, Turgay Ayer, Shihao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is critical in domains such as personalized medicine, resource allocation, and policy evaluation. A central challenge lies in identifying subpopulations that respond differently to interventions, thereby enabling more targeted and effective decision-making. While clustering methods are well-studied in unsupervised learning, their integration with causal inference remains limited. We propose a novel framework that clusters individuals based on estimated treatment effects using a learned kernel derived from causal forests, revealing latent subgroup structures. Our approach consists of two main steps. First, we estimate debiased Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) using orthogonalized learners via the Robinson decomposition, yielding a kernel matrix that encodes sample-level similarities in treatment responsiveness. Second, we apply kernelized clustering to this matrix to uncover distinct, treatment-sensitive subpopulations and compute cluster-level average CATEs. We present this kernelized clustering step as a form of regularization within the residual-on-residual regression framework. Through extensive experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, supported by ablation studies and exploratory analyses, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in capturing meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prathamesh Vasudeo Naik, Naresh Kumar Dintakurthi, Zhanghao Hu, Yue Wang, Robby Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains. This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection, external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting, align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable, reliable, and transparent SAR generation.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11070">A Kernel-based Stochastic Approximation Framework for Nonlinear Operator Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia-Qi Yang, Lei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a stochastic approximation framework for learning nonlinear operators between infinite-dimensional spaces utilizing general Mercer operator-valued kernels. Our framework encompasses two key classes: (i) compact kernels, which admit discrete spectral decompositions, and (ii) diagonal kernels of the form $K(x,x')=k(x,x')T$, where $k$ is a scalar-valued kernel and $T$ is a positive operator on the output space. This broad setting induces expressive vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that generalize the classical $K=kI$ paradigm, thereby enabling rich structural modeling with rigorous theoretical guarantees. To address target operators lying outside the RKHS, we introduce vector-valued interpolation spaces to precisely quantify misspecification error. Within this framework, we establish dimension-free polynomial convergence rates, demonstrating that nonlinear operator learning can overcome the curse of dimensionality. The use of general operator-valued kernels further allows us to derive rates for intrinsically nonlinear operator learning, going beyond the linear-type behavior inherent in diagonal constructions of $K=kI$. Importantly, this framework accommodates a wide range of operator learning tasks, ranging from integral operators such as Fredholm operators to architectures based on encoder-decoder representations. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11417">Enhancing Generalization in Vision-Language-Action Models by Preserving Pretrained Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shresth Grover, Akshay Gopalkrishnan, Bo Ai, Henrik I. Christensen, Hao Su, Xuanlin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models (VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations, generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success compared to baselines.</p>
