<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfan Zhao, Niclas Boehmer, Aparna Taneja, Milind Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: AI for social impact (AI4SI) offers significant potential for addressing complex societal challenges in areas such as public health, agriculture, education, conservation, and public safety. However, existing AI4SI research is often labor-intensive and resource-demanding, limiting its accessibility and scalability; the standard approach is to design a (base-level) system tailored to a specific AI4SI problem. We propose the development of a novel meta-level multi-agent system designed to accelerate the development of such base-level systems, thereby reducing the computational cost and the burden on social impact domain experts and AI researchers. Leveraging advancements in foundation models and large language models, our proposed approach focuses on resource allocation problems providing help across the full AI4SI pipeline from problem formulation over solution design to impact evaluation. We highlight the ethical considerations and challenges inherent in deploying such systems and emphasize the importance of a human-in-the-loop approach to ensure the responsible and effective application of AI systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07941">Beyond Static Assumptions: the Predictive Justified Perspective Model for Epistemic Planning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijia Li, Guang Hu, Yangmengfei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Epistemic Planning (EP) is an important research area dedicated to reasoning about the knowledge and beliefs of agents in multi-agent cooperative or adversarial settings. The Justified Perspective (JP) model is the state-of-the-art approach to solving EP problems with efficiency and expressiveness. However, all existing EP methods inherit the static environment assumption from classical planning. This limitation hinders the application of EP in fields such as robotics with multi-agent settings, where the environment contains changing variables.
  In this paper, we propose an extension of the JP model, namely, the Predictive Justified Perspective (PJP) model, to remove this assumption. Instead of assuming that beliefs remain unchanged since the last observation, the PJP model uses all past observations to form predictions about the changing variables. The definition of the prediction function with examples is provided, and it is demonstrated that it can work with arbitrary nesting. We then implemented the PJP model in several well-known domains and compared it with the JP model in the experiments. The results indicated that the PJP model performs exceptionally well across various domains, demonstrating its potential in improving EP applications in robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shambhavi Krishna, Zheng Chen, Vaibhav Kumar, Xiaojiang Huang, Yingjie Li, Fan Yang, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern AI assistants have made significant progress in natural language understanding and API/tool integration, with emerging efforts to incorporate diverse interfaces (such as Web interfaces) for enhanced scalability and functionality. However, current approaches that heavily rely on repeated LLM-driven HTML parsing are computationally expensive and error-prone, particularly when handling dynamic web interfaces and multi-step tasks. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PAFFA (Premeditated Actions For Fast Agents), a framework designed to enhance web interaction capabilities through an Action API Library of reusable, verified browser interaction functions. By pre-computing interaction patterns and employing two core methodologies - "Dist-Map" for task-agnostic element distillation and "Unravel" for incremental page-wise exploration - PAFFA reduces inference calls by 87% while maintaining robust performance even as website structures evolve. This framework accelerates multi-page task execution and offers a scalable solution to advance autonomous web agent research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07975">Machines of Meaning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Nunes, Luis Antunes</p>
<p>Abstract: One goal of Artificial Intelligence is to learn meaningful representations for natural language expressions, but what this entails is not always clear. A variety of new linguistic behaviours present themselves embodied as computers, enhanced humans, and collectives with various kinds of integration and communication. But to measure and understand the behaviours generated by such systems, we must clarify the language we use to talk about them. Computational models are often confused with the phenomena they try to model and shallow metaphors are used as justifications for (or to hype) the success of computational techniques on many tasks related to natural language; thus implying their progress toward human-level machine intelligence without ever clarifying what that means.
  This paper discusses the challenges in the specification of "machines of meaning", machines capable of acquiring meaningful semantics from natural language in order to achieve their goals. We characterize "meaning" in a computational setting, while highlighting the need for detachment from anthropocentrism in the study of the behaviour of machines of meaning. The pressing need to analyse AI risks and ethics requires a proper measurement of its capabilities which cannot be productively studied and explained while using ambiguous language. We propose a view of "meaning" to facilitate the discourse around approaches such as neural language models and help broaden the research perspectives for technology that facilitates dialogues between humans and machines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Dernbach, Alejandro Michel, Khushbu Agarwal, Christopher Brissette, Geetika Gupta, Sutanay Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces lateral thinking to implement System-2 reasoning capabilities in AI systems, focusing on anticipatory and causal reasoning under uncertainty. We present a framework for systematic generation and modeling of lateral thinking queries and evaluation datasets. We introduce Streaming Agentic Lateral Thinking (SALT), a multi-agent framework designed to process complex, low-specificity queries in streaming data environments. SALT implements lateral thinking-inspired System-2 reasoning through a dynamic communication structure between specialized agents. Our key insight is that lateral information flow across long-distance agent interactions, combined with fine-grained belief management, yields richer information contexts and enhanced reasoning. Preliminary quantitative and qualitative evaluations indicate SALT's potential to outperform single-agent systems in handling complex lateral reasoning tasks in a streaming environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuxiang Cao, Zijian Zhang, Mohammed Alghadeer, Simone D Fasciati, Michele Piscitelli, Mustafa Bakr, Peter Leek, Al\'an Aspuru-Guzik</p>
<p>Abstract: Fully automated self-driving laboratories are promising to enable high-throughput and large-scale scientific discovery by reducing repetitive labour. However, effective automation requires deep integration of laboratory knowledge, which is often unstructured, multimodal, and difficult to incorporate into current AI systems. This paper introduces the k-agents framework, designed to support experimentalists in organizing laboratory knowledge and automating experiments with agents. Our framework employs large language model-based agents to encapsulate laboratory knowledge including available laboratory operations and methods for analyzing experiment results. To automate experiments, we introduce execution agents that break multi-step experimental procedures into state machines, interact with other agents to execute each step and analyze the experiment results. The analyzed results are then utilized to drive state transitions, enabling closed-loop feedback control. To demonstrate its capabilities, we applied the agents to calibrate and operate a superconducting quantum processor, where they autonomously planned and executed experiments for hours, successfully producing and characterizing entangled quantum states at the level achieved by human scientists. Our knowledge-based agent system opens up new possibilities for managing laboratory knowledge and accelerating scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Hu, Tim Miller, Nir Lipovetzky</p>
<p>Abstract: Epistemic planning is the sub-field of AI planning that focuses on changing knowledge and belief. It is important in both multi-agent domains where agents need to have knowledge/belief regarding the environment, but also the beliefs of other agents, including nested beliefs. When modeling knowledge in multi-agent settings, many models face an exponential growth challenge in terms of nested depth. A contemporary method, known as Planning with Perspectives (PWP), addresses these challenges through the use of perspectives and set operations for knowledge. The JP model defines that an agent's belief is justified if and only if the agent has seen evidence that this belief was true in the past and has not seen evidence to suggest that this has changed. The current paper extends the JP model to handle \emph{group belief}, including distributed belief and common belief. We call this the Group Justified Perspective (GJP) model. Using experimental problems crafted by adapting well-known benchmarks to a group setting, we show the efficiency and expressiveness of our GJP model at handling planning problems that cannot be handled by other epistemic planning tools.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08273">Can transformative AI shape a new age for our civilization?: Navigating between speculation and reality</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesus L. Lobo, Javier Del Ser</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is widely regarded as a transformative force with the potential to redefine numerous sectors of human civilization. While Artificial Intelligence has evolved from speculative fiction to a pivotal element of technological progress, its role as a truly transformative agent, or transformative Artificial Intelligence, remains a subject of debate. This work explores the historical precedents of technological breakthroughs, examining whether Artificial Intelligence can achieve a comparable impact, and it delves into various ethical frameworks that shape the perception and development of Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, it considers the societal, technical, and regulatory challenges that must be addressed for Artificial Intelligence to become a catalyst for global change. We also examine not only the strategies and methodologies that could lead to transformative Artificial Intelligence but also the barriers that could ultimately make these goals unattainable. We end with a critical inquiry into whether reaching a transformative Artificial Intelligence might compel humanity to adopt an entirely new ethical approach, tailored to the complexities of advanced Artificial Intelligence. By addressing the ethical, social, and scientific dimensions of Artificial Intelligence's development, this work contributes to the broader discourse on the long-term implications of Artificial Intelligence and its capacity to drive civilization toward a new era of progress or, conversely, exacerbate existing inequalities and risks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present TapeAgents, an agent framework built around a granular, structured log tape of the agent session that also plays the role of the session's resumable state. In TapeAgents we leverage tapes to facilitate all stages of the LLM Agent development lifecycle. The agent reasons by processing the tape and the LLM output to produce new thought and action steps and append them to the tape. The environment then reacts to the agent's actions by likewise appending observation steps to the tape. By virtue of this tape-centred design, TapeAgents can provide AI practitioners with holistic end-to-end support. At the development stage, tapes facilitate session persistence, agent auditing, and step-by-step debugging. Post-deployment, one can reuse tapes for evaluation, fine-tuning, and prompt-tuning; crucially, one can adapt tapes from other agents or use revised historical tapes. In this report, we explain the TapeAgents design in detail. We demonstrate possible applications of TapeAgents with several concrete examples of building monolithic agents and multi-agent teams, of optimizing agent prompts and finetuning the agent's LLM. We present tooling prototypes and report a case study where we use TapeAgents to finetune a Llama-3.1-8B form-filling assistant to perform as well as GPT-4o while being orders of magnitude cheaper. Lastly, our comparative analysis shows that TapeAgents's advantages over prior frameworks stem from our novel design of the LLM agent as a resumable, modular state machine with a structured configuration, that generates granular, structured logs and that can transform these logs into training text -- a unique combination of features absent in previous work.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08457">Efficient Rectification of Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Inconsistencies by Abductive Reflection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Chao Hu, Wang-Zhou Dai, Yuan Jiang, Zhi-Hua Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI could be regarded as an analogy to human dual-process cognition, modeling the intuitive System 1 with neural networks and the algorithmic System 2 with symbolic reasoning. However, for complex learning targets, NeSy systems often generate outputs inconsistent with domain knowledge and it is challenging to rectify them. Inspired by the human Cognitive Reflection, which promptly detects errors in our intuitive response and revises them by invoking the System 2 reasoning, we propose to improve NeSy systems by introducing Abductive Reflection (ABL-Refl) based on the Abductive Learning (ABL) framework. ABL-Refl leverages domain knowledge to abduce a reflection vector during training, which can then flag potential errors in the neural network outputs and invoke abduction to rectify them and generate consistent outputs during inference. ABL-Refl is highly efficient in contrast to previous ABL implementations. Experiments show that ABL-Refl outperforms state-of-the-art NeSy methods, achieving excellent accuracy with fewer training resources and enhanced efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Describing skills in natural language has the potential to provide an accessible way to inject human knowledge about decision-making into an AI system. We present MaestroMotif, a method for AI-assisted skill design, which yields high-performing and adaptable agents. MaestroMotif leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively create and reuse skills. It first uses an LLM's feedback to automatically design rewards corresponding to each skill, starting from their natural language description. Then, it employs an LLM's code generation abilities, together with reinforcement learning, for training the skills and combining them to implement complex behaviors specified in language. We evaluate MaestroMotif using a suite of complex tasks in the NetHack Learning Environment (NLE), demonstrating that it surpasses existing approaches in both performance and usability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Aichm\"uller, Hector Geffner</p>
<p>Abstract: In planning and reinforcement learning, the identification of common subgoal structures across problems is important when goals are to be achieved over long horizons. Recently, it has been shown that such structures can be expressed as feature-based rules, called sketches, over a number of classical planning domains. These sketches split problems into subproblems which then become solvable in low polynomial time by a greedy sequence of IW$(k)$ searches. Methods for learning sketches using feature pools and min-SAT solvers have been developed, yet they face two key limitations: scalability and expressivity. In this work, we address these limitations by formulating the problem of learning sketch decompositions as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) task, where general policies are sought in a modified planning problem where the successor states of a state s are defined as those reachable from s through an IW$(k)$ search. The sketch decompositions obtained through this method are experimentally evaluated across various domains, and problems are regarded as solved by the decomposition when the goal is reached through a greedy sequence of IW$(k)$ searches. While our DRL approach for learning sketch decompositions does not yield interpretable sketches in the form of rules, we demonstrate that the resulting decompositions can often be understood in a crisp manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biqing Qi, Zhouyi Qian, Yiang Luo, Junqi Gao, Dong Li, Kaiyan Zhang, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: As multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied to complex reasoning tasks, the diversity and quality of reasoning paths become crucial factors affecting their performance. Although current methods aim to enhance reasoning quality through path expansion, they often neglect the diversity of reasoning paths and effective information sharing, leading to local optima and inefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Evolution of Thought (EoT), a multi-objective framework designed to improve reasoning by fostering both high-quality and diverse reasoning paths. Specifically, we introduce the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II for multi-objective optimization, utilizing crossover and mutation operators to promote greater diversity in reasoning solutions. Additionally, we propose a Condensation-Aggregation mechanism to cluster and eliminate redundant paths, facilitate improved information sharing among parent nodes, and ultimately enhance both the efficiency and quality of the reasoning process. Validation experiments on various vision-language and language reasoning tasks demonstrate that EoT achieves superior reasoning performance and efficiency compared to other competitive baselines. Our study provides a novel perspective on the design of heuristic reasoning frameworks for MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The present study aims to evaluate the current fuzzy landscape of Trustworthy AI (TAI) within the European Union (EU), with a specific focus on the energy sector. The analysis encompasses legal frameworks, directives, initiatives, and standards like the AI Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (EGTAI), the Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI), the AI act, and relevant CEN-CENELEC standardization efforts, as well as EU-funded projects such as AI4EU and SHERPA. Subsequently, we introduce a new TAI application framework, called E-TAI, tailored for energy applications, including smart grid and smart building systems. This framework draws inspiration from EGTAI but is customized for AI systems in the energy domain. It is designed for stakeholders in electrical power and energy systems (EPES), including researchers, developers, and energy experts linked to transmission system operators, distribution system operators, utilities, and aggregators. These stakeholders can utilize E-TAI to develop and evaluate AI services for the energy sector with a focus on ensuring trustworthiness throughout their development and iterative assessment processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and reliable electricity price forecasting has significant practical implications for grid management, renewable energy integration, power system planning, and price volatility management. This study focuses on enhancing electricity price forecasting in California's grid, addressing challenges from complex generation data and heteroskedasticity. Utilizing principal component analysis (PCA), we analyze CAISO's hourly electricity prices and demand from 2016-2021 to improve day-ahead forecasting accuracy. Initially, we apply traditional outlier analysis with the interquartile range method, followed by robust PCA (RPCA) for more effective outlier elimination. This approach improves data symmetry and reduces skewness. We then construct multiple linear regression models using both raw and PCA-transformed features. The model with transformed features, refined through traditional and SAS Sparse Matrix outlier removal methods, shows superior forecasting performance. The SAS Sparse Matrix method, in particular, significantly enhances model accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that PCA-based methods are key in advancing electricity price forecasting, supporting renewable integration and grid management in day-ahead markets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudio Novelli, Giulia Sandri</p>
<p>Abstract: This chapter explores the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on digital democracy, focusing on four main areas: citizenship, participation, representation, and the public sphere. It traces the evolution from electronic to virtual and network democracy, underscoring how each stage has broadened democratic engagement through technology. Focusing on digital citizenship, the chapter examines how AI can improve online engagement and promote ethical behaviour while posing privacy risks and fostering identity stereotyping. Regarding political participation, it highlights AI's dual role in mobilising civic actions and spreading misinformation. Regarding representation, AI's involvement in electoral processes can enhance voter registration, e-voting, and the efficiency of result tabulation but raises concerns regarding privacy and public trust. Also, AI's predictive capabilities shift the dynamics of political competition, posing ethical questions about manipulation and the legitimacy of democracy. Finally, the chapter examines how integrating AI and digital technologies can facilitate democratic political advocacy and personalised communication. However, this also comes with higher risks of misinformation and targeted propaganda.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariful Azad, Afeefa Banu</p>
<p>Abstract: Papers published in top conferences contribute influential discoveries that are reshaping the landscape of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI). We analyzed 87,137 papers from 11 AI conferences to examine publication trends over the past decade. Our findings reveal a consistent increase in both the number of papers and authors, reflecting the growing interest in AI research. We also observed a rise in prolific researchers who publish dozens of papers at the same conference each year. In light of this analysis, the AI research community should consider revisiting authorship policies, addressing equity concerns, and evaluating the workload of junior researchers to foster a more sustainable and inclusive research environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Pietrusky</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) offers various possibilities to expand and support educational research. Specifically, the implementation of AI can be used to develop new frameworks to establish new research tools that accelerate and meaningfully expand the efficiency of data evaluation and interpretation (Buckingham Shum et al., 2023). This article presents the prototype of the FACTS-V1 (Filtering and Analysis of Content in Textual Sources) framework. With the help of the application, numerous scientific papers can be automatically extracted, analyzed and interpreted from open access document servers without having to rely on proprietary applications and their limitations. The FACTS-V1 prototype consists of three building blocks. The first part deals with the extraction of texts, the second with filtering and interpretation, and the last with the actual statistical evaluation (topic modeling) using an interactive overview. The aim of the framework is to provide recommendations for future scientific questions based on existing data. The functionality is illustrated by asking how the use of AI will change the education sector. The data used to answer the question comes from 82 scientific papers on the topic of AI from 2024. The papers are publicly available on the peDOCS document server of the Leibniz Institute for Educational Research and Educational Information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqing Wu, Zhu Sun, Dongxia Wang, Lu Zhang, Jie Zhang, Yew Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential for next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. However, existing methods only perform direct zero-shot prompting, leading to ineffective extraction of user preferences, insufficient injection of collaborative signals, and a lack of user privacy protection. As such, we propose a novel Multitask Reflective Large Language Model for Privacy-preserving Next POI Recommendation (MRP-LLM), aiming to exploit LLMs for better next POI recommendation while preserving user privacy. Specifically, the Multitask Reflective Preference Extraction Module first utilizes LLMs to distill each user's fine-grained (i.e., categorical, temporal, and spatial) preferences into a knowledge base (KB). The Neighbor Preference Retrieval Module retrieves and summarizes the preferences of similar users from the KB to obtain collaborative signals. Subsequently, aggregating the user's preferences with those of similar users, the Multitask Next POI Recommendation Module generates the next POI recommendations via multitask prompting. Meanwhile, during data collection, a Privacy Transmission Module is specifically devised to preserve sensitive POI data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed MRP-LLM in providing more accurate next POI recommendations with user privacy preserved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiali Chen, Xusen Hei, Yuqi Xue, Yuancheng Wei, Jiayuan Xie, Yi Cai, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable performance in the visual commonsense reasoning (VCR) task, which aims to answer a multiple-choice question based on visual commonsense within an image. However, the ability of LMMs to correct potential visual commonsense errors in the distractor upon their occurrence is yet under-explored. Drawing inspiration from how a human teacher crafts challenging distractors to test students' comprehension of the concepts or skills and assists them in identifying and correcting errors toward the answer, we are the pioneering research for LMMs to simulate this error correction process. To this end, we employ GPT-4 as a ``teacher'' to collect the explainable feedback dataset VCR-DF for error correction, which serves as a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LMMs to identify misconceptions and clarify reasons behind the error in VCR distractors toward final answers. In addition, we propose an LMM-based Pedagogical Expert Instructed Feedback Generation (PEIFG) model to incorporate the learnable expert prompts and multimodal instruction as guidance for feedback generation. Experimental results show that our PEIFG significantly outperforms existing LMMs. We believe that our benchmark provides a new direction for evaluating the capabilities of LMMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghao Zhu, Yifei Chen, Shuo Jiang, Weihong Chen, Chang Liu, Yuanhan Wang, Xu Chen, Yifan Ke, Feiwei Qin, Zhu Zhu, Changmiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurogliomas are among the most aggressive forms of cancer, presenting considerable challenges in both treatment and monitoring due to their unpredictable biological behavior. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently the preferred method for diagnosing and monitoring gliomas. However, the lack of specific imaging techniques often compromises the accuracy of tumor segmentation during the imaging process. To address this issue, we introduce the XLSTM-HVED model. This model integrates a hetero-modal encoder-decoder framework with the Vision XLSTM module to reconstruct missing MRI modalities. By deeply fusing spatial and temporal features, it enhances tumor segmentation performance. The key innovation of our approach is the Self-Attention Variational Encoder (SAVE) module, which improves the integration of modal features. Additionally, it optimizes the interaction of features between segmentation and reconstruction tasks through the Squeeze-Fusion-Excitation Cross Awareness (SFECA) module. Our experiments using the BraTS 2024 dataset demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing advanced methods in handling cases where modalities are missing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venkat Margapuri</p>
<p>Abstract: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an incurable inflammatory bowel disease that leads to ulcers along the large intestine and rectum. The increase in the prevalence of UC coupled with gastrointestinal physician shortages stresses the healthcare system and limits the care UC patients receive. A colonoscopy is performed to diagnose UC and assess its severity based on the Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES). The MES ranges between zero and three, wherein zero indicates no inflammation and three indicates that the inflammation is markedly high. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based neural network models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are capable of analyzing colonoscopies to diagnose and determine the severity of UC by modeling colonoscopy analysis as a multi-class classification problem. Prior research for AI-based UC diagnosis relies on supervised learning approaches that require large annotated datasets to train the CNNs. However, creating such datasets necessitates that domain experts invest a significant amount of time, rendering the process expensive and challenging. To address the challenge, this research employs self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks that can efficiently train on unannotated datasets to analyze colonoscopies and, aid in diagnosing UC and its severity. A comparative analysis with supervised learning models shows that SSL frameworks, such as SwAV and SparK outperform supervised learning models on the LIMUC dataset, the largest publicly available annotated dataset of colonoscopy images for UC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Myeongseob Ko, Henry Li, Zhun Wang, Jonathan Patsenker, Jiachen T. Wang, Qinbin Li, Ming Jin, Dawn Song, Ruoxi Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale generative models have shown impressive image-generation capabilities, propelled by massive data. However, this often inadvertently leads to the generation of harmful or inappropriate content and raises copyright concerns. Driven by these concerns, machine unlearning has become crucial to effectively purge undesirable knowledge from models. While existing literature has studied various unlearning techniques, these often suffer from either poor unlearning quality or degradation in text-image alignment after unlearning, due to the competitive nature of these objectives. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that seeks an optimal model update at each unlearning iteration, ensuring monotonic improvement on both objectives. We further derive the characterization of such an update.
  In addition, we design procedures to strategically diversify the unlearning and remaining datasets to boost performance improvement. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively removes target classes from recent diffusion-based generative models and concepts from stable diffusion models while maintaining close alignment with the models' original trained states, thus outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengheng Liu, Tianqi Zhang, Ningning Fu, Yongming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: AI becomes increasingly vital for telecom industry, as the burgeoning complexity of upcoming mobile communication networks places immense pressure on network operators. While there is a growing consensus that intelligent network self-driving holds the key, it heavily relies on expert experience and knowledge extracted from network data. In an effort to facilitate convenient analytics and utilization of wireless big data, we introduce the concept of knowledge graphs into the field of mobile networks, giving rise to what we term as wireless data knowledge graphs (WDKGs). However, the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of communication networks renders manual WDKG construction both prohibitively costly and error-prone, presenting a fundamental challenge. In this context, we propose an unsupervised data-and-model driven graph structure learning (DMGSL) framework, aimed at automating WDKG refinement and updating. Tackling WDKG heterogeneity involves stratifying the network into homogeneous layers and refining it at a finer granularity. Furthermore, to capture WDKG dynamics effectively, we segment the network into static snapshots based on the coherence time and harness the power of recurrent neural networks to incorporate historical information. Extensive experiments conducted on the established WDKG demonstrate the superiority of the DMGSL over the baselines, particularly in terms of node classification accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joohyung Lee, Jungchan Cho, Wonjun Lee, Mohamed Seif, H. Vincent Poor</p>
<p>Abstract: To alleviate the training burden in federated learning while enhancing convergence speed, Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising approach by combining the advantages of federated and split learning. However, recent studies have largely overlooked competitive situations. In this framework, the SFL model owner can choose the cut layer to balance the training load between the server and clients, ensuring the necessary level of privacy for the clients. Additionally, the SFL model owner sets incentives to encourage client participation in the SFL process. The optimization strategies employed by the SFL model owner influence clients' decisions regarding the amount of data they contribute, taking into account the shared incentives over clients and anticipated energy consumption during SFL. To address this framework, we model the problem using a hierarchical decision-making approach, formulated as a single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium among clients and analyze the Stackelberg equilibrium by examining the leader's game. Furthermore, we discuss privacy concerns related to differential privacy and the criteria for selecting the minimum required cut layer. Our findings show that the Stackelberg equilibrium solution maximizes the utility for both the clients and the SFL model owner.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated drug discovery offers significant potential for accelerating the development of novel therapeutics by substituting labor-intensive human workflows with machine-driven processes. However, a critical bottleneck persists in the inability of current automated frameworks to assess whether newly designed molecules infringe upon existing patents, posing significant legal and financial risks. We introduce PatentFinder, a novel tool-enhanced and multi-agent framework that accurately and comprehensively evaluates small molecules for patent infringement. It incorporates both heuristic and model-based tools tailored for decomposed subtasks, featuring: MarkushParser, which is capable of optical chemical structure recognition of molecular and Markush structures, and MarkushMatcher, which enhances large language models' ability to extract substituent groups from molecules accurately. On our benchmark dataset MolPatent-240, PatentFinder outperforms baseline approaches that rely solely on large language models, demonstrating a 13.8\% increase in F1-score and a 12\% rise in accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PatentFinder mitigates label bias to produce balanced predictions and autonomously generates detailed, interpretable patent infringement reports. This work not only addresses a pivotal challenge in automated drug discovery but also demonstrates the potential of decomposing complex scientific tasks into manageable subtasks for specialized, tool-augmented agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lennart Schneider, Martin Wistuba, Aaron Klein, Jacek Golebiowski, Giovanni Zappella, Felice Antonio Merra</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal prompt selection is crucial for maximizing large language model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks. As the most powerful models are proprietary and can only be invoked via an API, users often manually refine prompts in a black-box setting by adjusting instructions and few-shot examples until they achieve good performance as measured on a validation set. Recent methods addressing static black-box prompt selection face significant limitations: They often fail to leverage the inherent structure of prompts, treating instructions and few-shot exemplars as a single block of text. Moreover, they often lack query-efficiency by evaluating prompts on all validation instances, or risk sub-optimal selection of a prompt by using random subsets of validation instances. We introduce HbBoPs, a novel Hyperband-based Bayesian optimization method for black-box prompt selection addressing these key limitations. Our approach combines a structural-aware deep kernel Gaussian Process to model prompt performance with Hyperband as a multi-fidelity scheduler to select the number of validation instances for prompt evaluations. The structural-aware modeling approach utilizes separate embeddings for instructions and few-shot exemplars, enhancing the surrogate model's ability to capture prompt performance and predict which prompt to evaluate next in a sample-efficient manner. Together with Hyperband as a multi-fidelity scheduler we further enable query-efficiency by adaptively allocating resources across different fidelity levels, keeping the total number of validation instances prompts are evaluated on low. Extensive evaluation across ten benchmarks and three LLMs demonstrate that HbBoPs outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel AI-based approach to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion in relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state. Traditional root-finding methods are computationally intensive, particularly in large-scale simulations. To address this, we employ feedforward neural networks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU inference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal loss in accuracy. The NNC2PS model achieves $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ errors of $4.54 \times 10^{-7}$ and $3.44 \times 10^{-6}$, respectively, with the NNC2PL model yielding even lower error values. TensorRT optimization ensures high accuracy, with FP16 quantization offering 7x faster performance than traditional root-finding methods. Our AI models outperform conventional CPU solvers, demonstrating enhanced inference times, particularly for large datasets. We release the scientific software developed for this work, enabling the validation and extension of our findings. These results highlight the potential of AI, combined with GPU optimization, to significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of numerical relativity simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The diagnosis of diseases in food crops based on machine learning seemed satisfactory and suitable for use on a large scale. The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) perform accurately in the disease prediction considering the image capture of the crop leaf, being extensively enhanced in the literature. These machine learning techniques fall short in data privacy, as they require sharing the data in the training process with a central server, disregarding competitive or regulatory concerns. Thus, Federated Learning (FL) aims to support distributed training to address recognized gaps in centralized training. As far as we know, this paper inaugurates the use and evaluation of FL applied in maize leaf diseases. We evaluated the performance of five CNNs trained under the distributed paradigm and measured their training time compared to the classification performance. In addition, we consider the suitability of distributed training considering the volume of network traffic and the number of parameters of each CNN. Our results indicate that FL potentially enhances data privacy in heterogeneous domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: The classification of harmful brain activities, such as seizures and periodic discharges, play a vital role in neurocritical care, enabling timely diagnosis and intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive method for monitoring brain activity, but the manual interpretation of EEG signals are time-consuming and rely heavily on expert judgment. This study presents a comparative analysis of deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and EEGNet, applied to the classification of harmful brain activities using both raw EEG data and time-frequency representations generated through Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). We evaluate the performance of these models use multimodal data representations, including high-resolution spectrograms and waveform data, and introduce a multi-stage training strategy to improve model robustness. Our results show that training strategies, data preprocessing, and augmentation techniques are as critical to model success as architecture choice, with multi-stage TinyViT and EfficientNet demonstrating superior performance. The findings underscore the importance of robust training regimes in achieving accurate and efficient EEG classification, providing valuable insights for deploying AI models in clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Loconte, Antonio Vergari</p>
<p>Abstract: Squared tensor networks (TNs) and their generalization as parameterized computational graphs -- squared circuits -- have been recently used as expressive distribution estimators in high dimensions. However, the squaring operation introduces additional complexity when marginalizing variables or computing the partition function, which hinders their usage in machine learning applications. Canonical forms of popular TNs are parameterized via unitary matrices as to simplify the computation of particular marginals, but cannot be mapped to general circuits since these might not correspond to a known TN. Inspired by TN canonical forms, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to ensure they encode already normalized distributions. We then use this parameterization to devise an algorithm to compute any marginal of squared circuits that is more efficient than a previously known one. We conclude by formally showing the proposed parameterization comes with no expressiveness loss for many circuit classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> J. Toivanen, V. Kolehmainen, A. Paldanius, A. H\"anninen, A. Hauptmann, S. J. Hamilton</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: To develop a fast image reconstruction method for stroke monitoring with electrical impedance tomography with image quality comparable to computationally expensive nonlinear model-based methods. Methods: A post-processing approach with graph convolutional networks is employed. Utilizing the flexibility of the graph setting, a graph U-net is trained on linear difference reconstructions from 2D simulated stroke data and applied to fully 3D images from realistic simulated and experimental data. An additional network, trained on 3D vs. 2D images, is also considered for comparison. Results: Post-processing the linear difference reconstructions through the graph U-net significantly improved the image quality, resulting in images comparable to, or better than, the time-intensive nonlinear reconstruction method (a few minutes vs. several hours). Conclusion: Pairing a fast reconstruction method, such as linear difference imaging, with post-processing through a graph U-net provided significant improvements, at a negligible computational cost. Training in the graph framework vs classic pixel-based setting (CNN) allowed the ability to train on 2D cross-sectional images and process 3D volumes providing a nearly 50x savings in data simulation costs with no noticeable loss in quality. Significance: The proposed approach of post-processing a linear difference reconstruction with the graph U-net could be a feasible approach for on-line monitoring of hemorrhagic stroke.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Matsson, Lena Stempfle, Yaochen Rao, Zachary R. Margolin, Heather J. Litman, Fredrik D. Johansson</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling policies for sequential clinical decision-making based on observational data is useful for describing treatment practices, standardizing frequent patterns in treatment, and evaluating alternative policies. For each task, it is essential that the policy model is interpretable. Learning accurate models requires effectively capturing the state of a patient, either through sequence representation learning or carefully crafted summaries of their medical history. While recent work has favored the former, it remains a question as to how histories should best be represented for interpretable policy modeling. Focused on model fit, we systematically compare diverse approaches to summarizing patient history for interpretable modeling of clinical policies across four sequential decision-making tasks. We illustrate differences in the policies learned using various representations by breaking down evaluations by patient subgroups, critical states, and stages of treatment, highlighting challenges specific to common use cases. We find that interpretable sequence models using learned representations perform on par with black-box models across all tasks. Interpretable models using hand-crafted representations perform substantially worse when ignoring history entirely, but are made competitive by incorporating only a few aggregated and recent elements of patient history. The added benefits of using a richer representation are pronounced for subgroups and in specific use cases. This underscores the importance of evaluating policy models in the context of their intended use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Robbins</p>
<p>Abstract: We derive a general change of variables formula for score functions, showing that for a smooth, invertible transformation $\mathbf{y} = \phi(\mathbf{x})$, the transformed score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q(\mathbf{y})$ can be expressed directly in terms of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\mathbf{x})$. Using this result, we develop two applications: First, we establish a reverse-time It\^o lemma for score-based diffusion models, allowing the use of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ to reverse an SDE in the transformed space without directly learning $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q_t(\mathbf{y})$. This approach enables training diffusion models in one space but sampling in another, effectively decoupling the forward and reverse processes. Second, we introduce generalized sliced score matching, extending traditional sliced score matching from linear projections to arbitrary smooth transformations. This provides greater flexibility in high-dimensional density estimation. We demonstrate these theoretical advances through applications to diffusion on the probability simplex and empirically compare our generalized score matching approach against traditional sliced score matching methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Yaras, Siyi Chen, Peng Wang, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning has recently gained significant popularity, demonstrating impressive performance across various zero-shot classification tasks and a range of perceptive and generative applications. Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) are designed to bridge different modalities, such as images and text, by learning a shared representation space through contrastive learning. Despite their success, the working mechanisms underlying multimodal learning are not yet well understood. Notably, these models often exhibit a modality gap, where different modalities occupy distinct regions within the shared representation space. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the emergence of modality gap by characterizing the gradient flow learning dynamics. Specifically, we identify the critical roles of mismatched data pairs and a learnable temperature parameter in causing and perpetuating the modality gap during training. Furthermore, our theoretical insights are validated through experiments on practical CLIP models. These findings provide principled guidance for mitigating the modality gap, including strategies such as appropriate temperature scheduling and modality swapping. Additionally, we demonstrate that closing the modality gap leads to improved performance on tasks such as image-text retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Hu, Wei Ye, Jiaxiang Tang, Eman Ramadan, Zhi-Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Description Coding (MDC) is a promising error-resilient source coding method that is particularly suitable for dynamic networks with multiple (yet noisy and unreliable) paths. However, conventional MDC video codecs suffer from cumbersome architectures, poor scalability, limited loss resilience, and lower compression efficiency. As a result, MDC has never been widely adopted. Inspired by the potential of neural video codecs, this paper rethinks MDC design. We propose a novel MDC video codec, NeuralMDC, demonstrating how bidirectional transformers trained for masked token prediction can vastly simplify the design of MDC video codec. To compress a video, NeuralMDC starts by tokenizing each frame into its latent representation and then splits the latent tokens to create multiple descriptions containing correlated information. Instead of using motion prediction and warping operations, NeuralMDC trains a bidirectional masked transformer to model the spatial-temporal dependencies of latent representations and predict the distribution of the current representation based on the past. The predicted distribution is used to independently entropy code each description and infer any potentially lost tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate NeuralMDC achieves state-of-the-art loss resilience with minimal sacrifices in compression efficiency, significantly outperforming the best existing residual-coding-based error-resilient neural video codec.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henry Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models generate samples by incrementally reversing a process that turns data into noise. We show that when the step size goes to zero, the reversed process is invariant to the distribution of these increments. This reveals a previously unconsidered parameter in the design of diffusion models: the distribution of the diffusion step $\Delta x_k := x_{k} - x_{k + 1}$. This parameter is implicitly set by default to be normally distributed in most diffusion models. By lifting this assumption, we generalize the framework for designing diffusion models and establish an expanded class of diffusion processes with greater flexibility in the choice of loss function used during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on density estimation and generative modeling tasks on standard image datasets, and show that different choices of the distribution of $\Delta x_k$ result in qualitatively different generated samples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the general priniciples behind transformer models remains a complex endeavor. Experiments with probing and disentangling features using sparse autoencoders (SAE) suggest that these models might manage linear features embedded as directions in the residual stream. This paper explores the resemblance between decoder-only transformer architecture and vector symbolic architectures (VSA) and presents experiments indicating that GPT-2 uses mechanisms involving nearly orthogonal vector bundling and binding operations similar to VSA for computation and communication between layers. It further shows that these principles help explain a significant portion of the actual neural weights.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent gain in popularity of AI conversational agents has led to their increased use for improving productivity and supporting well-being. While previous research has aimed to understand the risks associated with interactions with AI conversational agents, these studies often fall short in capturing the lived experiences. Additionally, psychological risks have often been presented as a sub-category within broader AI-related risks in past taxonomy works, leading to under-representation of the impact of psychological risks of AI use. To address these challenges, our work presents a novel risk taxonomy focusing on psychological risks of using AI gathered through lived experience of individuals. We employed a mixed-method approach, involving a comprehensive survey with 283 individuals with lived mental health experience and workshops involving lived experience experts to develop a psychological risk taxonomy. Our taxonomy features 19 AI behaviors, 21 negative psychological impacts, and 15 contexts related to individuals. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-path vignette based framework for understanding the complex interplay between AI behaviors, psychological impacts, and individual user contexts. Finally, based on the feedback obtained from the workshop sessions, we present design recommendations for developing safer and more robust AI agents. Our work offers an in-depth understanding of the psychological risks associated with AI conversational agents and provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and developers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxi Xu, Ava Chen, Lauren Winterbottom, Joaquin Palacios, Preethika Chivukula, Dawn M. Nilsen, Joel Stein, Matei Ciocarlie</p>
<p>Abstract: Intent inferral, the process by which a robotic device predicts a user's intent from biosignals, offers an effective and intuitive way to control wearable robots. Classical intent inferral methods treat biosignal inputs as unidirectional ground truths for training machine learning models, where the internal state of the model is not directly observable by the user. In this work, we propose reciprocal learning, a bidirectional paradigm that facilitates human adaptation to an intent inferral classifier. Our paradigm consists of iterative, interwoven stages that alternate between updating machine learning models and guiding human adaptation with the use of augmented visual feedback. We demonstrate this paradigm in the context of controlling a robotic hand orthosis for stroke, where the device predicts open, close, and relax intents from electromyographic (EMG) signals and provides appropriate assistance. We use LED progress-bar displays to communicate to the user the predicted probabilities for open and close intents by the classifier. Our experiments with stroke subjects show reciprocal learning improving performance in a subset of subjects (two out of five) without negatively impacting performance on the others. We hypothesize that, during reciprocal learning, subjects can learn to reproduce more distinguishable muscle activation patterns and generate more separable biosignals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs) is important for properly evaluating LLMs, and ensuring safety for users. However, prior approaches to uncertainty estimation focus on the final answer in generated text, ignoring intermediate steps that might dramatically impact the outcome. We hypothesize that there exist key forking tokens, such that re-sampling the system at those specific tokens, but not others, leads to very different outcomes. To test this empirically, we develop a novel approach to representing uncertainty dynamics across individual tokens of text generation, and applying statistical models to test our hypothesis. Our approach is highly flexible: it can be applied to any dataset and any LLM, without fine tuning or accessing model weights. We use our method to analyze LLM responses on 7 different tasks across 4 domains, spanning a wide range of typical use cases. We find many examples of forking tokens, including surprising ones such as punctuation marks, suggesting that LLMs are often just a single token away from saying something very different.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajay Jagannath, Aayush Upadhyay, Anant Mehta</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a pivotal framework for representation learning, underpinning advances in both unimodal and bimodal applications like SimCLR and CLIP. To address fundamental limitations like large batch size dependency and bimodality, methods such as SogCLR leverage stochastic optimization for the global contrastive objective. Inspired by SogCLR's efficiency and adaptability, we introduce AmCLR and xAmCLR objective functions tailored for bimodal vision-language models to further enhance the robustness of contrastive learning. AmCLR integrates diverse augmentations, including text paraphrasing and image transformations, to reinforce the alignment of contrastive representations, keeping batch size limited to a few hundred samples unlike CLIP which needs batch size of 32,768 to produce reasonable results. xAmCLR further extends this paradigm by incorporating intra-modal alignments between original and augmented modalities for richer feature learning. These advancements yield a more resilient and generalizable contrastive learning process, aimed at overcoming bottlenecks in scaling and augmentative diversity. Since we have built our framework on the existing SogCLR, we are able to demonstrate improved representation quality with fewer computational resources, establishing a foundation for scalable and robust multi-modal learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxi Lei, Chunwei Ma, Meng Ding, Yufan Zhou, Ziyun Huang, Jinhui Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle with generalization when deploying on real-world data, due to the common distributional shift to the training data. Test-time adaptation (TTA) is an emerging scheme used at inference time to address this issue. In TTA, models are adapted online at the same time when making predictions to test data. Neighbor-based approaches have gained attention recently, where prototype embeddings provide location information to alleviate the feature shift between training and testing data. However, due to their inherit limitation of simplicity, they often struggle to learn useful patterns and encounter performance degradation. To confront this challenge, we study the TTA problem from a geometric point of view. We first reveal that the underlying structure of neighbor-based methods aligns with the Voronoi Diagram, a classical computational geometry model for space partitioning. Building on this observation, we propose the Test-Time adjustment by Voronoi Diagram guidance (TTVD), a novel framework that leverages the benefits of this geometric property. Specifically, we explore two key structures: 1) Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD): This integrates the joint contribution of self-supervision and entropy-based methods to provide richer information. 2) Power Diagram (PD): A generalized version of the Voronoi Diagram that refines partitions by assigning weights to each Voronoi cell. Our experiments under rigid, peer-reviewed settings on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-R shows that TTVD achieves remarkable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experimental results also explore the effects of batch size and class imbalance, which are two scenarios commonly encountered in real-world applications. These analyses further validate the robustness and adaptability of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yashwanthi Anand, Sandhya Saisubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from human feedback is a popular approach to train robots to adapt to user preferences and improve safety. Existing approaches typically consider a single querying (interaction) format when seeking human feedback and do not leverage multiple modes of user interaction with a robot. We examine how to learn a penalty function associated with unsafe behaviors, such as side effects, using multiple forms of human feedback, by optimizing the query state and feedback format. Our framework for adaptive feedback selection enables querying for feedback in critical states in the most informative format, while accounting for the cost and probability of receiving feedback in a certain format. We employ an iterative, two-phase approach which first selects critical states for querying, and then uses information gain to select a feedback format for querying across the sampled critical states. Our evaluation in simulation demonstrates the sample efficiency of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Xing, Nhat Chung, Jie Zhang, Yue Cao, Ivor Tsang, Yang Liu, Lei Ma, Qing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical adversarial attacks in driving scenarios can expose critical vulnerabilities in visual perception models. However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world backgrounds and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality. Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch-generation problem. Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments. The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate placement within the scene. We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges. MAGIC automatically understands scene context and orchestrates adversarial patch generation through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities. MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal placement strategies based on scene understanding. The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes. We validate our method on both digital and physical level, \ie, nuImage and manually captured real scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effectively for attacking wide-used object detection systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural language offers a convenient, flexible interface for controlling robotic C-arm X-ray systems, making advanced functionality and controls accessible. However, enabling language interfaces requires specialized AI models that interpret X-ray images to create a semantic representation for reasoning. The fixed outputs of such AI models limit the functionality of language controls. Incorporating flexible, language-aligned AI models prompted through language enables more versatile interfaces for diverse tasks and procedures. Using a language-aligned foundation model for X-ray image segmentation, our system continually updates a patient digital twin based on sparse reconstructions of desired anatomical structures. This supports autonomous capabilities such as visualization, patient-specific viewfinding, and automatic collimation from novel viewpoints, enabling commands 'Focus in on the lower lumbar vertebrae.' In a cadaver study, users visualized, localized, and collimated structures across the torso using verbal commands, achieving 84% end-to-end success. Post hoc analysis of randomly oriented images showed our patient digital twin could localize 35 commonly requested structures to within 51.68 mm, enabling localization and isolation from arbitrary orientations. Our results demonstrate how intelligent robotic X-ray systems can incorporate physicians' expressed intent directly. While existing foundation models for intra-operative X-ray analysis exhibit failure modes, as they improve, they can facilitate highly flexible, intelligent robotic C-arms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has the potential of lifting several of the key challenges in reinforcement learning today, such as exploration, representation learning, and reward design. Recent work (METRA) has effectively argued that moving away from mutual information and instead optimizing a certain Wasserstein distance is important for good performance. In this paper, we argue that the benefits seen in that paper can largely be explained within the existing framework of mutual information skill learning (MISL). Our analysis suggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the excellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights connections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and successor features. Finally, through careful ablation studies, we provide further insight into some of the key ingredients for both our method and METRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Qu, Hanxue Liang, Xiaoming Chen, Yuk Ying Chung, Yiran Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural View Synthesis (NVS) has demonstrated efficacy in generating high-fidelity dense viewpoint videos using a image set with sparse views. However, existing quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS are not tailored for the scenes with dense viewpoints synthesized by NVS and NeRF variants, thus, they often fall short in capturing the perceptual quality, including spatial and angular aspects of NVS-synthesized scenes. Furthermore, the lack of dense ground truth views makes the full reference quality assessment on NVS-synthesized scenes challenging. For instance, datasets such as LLFF provide only sparse images, insufficient for complete full-reference assessments. To address the issues above, we propose NeRF-NQA, the first no-reference quality assessment method for densely-observed scenes synthesized from the NVS and NeRF variants. NeRF-NQA employs a joint quality assessment strategy, integrating both viewwise and pointwise approaches, to evaluate the quality of NVS-generated scenes. The viewwise approach assesses the spatial quality of each individual synthesized view and the overall inter-views consistency, while the pointwise approach focuses on the angular qualities of scene surface points and their compound inter-point quality. Extensive evaluations are conducted to compare NeRF-NQA with 23 mainstream visual quality assessment methods (from fields of image, video, and light-field assessment). The results demonstrate NeRF-NQA outperforms the existing assessment methods significantly and it shows substantial superiority on assessing NVS-synthesized scenes without references.

<p>Abstract: Physical adversarial examples (PAEs) are regarded as "whistle-blowers" of real-world risks in deep-learning applications. However, current PAE generation studies show limited adaptive attacking ability to diverse and varying scenes. The key challenges in generating dynamic PAEs are exploring their patterns under noisy gradient feedback and adapting the attack to agnostic scenario natures. To address the problems, we present DynamicPAE, the first generative framework that enables scene-aware real-time physical attacks beyond static attacks. Specifically, to train the dynamic PAE generator under noisy gradient feedback, we introduce the residual-driven sample trajectory guidance technique, which redefines the training task to break the limited feedback information restriction that leads to the degeneracy problem. Intuitively, it allows the gradient feedback to be passed to the generator through a low-noise auxiliary task, thereby guiding the optimization away from degenerate solutions and facilitating a more comprehensive and stable exploration of feasible PAEs. To adapt the generator to agnostic scenario natures, we introduce the context-aligned scene expectation simulation process, consisting of the conditional-uncertainty-aligned data module and the skewness-aligned objective re-weighting module. The former enhances robustness in the context of incomplete observation by employing a conditional probabilistic model for domain randomization, while the latter facilitates consistent stealth control across different attack targets by automatically reweighting losses based on the skewness indicator. Extensive digital and physical evaluations demonstrate the superior attack performance of DynamicPAE, attaining a 1.95 $\times$ boost (65.55% average AP drop under attack) on representative object detectors (e.g., Yolo-v8) over state-of-the-art static PAE generating methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent services by enabling logical reasoning, tool use, and interaction with external systems as agents. The advancement of LLMs is frequently hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data, much of which is inherently sensitive. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by facilitating the collaborative training of distributed LLMs while safeguarding private data. However, FL frameworks face significant bandwidth and computational demands, along with challenges from heterogeneous data distributions. The emerging in-context learning capability of LLMs offers a promising approach by aggregating natural language rather than bulky model parameters. Yet, this method risks privacy leakage, as it necessitates the collection and presentation of data samples from various clients during aggregation. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning (FICAL) algorithm, which to our best knowledge for the first work unleashes the power of in-context learning to train diverse LLM agents through FL. In our design, knowledge compendiums generated by a novel LLM-enhanced Knowledge Compendiums Generation (KCG) module are transmitted between clients and the server instead of model parameters in previous FL methods. Apart from that, an incredible Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Tool Learning and Utilizing (TLU) module is designed and we incorporate the aggregated global knowledge compendium as a teacher to teach LLM agents the usage of tools. We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that FICAL has competitive performance compared to other SOTA baselines with a significant communication cost decrease of $\mathbf{3.33\times10^5}$ times.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Go programming language has gained significant traction for developing software, especially in various infrastructure systems. Nonetheless, concurrency bugs have become a prevalent issue within Go, presenting a unique challenge due to the language's dual concurrency mechanisms-communicating sequential processes and shared memory. Detecting concurrency bugs and accurately classifying program executions as pass or fail presents an immense challenge, even for domain experts. We conducted a survey with expert developers at Bytedance that confirmed this challenge. Our work seeks to address the test oracle problem for Go programs, to automatically classify test executions as pass or fail. This problem has not been investigated in the literature for Go programs owing to its distinctive programming model.
  Our approach involves collecting both passing and failing execution traces from various subject Go programs. We capture a comprehensive array of execution events using the native Go execution tracer. Subsequently, we preprocess and encode these traces before training a transformer-based neural network to effectively classify the traces as either passing or failing. The evaluation of our approach encompasses 8 subject programs sourced from the GoBench repository. These subject programs are routinely used as benchmarks in an industry setting. Encouragingly, our test oracle, Go-Oracle, demonstrates high accuracies even when operating with a limited dataset, showcasing the efficacy and potential of our methodology. Developers at Bytedance strongly agreed that they would use the Go-Oracle tool over the current practice of manual inspections to classify tests for Go programs as pass or fail.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code completion tasks, where they assist developers by predicting and generating new code in real-time. However, existing LLM-based code completion systems primarily rely on the immediate context of the file being edited, often missing valuable repository-level information, user behaviour and edit history that could improve suggestion accuracy. Additionally, challenges such as efficiently retrieving relevant code snippets from large repositories, incorporating user behavior, and balancing accuracy with low-latency requirements in production environments remain unresolved. In this paper, we propose ContextModule, a framework designed to enhance LLM-based code completion by retrieving and integrating three types of contextual information from the repository: user behavior-based code, similar code snippets, and critical symbol definitions. By capturing user interactions across files and leveraging repository-wide static analysis, ContextModule improves the relevance and precision of generated code. We implement performance optimizations, such as index caching, to ensure the system meets the latency constraints of real-world coding environments. Experimental results and industrial practise demonstrate that ContextModule significantly improves code completion accuracy and user acceptance rates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Software vendors often silently release security patches without providing sufficient advisories (e.g., Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) or delayed updates via resources (e.g., National Vulnerability Database). Therefore, it has become crucial to detect these security patches to ensure secure software maintenance. However, existing methods face the following challenges: (1) They primarily focus on the information within the patches themselves, overlooking the complex dependencies in the repository. (2) Security patches typically involve multiple functions and files, increasing the difficulty in well learning the representations. To alleviate the above challenges, this paper proposes a Repository-level Security Patch Detection framework named RepoSPD, which comprises three key components: 1) a repository-level graph construction, RepoCPG, which represents software patches by merging pre-patch and post-patch source code at the repository level; 2) a structure-aware patch representation, which fuses the graph and sequence branch and aims at comprehending the relationship among multiple code changes; 3) progressive learning, which facilitates the model in balancing semantic and structural information. To evaluate RepoSPD, we employ two widely-used datasets in security patch detection: SPI-DB and PatchDB. We further extend these datasets to the repository level, incorporating a total of 20,238 and 28,781 versions of repository in C/C++ programming languages, respectively, denoted as SPI-DB* and PatchDB*. We compare RepoSPD with six existing security patch detection methods and five static tools. Our experimental results demonstrate that RepoSPD outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, with improvements of 11.90%, and 3.10% in terms of accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyun Liang, Jingyi Ren, Jiayi Qi, Chao Peng, Bo Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly integral to enhancing developer productivity, particularly in code generation, comprehension, and repair tasks. However, fine-tuning these models with high-quality, real-world data is challenging due to privacy concerns and the lack of accessible, labeled datasets. In this paper, we present DialogAgent, an automated tool for generating synthetic training data that closely mimics real developer interactions within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). DialogAgent enables the production of diverse, high-fidelity query-response pairs by simulating multi-turn dialogues and contextual behaviors observed in real-world programming scenarios. The tool significantly reduces the reliance on manual data generation, increasing efficiency by 4.8 times compared to traditional methods. Our experiments and online deployment demonstrate substantial improvements in model performance for code-related question-answering tasks: the acceptance rate of responses generated by our in-house model is improved by 33%, after training on synthesized data generated by DialogAgent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinxin Zhang, Zhuoqun Xu, Guangpu Zhu, Chien Ming Jonathan Tay, Yongdong Cui, Boo Cheong Khoo, Lailai Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advanced large language models (LLMs) have showcased their emergent capability of in-context learning, facilitating intelligent decision-making through natural language prompts without retraining. This new machine learning paradigm has shown promise in various fields, including general control and optimization problems. Inspired by these advancements, we explore the potential of LLMs for a specific and essential engineering task: parametric shape optimization (PSO). We develop an optimization framework, LLM-PSO, that leverages an LLM to determine the optimal shape of parameterized engineering designs in the spirit of evolutionary strategies. Utilizing the ``Claude 3.5 Sonnet'' LLM, we evaluate LLM-PSO on two benchmark flow optimization problems, specifically aiming to identify drag-minimizing profiles for 1) a two-dimensional airfoil in laminar flow, and 2) a three-dimensional axisymmetric body in Stokes flow. In both cases, LLM-PSO successfully identifies optimal shapes in agreement with benchmark solutions. Besides, it generally converges faster than other classical optimization algorithms. Our preliminary exploration may inspire further investigations into harnessing LLMs for shape optimization and engineering design more broadly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Zhang, Kevin Kramer, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated segmentation of medical images highly depends on the availability of accurate manual image annotations. Such annotations are very time-consuming and costly to generate, and often require specialized expertise, particularly for cross-sectional images which contain many slices for each patient. It is crucial to ensure the best use of annotation resources. In this paper, we systematically answer the question of how to select slices of cross-sectional medical images in order to maximize performance of the resulting deep learning segmentation models. We conducted experiments on 4 medical imaging segmentation tasks with varying annotation budgets, numbers of annotated cases, numbers of annotated slices per volume, slice selection techniques, and mask interpolations. We found that:
  1) It is almost always preferable to annotate fewer slices per volume and more volumes given an annotation budget. 2) Selecting slices for annotation by unsupervised active learning (UAL) is not superior to selecting slices randomly or at fixed intervals, provided that each volume is allocated the same number of annotated slices. 3) Interpolating masks between annotated slices rarely enhances model performance, with exceptions of some specific configuration for 3D models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syrine Belakaria, Alaleh Ahmadianshalchi, Barbara Engelhardt, Stefano Ermon, Janardhan Rao Doppa</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of finite-horizon sequential experimental design to solve multi-objective optimization (MOO) of expensive black-box objective functions. This problem arises in many real-world applications, including materials design, where we have a small resource budget to make and evaluate candidate materials in the lab. We solve this problem using the framework of Bayesian optimization (BO) and propose the first set of non-myopic methods for MOO problems. Prior work on non-myopic BO for single-objective problems relies on the Bellman optimality principle to handle the lookahead reasoning process. However, this principle does not hold for most MOO problems because the reward function needs to satisfy some conditions: scalar variable, monotonicity, and additivity. We address this challenge by using hypervolume improvement (HVI) as our scalarization approach, which allows us to use a lower-bound on the Bellman equation to approximate the finite-horizon using a batch expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) acquisition function (AF) for MOO. Our formulation naturally allows us to use other improvement-based scalarizations and compare their efficacy to HVI. We derive three non-myopic AFs for MOBO: 1) the Nested AF, which is based on the exact computation of the lower bound, 2) the Joint AF, which is a lower bound on the nested AF, and 3) the BINOM AF, which is a fast and approximate variant based on batch multi-objective acquisition functions. Our experiments on multiple diverse real-world MO problems demonstrate that our non-myopic AFs substantially improve performance over the existing myopic AFs for MOBO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Bajpai, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: The unwavering disparity in labeled resources between resource-rich languages and those considered low-resource remains a significant impediment for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent strides in cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL), mainly through semantically aligned examples retrieved from multilingual pre-trained transformers, have shown promise in mitigating this issue. However, our investigation reveals that LLMs intrinsically reward in-language semantically aligned cross-lingual instances over direct cross-lingual semantic alignments, with a pronounced disparity in handling time-sensitive queries in the X-ICL setup. Such queries demand sound temporal reasoning ability from LLMs, yet the advancements have predominantly focused on English. This study aims to bridge this gap by improving temporal reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages. To this end, we introduce mTEMPREASON a temporal reasoning dataset aimed at the varied degrees of low-resource languages and propose Cross-Lingual Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment (CLiTSSA), a novel method to improve temporal reasoning in these contexts. To facilitate this, we construct an extension of mTEMPREASON comprising pairs of parallel cross-language temporal queries along with their anticipated in-language semantic similarity scores. Our empirical evidence underscores the superior performance of CLiTSSA compared to established baselines across three languages - Romanian, German, and French, encompassing three temporal tasks and including a diverse set of four contemporaneous LLMs. This marks a significant step forward in addressing resource disparity in the context of temporal reasoning across languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bangshuo Zhu, Jiawen Wen, Huaming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering domain, covering numerous tasks such as code generation and comprehension. While the benefit of LLMs for coding task is well noted, it is perceived that LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we study the specific LLM vulnerability to imperceptible character attacks, a type of prompt-injection attack that uses special characters to befuddle an LLM whilst keeping the attack hidden to human eyes. We devise four categories of attacks and investigate their effects on the performance outcomes of tasks relating to code analysis and code comprehension. Two generations of ChatGPT are included to evaluate the impact of advancements made to contemporary models. Our experimental design consisted of comparing perturbed and unperturbed code snippets and evaluating two performance outcomes, which are model confidence using log probabilities of response, and correctness of response. We conclude that earlier version of ChatGPT exhibits a strong negative linear correlation between the amount of perturbation and the performance outcomes, while the recent ChatGPT presents a strong negative correlation between the presence of perturbation and performance outcomes, but no valid correlational relationship between perturbation budget and performance outcomes. We anticipate this work contributes to an in-depth understanding of leveraging LLMs for coding tasks. It is suggested future research should delve into how to create LLMs that can return a correct response even if the prompt exhibits perturbations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in code generation tasks. However, there are still gaps before they can be fully applied in actual software development processes. Accurately assessing the code generation capabilities of large language models has become an important basis for evaluating and improving the models. Some existing works have constructed datasets to evaluate the capabilities of these models. However, the current evaluation process may encounter the illusion of "Specialist in Familiarity", primarily due to three gaps: the exposure of target code, case timeliness, and dependency availability. The fundamental reason for these gaps is that the code in current datasets may have been extensively exposed and exercised during the training phase, and due to the continuous training and development of LLM, their timeliness has been severely compromised. The key to solve the problem is to, as much as possible, evaluate the LLMs using code that they have not encountered before. Thus, the fundamental idea in this paper is to draw on the concept of code obfuscation, changing code at different levels while ensuring the functionality and output. To this end, we build a code-obfuscation based benchmark OBFUSEVAL. We first collect 1,354 raw cases from five real-world projects, including function description and code. Then we use three-level strategy (symbol, structure and semantic) to obfuscate descriptions, code and context dependencies. We evaluate four LLMs on OBFU- SEVAL and compared the effectiveness of different obfuscation strategy. We use official test suites of these projects to evaluate the generated code. The results show that after obfuscation, the average decrease ratio of test pass rate can up to 62.5%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) systems, such as FastSpeech and StyleSpeech, have significantly improved speech generation quality. However, these models often rely on duration generated by external tools like the Montreal Forced Aligner, which can be time-consuming and lack flexibility. The importance of accurate duration is often underestimated, despite their crucial role in achieving natural prosody and intelligibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Aligner-Guided Training Paradigm that prioritizes accurate duration labelling by training an aligner before the TTS model. This approach reduces dependence on external tools and enhances alignment accuracy. We further explore the impact of different acoustic features, including Mel-Spectrograms, MFCCs, and latent features, on TTS model performance. Our experimental results show that aligner-guided duration labelling can achieve up to a 16\% improvement in word error rate and significantly enhance phoneme and tone alignment. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our approach in optimizing TTS systems for more natural and intelligible speech generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based Generative AI gains significant attention for its superior performance over other generative techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders. While it has achieved notable advancements in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, their application in speech generation remains under-explored. Mainstream Text-to-Speech systems primarily map outputs to Mel-Spectrograms in the spectral space, leading to high computational loads due to the sparsity of MelSpecs. To address these limitations, we propose LatentSpeech, a novel TTS generation approach utilizing latent diffusion models. By using latent embeddings as the intermediate representation, LatentSpeech reduces the target dimension to 5% of what is required for MelSpecs, simplifying the processing for the TTS encoder and vocoder and enabling efficient high-quality speech generation. This study marks the first integration of latent diffusion models in TTS, enhancing the accuracy and naturalness of generated speech. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LatentSpeech achieves a 25% improvement in Word Error Rate and a 24% improvement in Mel Cepstral Distortion compared to existing models, with further improvements rising to 49.5% and 26%, respectively, with additional training data. These findings highlight the potential of LatentSpeech to advance the state-of-the-art in TTS technology</p>

In this method, a depth map is inferred from an ``event focal stack'' composed of the event stream using a convolutional neural network trained with synthesized event focal stacks. The synthesized event stream is created from a focal stack generated by Blender for any arbitrary 3D scene. This allows for training on scenes with diverse structures. Additionally, we explored methods to eliminate the domain gap between real event streams and synthetic event streams. Our method demonstrates superior performance over a depth-from-defocus method in the image domain on synthetic and real datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathana\"el Carraz Rakotonirina, Corentin Kervadec, Francesca Franzon, Marco Baroni</p>
<p>Abstract: It has been widely observed that language models (LMs) respond in predictable ways to algorithmically generated prompts that are seemingly unintelligible. This is both a sign that we lack a full understanding of how LMs work, and a practical challenge, because opaqueness can be exploited for harmful uses of LMs, such as jailbreaking. We present the first thorough analysis of opaque machine-generated prompts, or autoprompts, pertaining to 3 LMs of different sizes and families. We find that machine-generated prompts are characterized by a last token that is often intelligible and strongly affects the generation. A small but consistent proportion of the previous tokens are fillers that probably appear in the prompt as a by-product of the fact that the optimization process fixes the number of tokens. The remaining tokens tend to have at least a loose semantic relation with the generation, although they do not engage in well-formed syntactic relations with it. We find moreover that some of the ablations we applied to machine-generated prompts can also be applied to natural language sequences, leading to similar behavior, suggesting that autoprompts are a direct consequence of the way in which LMs process linguistic inputs in general.</p>

<p>Abstract: Raman spectroscopy has attracted significant attention in various biochemical detection fields, especially in the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria. The integration of this technology with deep learning to facilitate automated bacterial Raman spectroscopy diagnosis has emerged as a key focus in recent research. However, the diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods largely depends on a sufficient dataset, and in scenarios where there is a limited availability of Raman spectroscopy data, it is inadequate to fully optimize the numerous parameters of deep neural networks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data generation method utilizing deep generative models to expand the data volume and enhance the recognition accuracy of bacterial Raman spectra. Specifically, we introduce DiffRaman, a conditional latent denoising diffusion probability model for Raman spectra generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic bacterial Raman spectra generated by DiffRaman can effectively emulate real experimental spectra, thereby enhancing the performance of diagnostic models, especially under conditions of limited data. Furthermore, compared to existing generative models, the proposed DiffRaman offers improvements in both generation quality and computational efficiency. Our DiffRaman approach offers a well-suited solution for automated bacteria Raman spectroscopy diagnosis in data-scarce scenarios, offering new insights into alleviating the labor of spectroscopic measurements and enhancing rare bacteria identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchang Sun, Xinran Li, Tao Lin, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning among decentralized clients while safeguarding the privacy of their local data. Existing studies on FL typically assume offline labeled data available at each client when the training starts. Nevertheless, the training data in practice often arrive at clients in a streaming fashion without ground-truth labels. Given the expensive annotation cost, it is critical to identify a subset of informative samples for labeling on clients. However, selecting samples locally while accommodating the global training objective presents a challenge unique to FL. In this work, we tackle this conundrum by framing the data querying process in FL as a collaborative decentralized decision-making problem and proposing an effective solution named LeaDQ, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. In particular, under the implicit guidance from global information, LeaDQ effectively learns the local policies for distributed clients and steers them towards selecting samples that can enhance the global model's accuracy. Extensive simulations on image and text tasks show that LeaDQ advances the model performance in various FL scenarios, outperforming the benchmarking algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Lv, Haoyuan Yang, Peihua Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Since pioneering work of Hinton et al., knowledge distillation based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Div) has been predominant, and recently its variants have achieved compelling performance. However, KL-Div only compares probabilities of the corresponding category between the teacher and student while lacking a mechanism for cross-category comparison. Besides, KL-Div is problematic when applied to intermediate layers, as it cannot handle non-overlapping distributions and is unaware of geometry of the underlying manifold. To address these downsides, we propose a methodology of Wasserstein Distance (WD) based knowledge distillation. Specifically, we propose a logit distillation method called WKD-L based on discrete WD, which performs cross-category comparison of probabilities and thus can explicitly leverage rich interrelations among categories. Moreover, we introduce a feature distillation method called WKD-F, which uses a parametric method for modeling feature distributions and adopts continuous WD for transferring knowledge from intermediate layers. Comprehensive evaluations on image classification and object detection have shown (1) for logit distillation WKD-L outperforms very strong KL-Div variants; (2) for feature distillation WKD-F is superior to the KL-Div counterparts and state-of-the-art competitors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weigang Lu, Ziyu Guan, Wei Zhao, Yaming Yang, Yibing Zhan, Yiheng Lu, Dapeng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixup is a data augmentation technique that enhances model generalization by interpolating between data points using a mixing ratio $\lambda$ in the image domain. Recently, the concept of mixup has been adapted to the graph domain through node-centric interpolations. However, these approaches often fail to address the complexity of interconnected relationships, potentially damaging the graph's natural topology and undermining node interactions. Furthermore, current graph mixup methods employ a one-size-fits-all strategy with a randomly sampled $\lambda$ for all mixup pairs, ignoring the diverse needs of different pairs. This paper proposes an Adaptive Graph Mixup (AGMixup) framework for semi-supervised node classification. AGMixup introduces a subgraph-centric approach, which treats each subgraph similarly to how images are handled in Euclidean domains, thus facilitating a more natural integration of mixup into graph-based learning. We also propose an adaptive mechanism to tune the mixing ratio $\lambda$ for diverse mixup pairs, guided by the contextual similarity and uncertainty of the involved subgraphs. Extensive experiments across seven datasets on semi-supervised node classification benchmarks demonstrate AGMixup's superiority over state-of-the-art graph mixup methods.

<p>Abstract: When finetuning multiple tasks altogether, it is important to carefully weigh them to get a good performance, but searching for good weights can be difficult and costly. Here, we propose to aid the search with fast previews to quickly get a rough idea of different reweighting options. We use model merging to create previews by simply reusing and averaging parameters of models trained on each task separately (no retraining required). To improve the quality of previews, we propose a Bayesian approach to design new merging strategies by using more flexible posteriors. We validate our findings on vision and natural-language transformers. Our work shows the benefits of model merging via Bayes to improve multitask finetuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guiran Liu, Binrong Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of mechanical equipment fault diagnosis methods, focusing on the advancements brought by Transformer-based models. It details the structure, working principles, and benefits of Transformers, particularly their self-attention mechanism and parallel computation capabilities, which have propelled their widespread application in natural language processing and computer vision. The discussion highlights key Transformer model variants, such as Vision Transformers (ViT) and their extensions, which leverage self-attention to improve accuracy and efficiency in visual tasks. Furthermore, the paper examines the application of Transformer-based approaches in intelligent fault diagnosis for mechanical systems, showcasing their superior ability to extract and recognize patterns from complex sensor data for precise fault identification. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, significant computational demands, and difficulties in deploying models on resource-limited devices. To address these limitations, the paper proposes future research directions, such as developing lightweight Transformer architectures, integrating multimodal data sources, and enhancing adaptability to diverse operational conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhao, Xiaojun Chen, Haoyu Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the remarkable generative potential of diffusion-based models, numerous researches have investigated jailbreak attacks targeting these frameworks. A particularly concerning threat within image models is the generation of Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content. Despite the implementation of security filters, numerous efforts continue to explore ways to circumvent these safeguards. Current attack methodologies primarily encompass adversarial prompt engineering or concept obfuscation, yet they frequently suffer from slow search efficiency, conspicuous attack characteristics and poor alignment with targets. To overcome these challenges, we propose Antelope, a more robust and covert jailbreak attack strategy designed to expose security vulnerabilities inherent in generative models. Specifically, Antelope leverages the confusion of sensitive concepts with similar ones, facilitates searches in the semantically adjacent space of these related concepts and aligns them with the target imagery, thereby generating sensitive images that are consistent with the target and capable of evading detection. Besides, we successfully exploit the transferability of model-based attacks to penetrate online black-box services. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Antelope outperforms existing baselines across multiple defensive mechanisms, underscoring its efficacy and versatility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Li, Lecheng Zheng, Bowen Jin, Dongqi Fu, Baoyu Jing, Yikun Ban, Jingrui He, Jiawei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: While great success has been achieved in building vision models with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) over Internet-scale image-text pairs, building transferable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with CLIP pipeline is challenging because of three fundamental issues: the scarcity of labeled data and text supervision, different levels of downstream tasks, and the conceptual gaps between domains. In this work, to address these issues, we leverage multi-modal prompt learning to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. To accomplish this, we improve state-of-the-art graph prompt method, and then propose the first graph-language multi-modal prompt learning approach for exploiting the knowledge in pre-trained models. Notably, due to the insufficient supervision for fine-tuning, in our paradigm, the pre-trained GNN and the LLM are kept frozen, so the learnable parameters are much fewer than fine-tuning any pre-trained model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Van-Duc Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial analysis heavily relies on the evaluation of earnings reports to gain insights into company performance. Traditional generation of these reports requires extensive financial expertise and is time-consuming. With the impressive progress in Large Language Models (LLMs), a wide variety of financially focused LLMs has emerged, addressing tasks like sentiment analysis and entity recognition in the financial domain. This paper presents a novel challenge: developing an LLM specifically for automating the generation of earnings reports analysis. Our methodology involves an in-depth analysis of existing earnings reports followed by a unique approach to fine-tune an LLM for this purpose. This approach combines retrieval augmentation and the generation of instruction-based data, specifically tailored for the financial sector, to enhance the LLM's performance. With extensive financial documents, we construct financial instruction data, enabling the refined adaptation of our LLM to financial contexts. Preliminary results indicate that our augmented LLM outperforms general open-source models and rivals commercial counterparts like GPT-3.5 in financial applications. Our research paves the way for streamlined and insightful automation in financial report generation, marking a significant stride in the field of financial analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dinesh Parthasarathy, Tommaso Bevilacqua, Martin Lanser, Axel Klawonn, Harald K\"ostler</p>
<p>Abstract: Multigrid methods are asymptotically optimal algorithms ideal for large-scale simulations. But, they require making numerous algorithmic choices that significantly influence their efficiency. Unlike recent approaches that learn optimal multigrid components using machine learning techniques, we adopt a complementary strategy here, employing evolutionary algorithms to construct efficient multigrid cycles from available individual components. This technology is applied to finite element simulations of the laser beam welding process. The thermo-elastic behavior is described by a coupled system of time-dependent thermo-elasticity equations, leading to nonlinear and ill-conditioned systems. The nonlinearity is addressed using Newton's method, and iterative solvers are accelerated with an algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner using hypre BoomerAMG interfaced via PETSc. This is applied as a monolithic solver for the coupled equations. To further enhance solver efficiency, flexible AMG cycles are introduced, extending traditional cycle types with level-specific smoothing sequences and non-recursive cycling patterns. These are automatically generated using genetic programming, guided by a context-free grammar containing AMG rules. Numerical experiments demonstrate the potential of these approaches to improve solver performance in large-scale laser beam welding simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thibault Prouteau, Nicolas Dugu\'e, Simon Guillot</p>
<p>Abstract: Modelling information from complex systems such as humans social interaction or words co-occurrences in our languages can help to understand how these systems are organized and function. Such systems can be modelled by networks, and network theory provides a useful set of methods to analyze them. Among these methods, graph embedding is a powerful tool to summarize the interactions and topology of a network in a vectorized feature space. When used in input of machine learning algorithms, embedding vectors help with common graph problems such as link prediction, graph matching, etc. Word embedding has the goal of representing the sense of words, extracting it from large text corpora. Despite differences in the structure of information in input of embedding algorithms, many graph embedding approaches are adapted and inspired from methods in NLP. Limits of these methods are observed in both domains. Most of these methods require long and resource greedy training. Another downside to most methods is that they are black-box, from which understanding how the information is structured is rather complex. Interpretability of a model allows understanding how the vector space is structured without the need for external information, and thus can be audited more easily. With both these limitations in mind, we propose a novel framework to efficiently embed network vertices in an interpretable vector space. Our Lower Dimension Bipartite Framework (LDBGF) leverages the bipartite projection of a network using cliques to reduce dimensionality. Along with LDBGF, we introduce two implementations of this framework that rely on communities instead of cliques: SINr-NR and SINr-MF. We show that SINr-MF can perform well on classical graphs and SINr-NR can produce high-quality graph and word embeddings that are interpretable and stable across runs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitong Chen, Chao Sun, Shida Nie, Chen Min, Changjiu Ning, Haoyu Li, Bo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Off-road environments present significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles due to the absence of structured roads and the presence of complex obstacles, such as uneven terrain, vegetation, and occlusions. Traditional perception algorithms, designed primarily for structured environments, often fail under these conditions, leading to inaccurate traversability estimations. In this paper, ORDformer, a novel multimodal method that combines LiDAR point clouds with monocular images, is proposed to generate dense traversable occupancy predictions from a forward-facing perspective. By integrating multimodal data, environmental feature extraction is enhanced, which is crucial for accurate occupancy estimation in complex terrains. Furthermore, RELLIS-OCC, a dataset with 3D traversable occupancy annotations, is introduced, incorporating geometric features such as step height, slope, and unevenness. Through a comprehensive analysis of vehicle obstacle-crossing conditions and the incorporation of vehicle body structure constraints, four traversability cost labels are generated: lethal, medium-cost, low-cost, and free. Experimental results demonstrate that ORDformer outperforms existing approaches in 3D traversable area recognition, particularly in off-road environments with irregular geometries and partial occlusions. Specifically, ORDformer achieves over a 20\% improvement in scene completion IoU compared to other models. The proposed framework is scalable and adaptable to various vehicle platforms, allowing for adjustments to occupancy grid parameters and the integration of advanced dynamic models for traversability cost estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most techniques approach the problem of image forgery localization as a binary segmentation task, training neural networks to label original areas as 0 and forged areas as 1. In contrast, we tackle this issue from a more fundamental perspective by partitioning images according to their originating sources. To this end, we propose Segment Any Forged Image Region (SAFIRE), which solves forgery localization using point prompting. Each point on an image is used to segment the source region containing itself. This allows us to partition images into multiple source regions, a capability achieved for the first time. Additionally, rather than memorizing certain forgery traces, SAFIRE naturally focuses on uniform characteristics within each source region. This approach leads to more stable and effective learning, achieving superior performance in both the new task and the traditional binary forgery localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Gao, Weikai Huang, Jieyu Zhang, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: DALL-E and Sora have gained attention by producing implausible images, such as "astronauts riding a horse in space." Despite the proliferation of text-to-vision models that have inundated the internet with synthetic visuals, from images to 3D assets, current benchmarks predominantly evaluate these models on real-world scenes paired with captions. We introduce Generate Any Scene, a framework that systematically enumerates scene graphs representing a vast array of visual scenes, spanning realistic to imaginative compositions. Generate Any Scene leverages 'scene graph programming', a method for dynamically constructing scene graphs of varying complexity from a structured taxonomy of visual elements. This taxonomy includes numerous objects, attributes, and relations, enabling the synthesis of an almost infinite variety of scene graphs. Using these structured representations, Generate Any Scene translates each scene graph into a caption, enabling scalable evaluation of text-to-vision models through standard metrics. We conduct extensive evaluations across multiple text-to-image, text-to-video, and text-to-3D models, presenting key findings on model performance. We find that DiT-backbone text-to-image models align more closely with input captions than UNet-backbone models. Text-to-video models struggle with balancing dynamics and consistency, while both text-to-video and text-to-3D models show notable gaps in human preference alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Generate Any Scene by conducting three practical applications leveraging captions generated by Generate Any Scene: 1) a self-improving framework where models iteratively enhance their performance using generated data, 2) a distillation process to transfer specific strengths from proprietary models to open-source counterparts, and 3) improvements in content moderation by identifying and generating challenging synthetic data.</p>

To address this limitation, we propose to annotate benthic images using hierarchical classification. Experiments on a custom dataset from a Northeast Brazilian coral reef show that our approach outperforms flat classifiers, improving both F1 and hierarchical F1 scores by approximately 2\% across varying amounts of training data. In addition, this hierarchical method aligns more closely with ecological objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Yang, Weipeng Hu, Haifeng Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) offers a more flexible and cost-effective alternative compared to supervised methods. This field has gained increasing attention due to its promising potential. Existing methods simply cluster modality-specific samples and employ strong association techniques to achieve instance-to-cluster or cluster-to-cluster cross-modality associations. However, they ignore cross-camera differences, leading to noticeable issues with excessive splitting of identities. Consequently, this undermines the accuracy and reliability of cross-modal associations. To address these issues, we propose a novel Dynamic Modality-Camera Invariant Clustering (DMIC) framework for USL-VI-ReID. Specifically, our DMIC naturally integrates Modality-Camera Invariant Expansion (MIE), Dynamic Neighborhood Clustering (DNC) and Hybrid Modality Contrastive Learning (HMCL) into a unified framework, which eliminates both the cross-modality and cross-camera discrepancies in clustering. MIE fuses inter-modal and inter-camera distance coding to bridge the gaps between modalities and cameras at the clustering level. DNC employs two dynamic search strategies to refine the network's optimization objective, transitioning from improving discriminability to enhancing cross-modal and cross-camera generalizability. Moreover, HMCL is designed to optimize instance-level and cluster-level distributions. Memories for intra-modality and inter-modality training are updated using randomly selected samples, facilitating real-time exploration of modality-invariant representations. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our DMIC addresses the limitations present in current clustering approaches and achieve competitive performance, which significantly reduces the performance gap with supervised methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ontologies of research topics are crucial for structuring scientific knowledge, enabling scientists to navigate vast amounts of research, and forming the backbone of intelligent systems such as search engines and recommendation systems. However, manual creation of these ontologies is expensive, slow, and often results in outdated and overly general representations. As a solution, researchers have been investigating ways to automate or semi-automate the process of generating these ontologies. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships between different research topics, which is a critical step in the development of such ontologies. To this end, we developed a gold standard based on the IEEE Thesaurus to evaluate the task of identifying four types of relationships between pairs of topics: broader, narrower, same-as, and other. Our study evaluates the performance of seventeen LLMs, which differ in scale, accessibility (open vs. proprietary), and model type (full vs. quantised), while also assessing four zero-shot reasoning strategies. Several models have achieved outstanding results, including Mixtral-8x7B, Dolphin-Mistral-7B, and Claude 3 Sonnet, with F1-scores of 0.847, 0.920, and 0.967, respectively. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that smaller, quantised models, when optimised through prompt engineering, can deliver performance comparable to much larger proprietary models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: We aim to develop a model-based planning framework for world models that can be scaled with increasing model and data budgets for general-purpose manipulation tasks with only language and vision inputs. To this end, we present FLow-centric generative Planning (FLIP), a model-based planning algorithm on visual space that features three key modules: 1. a multi-modal flow generation model as the general-purpose action proposal module; 2. a flow-conditioned video generation model as the dynamics module; and 3. a vision-language representation learning model as the value module. Given an initial image and language instruction as the goal, FLIP can progressively search for long-horizon flow and video plans that maximize the discounted return to accomplish the task. FLIP is able to synthesize long-horizon plans across objects, robots, and tasks with image flows as the general action representation, and the dense flow information also provides rich guidance for long-horizon video generation. In addition, the synthesized flow and video plans can guide the training of low-level control policies for robot execution. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FLIP can improve both the success rates and quality of long-horizon video plan synthesis and has the interactive world model property, opening up wider applications for future works.</p>

<p>Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover partial geometric and topological shapes caused by equipment defects or limited viewpoints. Current methods either solely rely on the 3D coordinates of the point cloud to complete it or incorporate additional images with well-calibrated intrinsic parameters to guide the geometric estimation of the missing parts. Although these methods have achieved excellent performance by directly predicting the location of complete points, the extracted features lack fine-grained information regarding the location of the missing area. To address this issue, we propose a rapid and efficient method to expand an unimodal framework into a multimodal framework. This approach incorporates a position-aware module designed to enhance the spatial information of the missing parts through a weighted map learning mechanism. In addition, we establish a Point-Text-Image triplet corpus PCI-TI and MVP-TI based on the existing unimodal point cloud completion dataset and use the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP to provide richer detail information for 3D shapes, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjun Ding, Ying An, Lixing Chen, Shichao Kan, Fan Wu, Zhe Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Adversarial Learning (FAL) is a robust framework for resisting adversarial attacks on federated learning. Although some FAL studies have developed efficient algorithms, they primarily focus on convergence performance and overlook generalization. Generalization is crucial for evaluating algorithm performance on unseen data. However, generalization analysis is more challenging due to non-smooth adversarial loss functions. A common approach to addressing this issue is to leverage smoothness approximation. In this paper, we develop algorithm stability measures to evaluate the generalization performance of two popular FAL algorithms: \textit{Vanilla FAL (VFAL)} and {\it Slack FAL (SFAL)}, using three different smooth approximation methods: 1) \textit{Surrogate Smoothness Approximation (SSA)}, (2) \textit{Randomized Smoothness Approximation (RSA)}, and (3) \textit{Over-Parameterized Smoothness Approximation (OPSA)}. Based on our in-depth analysis, we answer the question of how to properly set the smoothness approximation method to mitigate generalization error in FAL. Moreover, we identify RSA as the most effective method for reducing generalization error. In highly data-heterogeneous scenarios, we also recommend employing SFAL to mitigate the deterioration of generalization performance caused by heterogeneity. Based on our theoretical results, we provide insights to help develop more efficient FAL algorithms, such as designing new metrics and dynamic aggregation rules to mitigate heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikil Roashan Selvam, Amil Merchant, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: In diffusion models, samples are generated through an iterative refinement process, requiring hundreds of sequential model evaluations. Several recent methods have introduced approximations (fewer discretization steps or distillation) to trade off speed at the cost of sample quality. In contrast, we introduce Self-Refining Diffusion Samplers (SRDS) that retain sample quality and can improve latency at the cost of additional parallel compute. We take inspiration from the Parareal algorithm, a popular numerical method for parallel-in-time integration of differential equations. In SRDS, a quick but rough estimate of a sample is first created and then iteratively refined in parallel through Parareal iterations. SRDS is not only guaranteed to accurately solve the ODE and converge to the serial solution but also benefits from parallelization across the diffusion trajectory, enabling batched inference and pipelining. As we demonstrate for pre-trained diffusion models, the early convergence of this refinement procedure drastically reduces the number of steps required to produce a sample, speeding up generation for instance by up to 1.7x on a 25-step StableDiffusion-v2 benchmark and up to 4.3x on longer trajectories.</p>

Through comprehensive empirical analysis using a 135M parameter model, we demonstrate that the relationship between learning rate and batch size significantly impacts model performance in a task-dependent manner. Our findings reveal a clear split: reasoning tasks like ARC and GSM8K benefit from higher learning rate to batch size ratios, while pattern recognition tasks such as HellaSwag and IFEval show optimal performance with lower ratios. These insights informed the development of SmolTulu, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among sub-2B parameter models on instruction following, scoring 67.7% on IFEval ($\Delta$11%), and mathematical reasoning with 51.6% on GSM8K ($\Delta$3.4%), with an alternate version achieving scoring 57.1% on ARC ($\Delta5.4%$). We release our model, training recipes, and ablation studies to facilitate further research in efficient model alignment, demonstrating that careful adaptation of optimization dynamics can help bridge the capability gap between small and large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiding Zhu, Wenhui Dong, Jun Song, Yanan Guo, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to process high-resolution images. A common approach currently involves dynamically cropping the original high-resolution image into smaller sub-images, which are then fed into a vision encoder that was pre-trained on lower-resolution images. However, this cropping approach often truncates objects and connected areas in the original image, causing semantic breaks. To address this limitation, we introduce HyViLM, designed to process images of any resolution while retaining the overall context during encoding. Specifically, we: (i) Design a new visual encoder called Hybrid Encoder that not only encodes individual sub-images but also interacts with detailed global visual features, significantly improving the model's ability to encode high-resolution images. (ii) Propose an optimal feature fusion strategy for the dynamic cropping approach, effectively leveraging information from different layers of the vision encoder. Compared with the state-of-the-art MLLMs under the same setting, our HyViLM outperforms existing MLLMs in nine out of ten tasks. Specifically, HyViLM achieves a 9.6% improvement in performance on the TextVQA task and a 6.9% enhancement on the DocVQA task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Kumar Nigam, Balaramamahanthi Deepak Patnaik, Shivam Mishra, Noel Shallum, Kripabandhu Ghosh, Arnab Bhattacharya</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in legal judgment prediction (LJP) has the potential to transform the legal landscape, particularly in jurisdictions like India, where a significant backlog of cases burdens the legal system. This paper introduces NyayaAnumana, the largest and most diverse corpus of Indian legal cases compiled for LJP, encompassing a total of 7,02,945 preprocessed cases. NyayaAnumana, which combines the words "Nyay" (judgment) and "Anuman" (prediction or inference) respectively for most major Indian languages, includes a wide range of cases from the Supreme Court, High Courts, Tribunal Courts, District Courts, and Daily Orders and, thus, provides unparalleled diversity and coverage. Our dataset surpasses existing datasets like PredEx and ILDC, offering a comprehensive foundation for advanced AI research in the legal domain.
  In addition to the dataset, we present INLegalLlama, a domain-specific generative large language model (LLM) tailored to the intricacies of the Indian legal system. It is developed through a two-phase training approach over a base LLaMa model. First, Indian legal documents are injected using continual pretraining. Second, task-specific supervised finetuning is done. This method allows the model to achieve a deeper understanding of legal contexts.
  Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating diverse court data significantly boosts model accuracy, achieving approximately 90% F1-score in prediction tasks. INLegalLlama not only improves prediction accuracy but also offers comprehensible explanations, addressing the need for explainability in AI-assisted legal decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wessel Poelman, Miryam de Lhoneux</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual natural language processing is getting increased attention, with numerous models, benchmarks, and methods being released for many languages. English is often used in multilingual evaluation to prompt language models (LMs), mainly to overcome the lack of instruction tuning data in other languages. In this position paper, we lay out two roles of English in multilingual LM evaluations: as an interface and as a natural language. We argue that these roles have different goals: task performance versus language understanding. This discrepancy is highlighted with examples from datasets and evaluation setups. Numerous works explicitly use English as an interface to boost task performance. We recommend to move away from this imprecise method and instead focus on furthering language understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedant Vyas, Martin Schuck, Dinushka O. Dahanaggamaarachchi, Siqi Zhou, Angela P. Schoellig</p>
<p>Abstract: Catalyzed by advancements in hardware and software, drone performances are increasingly making their mark in the entertainment industry. However, designing smooth and safe choreographies for drone swarms is complex and often requires expert domain knowledge. In this work, we introduce SwarmGPT-Primitive, a language-based choreographer that integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with safe motion planning to facilitate deployable drone swarm choreographies. The LLM composes choreographies for a given piece of music by utilizing a library of motion primitives; the language-based choreographer is augmented with an optimization-based safety filter, which certifies the choreography for real-world deployment by making minimal adjustments when feasibility and safety constraints are violated. The overall SwarmGPT-Primitive framework decouples choreographic design from safe motion planning, which allows non-expert users to re-prompt and refine compositions without concerns about compliance with constraints such as avoiding collisions or downwash effects or satisfying actuation limits. We demonstrate our approach through simulations and experiments with swarms of up to 20 drones performing choreographies designed based on various songs, highlighting the system's ability to generate effective and synchronized drone choreographies for real-world deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guochao Jiang, Ziqin Luo, Chengwei Hu, Zepeng Ding, Deqing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Many previous models of named entity recognition (NER) suffer from the problem of Out-of-Entity (OOE), i.e., the tokens in the entity mentions of the test samples have not appeared in the training samples, which hinders the achievement of satisfactory performance. To improve OOE-NER performance, in this paper, we propose a new framework, namely S+NER, which fully leverages sentence-level information. Our S+NER achieves better OOE-NER performance mainly due to the following two particular designs. 1) It first exploits the pre-trained language model's capability of understanding the target entity's sentence-level context with a template set. 2) Then, it refines the sentence-level representation based on the positive and negative templates, through a contrastive learning strategy and template pooling method, to obtain better NER results. Our extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have demonstrated that, our S+NER outperforms some state-of-the-art OOE-NER models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lifan Zhao, Yanyan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present \textsc{Proceed}, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. \textsc{Proceed} first operates by estimating the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, \textsc{Proceed} is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models. The empirical study demonstrates that our proposed \textsc{Proceed} brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fermin Orozco, Pedro Porto Buarque de Gusm\~ao, Hongkai Wen, Johan Wahlstr\"om, Man Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep-learning based traffic prediction models require vast amounts of data to learn embedded spatial and temporal dependencies. The inherent privacy and commercial sensitivity of such data has encouraged a shift towards decentralised data-driven methods, such as Federated Learning (FL). Under a traditional Machine Learning paradigm, traffic flow prediction models can capture spatial and temporal relationships within centralised data. In reality, traffic data is likely distributed across separate data silos owned by multiple stakeholders. In this work, a cross-silo FL setting is motivated to facilitate stakeholder collaboration for optimal traffic flow prediction applications. This work introduces an FL framework, referred to as FedTPS, to generate synthetic data to augment each client's local dataset by training a diffusion-based trajectory generation model through FL. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large-scale real world ride-sharing dataset using various FL methods and Traffic Flow Prediction models, including a novel prediction model we introduce, which leverages Temporal and Graph Attention mechanisms to learn the Spatio-Temporal dependencies embedded within regional traffic flow data. Experimental results show that FedTPS outperforms multiple other FL baselines with respect to global model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gauri Jain, Pradeep Varakantham, Haifeng Xu, Aparna Taneja, Prashant Doshi, Milind Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: Public health practitioners often have the goal of monitoring patients and maximizing patients' time spent in "favorable" or healthy states while being constrained to using limited resources. Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) are an effective model to solve this problem as they are helpful to allocate limited resources among many agents under resource constraints, where patients behave differently depending on whether they are intervened on or not. However, RMABs assume the reward function is known. This is unrealistic in many public health settings because patients face unique challenges and it is impossible for a human to know who is most deserving of any intervention at such a large scale. To address this shortcoming, this paper is the first to present the use of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to learn desired rewards for RMABs, and we demonstrate improved outcomes in a maternal and child health telehealth program. First we allow public health experts to specify their goals at an aggregate or population level and propose an algorithm to design expert trajectories at scale based on those goals. Second, our algorithm WHIRL uses gradient updates to optimize the objective, allowing for efficient and accurate learning of RMAB rewards. Third, we compare with existing baselines and outperform those in terms of run-time and accuracy. Finally, we evaluate and show the usefulness of WHIRL on thousands on beneficiaries from a real-world maternal and child health setting in India. We publicly release our code here: https://github.com/Gjain234/WHIRL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zun Wang, Jialu Li, Yicong Hong, Songze Li, Kunchang Li, Shoubin Yu, Yi Wang, Yu Qiao, Yali Wang, Mohit Bansal, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating high-quality data for training robust language-instructed agents is a long-lasting challenge in embodied AI. In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Rafi Hasan, Niloy Kumar Kundu, Saad Hasan, Mohammad Rashedul Hoque, Swakkhar Shatabda</p>
<p>Abstract: The Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) method is a rice-growing water management technique promoted as a sustainable alternative to Continuous Flooding (CF). Climate change has placed the agricultural sector in a challenging position, particularly as global water resources become increasingly scarce, affecting rice production on irrigated lowlands. Rice, a staple food for over half of the world's population, demands significantly more water than other major crops. In Bangladesh, \textit{Boro} rice, in particular, requires considerable water inputs during its cultivation. Traditionally, farmers manually measure water levels, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. While ultrasonic sensors offer improvements in water height measurement, they still face limitations, such as susceptibility to weather conditions and environmental factors. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that automates water height measurement using computer vision, specifically through a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our attention-based architecture achieved an $R^2$ score of 0.9885 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.2766, providing a more accurate and efficient solution for managing AWD systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Currently, data-intensive scientific applications require vast amounts of compute resources to deliver world-leading science. The climate emergency has made it clear that unlimited use of resources (e.g., energy) for scientific discovery is no longer acceptable. Future computing hardware promises to be much more energy efficient, but without better optimized software this cannot reach its full potential. In this vision paper, we propose a generic AI-driven co-design methodology, using specialized Large Language Models (like ChatGPT), to effectively generate efficient code for emerging computing hardware. We describe how we will validate our methodology with two radio astronomy applications, with sustainability as the key performance indicator. This paper is a modified version of our accepted SuperCode project proposal. We present it here in this form to introduce the vision behind this project and to disseminate the work in the spirit of Open Science and transparency. An additional aim is to collect feedback, invite potential collaboration partners and use-cases to join the project.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Xie, Tao Feng, Xin Zhang, Xiangyang Luo, Zixuan Guo, Weijiang Yu, Heng Chang, Fei Ma, Fei Richard Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Talking head synthesis with arbitrary speech audio is a crucial challenge in the field of digital humans. Recently, methods based on radiance fields have received increasing attention due to their ability to synthesize high-fidelity and identity-consistent talking heads from just a few minutes of training video. However, due to the limited scale of the training data, these methods often exhibit poor performance in audio-lip synchronization and visual quality. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian-based method called PointTalk, which constructs a static 3D Gaussian field of the head and deforms it in sync with the audio. It also incorporates an audio-driven dynamic lip point cloud as a critical component of the conditional information, thereby facilitating the effective synthesis of talking heads. Specifically, the initial step involves generating the corresponding lip point cloud from the audio signal and capturing its topological structure. The design of the dynamic difference encoder aims to capture the subtle nuances inherent in dynamic lip movements more effectively. Furthermore, we integrate the audio-point enhancement module, which not only ensures the synchronization of the audio signal with the corresponding lip point cloud within the feature space, but also facilitates a deeper understanding of the interrelations among cross-modal conditional features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking head synthesis compared to previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristoffer K. Wickstr{\o}m, Thea Br\"usch, Michael C. Kampffmeyer, Robert Jenssen</p>
<p>Abstract: Incorporating uncertainty is crucial to provide trustworthy explanations of deep learning models. Recent works have demonstrated how uncertainty modeling can be particularly important in the unsupervised field of representation learning explainable artificial intelligence (R-XAI). Current R-XAI methods provide uncertainty by measuring variability in the importance score. However, they fail to provide meaningful estimates of whether a pixel is certainly important or not. In this work, we propose a new R-XAI method called REPEAT that addresses the key question of whether or not a pixel is \textit{certainly} important. REPEAT leverages the stochasticity of current R-XAI methods to produce multiple estimates of importance, thus considering each pixel in an image as a Bernoulli random variable that is either important or unimportant. From these Bernoulli random variables we can directly estimate the importance of a pixel and its associated certainty, thus enabling users to determine certainty in pixel importance. Our extensive evaluation shows that REPEAT gives certainty estimates that are more intuitive, better at detecting out-of-distribution data, and more concise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Geissler, Bo Zhou, Mengxi Liu, Paul Lukowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised machine learning often operates on the data-driven paradigm, wherein internal model parameters are autonomously optimized to converge predicted outputs with the ground truth, devoid of explicitly programming rules or a priori assumptions. Although data-driven methods have yielded notable successes across various benchmark datasets, they inherently treat models as opaque entities, thereby limiting their interpretability and yielding a lack of explanatory insights into their decision-making processes. In this work, we introduce Latent Boost, a novel approach that integrates advanced distance metric learning into supervised classification tasks, enhancing both interpretability and training efficiency. Thus during training, the model is not only optimized for classification metrics of the discrete data points but also adheres to the rule that the collective representation zones of each class should be sharply clustered. By leveraging the rich structural insights of intermediate model layer latent representations, Latent Boost improves classification interpretability, as demonstrated by higher Silhouette scores, while accelerating training convergence. These performance and latent structural benefits are achieved with minimum additional cost, making it broadly applicable across various datasets without requiring data-specific adjustments. Furthermore, Latent Boost introduces a new paradigm for aligning classification performance with improved model transparency to address the challenges of black-box models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Consider the scenario where multiple agents have to move in an optimal way through a network, each one towards their ending position while avoiding collisions. By optimal, we mean as fast as possible, which is evaluated by a measure known as the makespan of the proposed solution. This is the setting studied in the Multiagent Path Finding problem. In this work, we additionally provide the agents with a way to communicate with each other. Due to size constraints, it is reasonable to assume that the range of communication of each agent will be limited. What should be the trajectories of the agents to, additionally, maintain a backbone of communication? In this work, we study the Multiagent Path Finding with Communication Constraint problem under the parameterized complexity framework.
  Our main contribution is three exact algorithms that are efficient when considering particular structures for the input network. We provide such algorithms for the case when the communication range and the number of agents (the makespan resp.) are provided in the input and the network has a tree topology, or bounded maximum degree (has a tree-like topology, i.e., bounded treewidth resp.). We complement these results by showing that it is highly unlikely to construct efficient algorithms when considering the number of agents as part of the input, even if the makespan is $3$ and the communication range is $1$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Karthikeyan, Yash Vardhan Pant</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning has shown tremendous success in behavioral planning by learning from previously collected demonstrations. However, decision-making in multitask missions still presents significant challenges. For instance, a mission might require an agent to explore an unknown environment, discover goals, and navigate to them, even if it involves interacting with obstacles along the way. Such behavioral planning problems are difficult to solve due to: a) agents failing to adapt beyond the single task learned through their reward function, and b) the inability to generalize to new environments not covered in the training demonstrations, e.g., environments where all doors were unlocked in the demonstrations. Consequently, state-of-the-art decision making methods are limited to missions where the required tasks are well-represented in the training demonstrations and can be solved within a short (temporal) planning horizon. To address this, we propose GenPlan: a stochastic and adaptive planner that leverages discrete-flow models for generative sequence modeling, enabling sample-efficient exploration and exploitation. This framework relies on an iterative denoising procedure to generate a sequence of goals and actions. This approach captures multi-modal action distributions and facilitates goal and task discovery, thereby enhancing generalization to out-of-distribution tasks and environments, i.e., missions not part of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through multiple simulation environments. Notably, GenPlan outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by over 10% on adaptive planning tasks, where the agent adapts to multi-task missions while leveraging demonstrations on single-goal-reaching tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Kang, Srikant Bharadwaj, James Hensman, Tushar Krishna, Victor Ruhle, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.
  We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Both encoder-only models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and large language models (LLMs, e.g., Llama3) have been widely used for text classification tasks. However, there is a lack of systematic studies comparing the performance of encoder-based models and LLMs in text classification, particularly when fine-tuning is involved. This study employed a diverse range of models and methods, varying in size and architecture, and including both fine-tuned and pre-trained approaches. We first assessed the performances of these LLMs on the 20 Newsgroups (20NG) and MASSIVE datasets, comparing them to encoder-only RoBERTa models. Additionally, we explored the multi-task capabilities of both model types by combining multiple classification tasks, including intent detection and slot-filling, into a single model using data from both datasets. Our results indicate that fully fine-tuned Llama3-70B models outperform RoBERTa-large and other decoder LLMs across various classification tasks and datasets. Moreover, the consolidated multi-task fine-tuned LLMs matched the performance of dual-model setups in both tasks across both datasets. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive benchmark of encoder-only and LLM models on text classification tasks and demonstrates a method to combine two or more fully fine-tuned decoder LLMs for reduced latency and equivalent performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) suffers from the limited diversity and scale of training data, primarily constrained by the manual curation of existing simulators. To address this, we introduce RoomTour3D, a video-instruction dataset derived from web-based room tour videos that capture real-world indoor spaces and human walking demonstrations. Unlike existing VLN datasets, RoomTour3D leverages the scale and diversity of online videos to generate open-ended human walking trajectories and open-world navigable instructions. To compensate for the lack of navigation data in online videos, we perform 3D reconstruction and obtain 3D trajectories of walking paths augmented with additional information on the room types, object locations and 3D shape of surrounding scenes. Our dataset includes $\sim$100K open-ended description-enriched trajectories with $\sim$200K instructions, and 17K action-enriched trajectories from 1847 room tour environments. We demonstrate experimentally that RoomTour3D enables significant improvements across multiple VLN tasks including CVDN, SOON, R2R, and REVERIE. Moreover, RoomTour3D facilitates the development of trainable zero-shot VLN agents, showcasing the potential and challenges of advancing towards open-world navigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems aim to provide personalized recommendations for users based on their interaction history. To achieve this, they often incorporate auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and auxiliary tasks, like predicting user preferences and intent. Despite numerous efforts to enhance these models, they still suffer from limited personalization. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm, which we term preference discerning. In preference dscerning, we explicitly condition a generative sequential recommendation system on user preferences within its context. To this end, we generate user preferences using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on user reviews and item-specific data. To evaluate preference discerning capabilities of sequential recommendation systems, we introduce a novel benchmark that provides a holistic evaluation across various scenarios, including preference steering and sentiment following. We assess current state-of-the-art methods using our benchmark and show that they struggle to accurately discern user preferences. Therefore, we propose a new method named Mender ($\textbf{M}$ultimodal Prefer$\textbf{en}$ce $\textbf{d}$iscern$\textbf{er}$), which improves upon existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark. Our results show that Mender can be effectively guided by human preferences even though they have not been observed during training, paving the way toward more personalized sequential recommendation systems. We will open-source the code and benchmarks upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mintong Kang, Chejian Xu, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs) have enabled speech-based user interactions, significantly enhancing user experience and accelerating the deployment of LALMs in real-world applications. However, ensuring the safety of LALMs is crucial to prevent risky outputs that may raise societal concerns or violate AI regulations. Despite the importance of this issue, research on jailbreaking LALMs remains limited due to their recent emergence and the additional technical challenges they present compared to attacks on DNN-based audio models. Specifically, the audio encoders in LALMs, which involve discretization operations, often lead to gradient shattering, hindering the effectiveness of attacks relying on gradient-based optimizations. The behavioral variability of LALMs further complicates the identification of effective (adversarial) optimization targets. Moreover, enforcing stealthiness constraints on adversarial audio waveforms introduces a reduced, non-convex feasible solution space, further intensifying the challenges of the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, we develop AdvWave, the first jailbreak framework against LALMs. We propose a dual-phase optimization method that addresses gradient shattering, enabling effective end-to-end gradient-based optimization. Additionally, we develop an adaptive adversarial target search algorithm that dynamically adjusts the adversarial optimization target based on the response patterns of LALMs for specific queries. To ensure that adversarial audio remains perceptually natural to human listeners, we design a classifier-guided optimization approach that generates adversarial noise resembling common urban sounds. Extensive evaluations on multiple advanced LALMs demonstrate that AdvWave outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 40% higher average jailbreak attack success rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Raghavan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that the use of generative artificial intelligence reduces the diversity of content produced. In this work, we develop a game-theoretic model to explore the downstream consequences of content homogeneity when producers use generative AI to compete with one another. At equilibrium, players indeed produce content that is less diverse than optimal. However, stronger competition mitigates homogeneity and induces more diverse production. Perhaps more surprisingly, we show that a generative AI model that performs well in isolation (i.e., according to a benchmark) may fail to do so when faced with competition, and vice versa. We validate our results empirically by using language models to play Scattergories, a word game in which players are rewarded for producing answers that are both correct and unique. We discuss how the interplay between competition and homogeneity has implications for the development, evaluation, and use of generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madhu Kiran, Kartikey Vishnu, Rafael M. O. Cruz, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Image retrieval methods rely on metric learning to train backbone feature extraction models that can extract discriminant queries and reference (gallery) feature representations for similarity matching. Although state-of-the-art accuracy has improved considerably with the advent of deep learning (DL) models trained on large datasets, image retrieval remains challenging in many real-world video analytics and surveillance applications, e.g., person re-identification. Using the Euclidean space for matching limits the performance in real-world applications due to the curse of dimensionality, overfitting, and sensitivity to noisy data.
  We argue that the feature dissimilarity space is more suitable for similarity matching, and propose a dichotomy transformation to project query and reference embeddings into a single embedding in the dissimilarity space.
  We also advocate for end-to-end training of a backbone and binary classification models for pair-wise matching. As opposed to comparing the distance between queries and reference embeddings, we show the benefits of classifying the single dissimilarity space embedding (as similar or dissimilar), especially when trained end-to-end. We propose a method to train the max-margin classifier together with the backbone feature extractor by applying constraints to the L2 norm of the classifier weights along with the hinge loss.
  Our extensive experiments on challenging image retrieval datasets and using diverse feature extraction backbones highlight the benefits of similarity matching in the dissimilarity space. In particular, when jointly training the feature extraction backbone and regularised classifier for matching, the dissimilarity space provides a higher level of accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vahid Balazadeh, Mohammadmehdi Ataei, Hyunmin Cheong, Amir Hosein Khasahmadi, Rahul G. Krishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical reasoning, which involves the interpretation, understanding, and prediction of object behavior in dynamic environments, remains a significant challenge for current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we propose two methods to enhance VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities using simulated data. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained VLM using question-answer (QA) pairs generated from simulations relevant to physical reasoning tasks. Second, we introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), specialized VLMs fine-tuned to create scene descriptions enriched with physical properties and processes. During physical reasoning tasks, these PCBs can be leveraged as context to assist a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve its performance. We evaluate both of our approaches using multiple benchmarks, including a new stability detection QA dataset called Falling Tower, which includes both simulated and real-world scenes, and CLEVRER. We demonstrate that a small QA fine-tuned VLM can significantly outperform larger state-of-the-art foundational models. We also show that integrating PCBs boosts the performance of foundational LLMs on physical reasoning tasks. Using the real-world scenes from the Falling Tower dataset, we also validate the robustness of both approaches in Sim2Real transfer. Our results highlight the utility that simulated data can have in the creation of learning systems capable of advanced physical reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying the training data samples that most influence a generated image is a critical task in understanding diffusion models, yet existing influence estimation methods are constrained to small-scale or LoRA-tuned models due to computational limitations. As diffusion models scale up, these methods become impractical. To address this challenge, we propose DMin (Diffusion Model influence), a scalable framework for estimating the influence of each training data sample on a given generated image. By leveraging efficient gradient compression and retrieval techniques, DMin reduces storage requirements from 339.39 TB to only 726 MB and retrieves the top-k most influential training samples in under 1 second, all while maintaining performance. Our empirical results demonstrate DMin is both effective in identifying influential training samples and efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixun Xie, Sicheng Zuo, Wenzhao Zheng, Yunpeng Zhang, Dalong Du, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling the evolutions of driving scenarios is important for the evaluation and decision-making of autonomous driving systems. Most existing methods focus on one aspect of scene evolution such as map generation, motion prediction, and trajectory planning. In this paper, we propose a unified Generative Pre-training for Driving (GPD-1) model to accomplish all these tasks altogether without additional fine-tuning. We represent each scene with ego, agent, and map tokens and formulate autonomous driving as a unified token generation problem. We adopt the autoregressive transformer architecture and use a scene-level attention mask to enable intra-scene bi-directional interactions. For the ego and agent tokens, we propose a hierarchical positional tokenizer to effectively encode both 2D positions and headings. For the map tokens, we train a map vector-quantized autoencoder to efficiently compress ego-centric semantic maps into discrete tokens. We pre-train our GPD-1 on the large-scale nuPlan dataset and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. With different prompts, our GPD-1 successfully generalizes to various tasks without finetuning, including scene generation, traffic simulation, closed-loop simulation, map prediction, and motion planning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Foerster, Gregory Farquhar, Triantafyllos Afouras, Nantas Nardelli, Shimon Whiteson</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent systems can be naturally used to model many real world problems, such as network packet routing and the coordination of autonomous vehicles. There is a great need for new reinforcement learning methods that can efficiently learn decentralised policies for such systems. To this end, we propose a new multi-agent actor-critic method called counterfactual multi-agent (COMA) policy gradients. COMA uses a centralised critic to estimate the Q-function and decentralised actors to optimise the agents' policies. In addition, to address the challenges of multi-agent credit assignment, it uses a counterfactual baseline that marginalises out a single agent's action, while keeping the other agents' actions fixed. COMA also uses a critic representation that allows the counterfactual baseline to be computed efficiently in a single forward pass. We evaluate COMA in the testbed of StarCraft unit micromanagement, using a decentralised variant with significant partial observability. COMA significantly improves average performance over other multi-agent actor-critic methods in this setting, and the best performing agents are competitive with state-of-the-art centralised controllers that get access to the full state.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Xu, Dingkang Yang, Mingcheng Li, Yuzheng Wang, Zhaoyu Chen, Jiawei Chen, Jinjie Wei, Lihua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal intention understanding (MIU) is an indispensable component of human expression analysis (e.g., sentiment or humor) from heterogeneous modalities, including visual postures, linguistic contents, and acoustic behaviors. Existing works invariably focus on designing sophisticated structures or fusion strategies to achieve impressive improvements. Unfortunately, they all suffer from the subject variation problem due to data distribution discrepancies among subjects. Concretely, MIU models are easily misled by distinct subjects with different expression customs and characteristics in the training data to learn subject-specific spurious correlations, significantly limiting performance and generalizability across uninitiated subjects.Motivated by this observation, we introduce a recapitulative causal graph to formulate the MIU procedure and analyze the confounding effect of subjects. Then, we propose SuCI, a simple yet effective causal intervention module to disentangle the impact of subjects acting as unobserved confounders and achieve model training via true causal effects. As a plug-and-play component, SuCI can be widely applied to most methods that seek unbiased predictions. Comprehensive experiments on several MIU benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed module.</p>

Our findings reveal that the integration of LLM-based embeddings, in combination with general-purpose pre-trained embeddings, leads to substantial performance improvements. Drawing insights from this ablation study, we conduct a comparative analysis against competing models, thereby highlighting the state-of-the-art performance achieved by the proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Intelligent agents must autonomously interact with the environments to perform daily tasks based on human-level instructions. They need a foundational understanding of the world to accurately interpret these instructions, along with precise low-level movement and interaction skills to execute the derived actions. In this work, we propose the first complete system for synthesizing physically plausible, long-horizon human-object interactions for object manipulation in contextual environments, driven by human-level instructions. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to interpret the input instructions into detailed execution plans. Unlike prior work, our system is capable of generating detailed finger-object interactions, in seamless coordination with full-body movements. We also train a policy to track generated motions in physics simulation via reinforcement learning (RL) to ensure physical plausibility of the motion. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in synthesizing realistic interactions with diverse objects in complex environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</p>

Large-scale Transformer networks have quickly become the leading approach for advancing natural language processing algorithms. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models enable interactions that closely mimic human communication and, equipped with extensive knowledge, can even assist in guiding human tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities and growing complexity, a key question remains-the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs? To address these critical questions and explore the technological strategies within LLMs, we leverage the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) to offer a theoretical backdrop, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin these advancements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can peer recommendation engines elevate people's creative performances in self-organizing social networks? Answering this question requires resolving challenges in data collection (e.g., tracing inspiration links and psycho-social attributes of nodes) and intervention design (e.g., balancing idea stimulation and redundancy in evolving information environments). We trained a model that predicts people's ideation performances using semantic and network-structural features in an online platform. Using this model, we built SocialMuse, which maximizes people's predicted performances to generate peer recommendations for them. We found treatment networks leveraging SocialMuse outperforming AI-agnostic control networks in several creativity measures. The treatment networks were more decentralized than the control, as SocialMuse increasingly emphasized network-structural features at large network sizes. This decentralization spreads people's inspiration sources, helping inspired ideas stand out better.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michail Kinnas, John Violos, Ioannis Kompatsiaris, Symeon Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Energy efficiency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has become an important area of research, with various strategies being developed to minimize the power consumption of these models. Previous efforts, including techniques like model pruning, quantization, and hardware optimization, have made significant strides in this direction. However, there remains a need for more effective on device AI solutions that balance energy efficiency with model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reduce the energy requirements of inference of CNNs. Our methodology employs two small Complementary CNNs that collaborate with each other by covering each other's "weaknesses" in predictions. If the confidence for a prediction of the first CNN is considered low, the second CNN is invoked with the aim of producing a higher confidence prediction. This dual-CNN setup significantly reduces energy consumption compared to using a single large deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a memory component that retains previous classifications for identical inputs, bypassing the need to re-invoke the CNNs for the same input, further saving energy. Our experiments on a Jetson Nano computer demonstrate an energy reduction of up to 85.8% achieved on modified datasets where each sample was duplicated once. These findings indicate that leveraging a complementary CNN pair along with a memory component effectively reduces inference energy while maintaining high accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), like any transformative technology, has the potential to be a double-edged sword, leading either toward significant advancements or detrimental outcomes for society as a whole. As is often the case when it comes to widely-used technologies in market economies (e.g., cars and semiconductor chips), commercial interest tends to be the predominant guiding factor. The AI community is at risk of becoming polarized to either take a laissez-faire attitude toward AI development, or to call for government overregulation. Between these two poles we argue for the community of AI practitioners to consciously and proactively work for the common good. This paper offers a blueprint for a new type of innovation infrastructure including 18 concrete milestones to guide AI research in that direction. Our view is that we are still in the early days of practical AI, and focused efforts by practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders can still maximize the upsides of AI and minimize its downsides.
  We talked to luminaries such as recent Nobelist John Jumper on science, President Barack Obama on governance, former UN Ambassador and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice on security, philanthropist Eric Schmidt on several topics, and science fiction novelist Neal Stephenson on entertainment. This ongoing dialogue and collaborative effort has produced a comprehensive, realistic view of what the actual impact of AI could be, from a diverse assembly of thinkers with deep understanding of this technology and these domains. From these exchanges, five recurring guidelines emerged, which form the cornerstone of a framework for beginning to harness AI in service of the public good. They not only guide our efforts in discovery but also shape our approach to deploying this transformative technology responsibly and ethically.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data drift is a thorny challenge when deploying person re-identification (ReID) models into real-world devices, where the data distribution is significantly different from that of the training environment and keeps changing. To tackle this issue, we propose a federated spatial-temporal incremental learning approach, named FedSTIL, which leverages both lifelong learning and federated learning to continuously optimize models deployed on many distributed edge clients. Unlike previous efforts, FedSTIL aims to mine spatial-temporal correlations among the knowledge learnt from different edge clients. Specifically, the edge clients first periodically extract general representations of drifted data to optimize their local models. Then, the learnt knowledge from edge clients will be aggregated by centralized parameter server, where the knowledge will be selectively and attentively distilled from spatial- and temporal-dimension with carefully designed mechanisms. Finally, the distilled informative spatial-temporal knowledge will be sent back to correlated edge clients to further improve the recognition accuracy of each edge client with a lifelong learning method. Extensive experiments on a mixture of five real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms others by nearly 4% in Rank-1 accuracy, while reducing communication cost by 62%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anji Liu, Honghua Zhang, Guy Van den Broeck</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a unified framework for tractable probabilistic models that support efficient computation of various probabilistic queries (e.g., marginal probabilities). One key challenge is to scale PCs to model large and high-dimensional real-world datasets: we observe that as the number of parameters in PCs increases, their performance immediately plateaus. This phenomenon suggests that the existing optimizers fail to exploit the full expressive power of large PCs. We propose to overcome such bottleneck by latent variable distillation: we leverage the less tractable but more expressive deep generative models to provide extra supervision over the latent variables of PCs. Specifically, we extract information from Transformer-based generative models to assign values to latent variables of PCs, providing guidance to PC optimizers. Experiments on both image and language modeling benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet and WikiText-2) show that latent variable distillation substantially boosts the performance of large PCs compared to their counterparts without latent variable distillation. In particular, on the image modeling benchmarks, PCs achieve competitive performance against some of the widely-used deep generative models, including variational autoencoders and flow-based models, opening up new avenues for tractable generative modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Li, Jia Wu, Bo Du, Sergey V. Petoukhov, Huiting Xu, Zheman Xiao, Wenbin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: GNN-based methods have achieved excellent results as a mainstream task in drug response prediction tasks in recent years. Traditional GNN methods use only the atoms in a drug molecule as nodes to obtain the representation of the molecular graph through node information passing, whereas the method using the transformer can only extract information about the nodes. However, the covalent bonding and chirality of a drug molecule have a great influence on the pharmacological properties of the molecule, and these information are implied in the chemical bonds formed by the edges between the atoms. In addition, CNN methods for modelling cell lines genomics sequences can only perceive local rather than global information about the sequence. In order to solve the above problems, we propose the decoupled dual transformer structure with edge embedded for drug respond prediction (TransEDRP), which is used for the representation of cell line genomics and drug respectively. For the drug branch, we encoded the chemical bond information within the molecule as the embedding of the edge in the molecular graph, extracted the global structural and biochemical information of the drug molecule using graph transformer. For the branch of cell lines genomics, we use the multi-headed attention mechanism to globally represent the genomics sequence. Finally, the drug and genomics branches are fused to predict IC50 values through the transformer layer and the fully connected layer, which two branches are different modalities. Extensive experiments have shown that our method is better than the current mainstream approach in all evaluation indicators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Liu, Wenshan Li, Tao Li, Beibei Li, Guangquan Xu, Pan Zhou, Wengang Ma, Hanyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Zhao, Taotian Pang, Zhen Wu, Zheng Ma, Shujian Huang, Xinyu Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a new paradigm for natural language processing (NLP), where a large language model (LLM) observes a small number of demonstrations and a test instance as its input, and directly makes predictions without updating model parameters. Previous studies have revealed that ICL is sensitive to the selection and the ordering of demonstrations. However, there are few studies regarding the impact of the demonstration number on the ICL performance within a limited input length of LLM, because it is commonly believed that the number of demonstrations is positively correlated with model performance. In this paper, we found this conclusion does not always hold true. Through pilot experiments, we discover that increasing the number of demonstrations does not necessarily lead to improved performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a Dynamic Demonstrations Controller (D$^2$Controller), which can improve the ICL performance by adjusting the number of demonstrations dynamically. The experimental results show that D$^2$Controller yields a 4.6% relative improvement on ten different sizes of LLMs across ten datasets. Moreover, we also extend our method to previous ICL models and achieve competitive results.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce multiple physics pretraining (MPP), an autoregressive task-agnostic pretraining approach for physical surrogate modeling of spatiotemporal systems with transformers. In MPP, rather than training one model on a specific physical system, we train a backbone model to predict the dynamics of multiple heterogeneous physical systems simultaneously in order to learn features that are broadly useful across systems and facilitate transfer. In order to learn effectively in this setting, we introduce a shared embedding and normalization strategy that projects the fields of multiple systems into a shared embedding space. We validate the efficacy of our approach on both pretraining and downstream tasks over a broad fluid mechanics-oriented benchmark. We show that a single MPP-pretrained transformer is able to match or outperform task-specific baselines on all pretraining sub-tasks without the need for finetuning. For downstream tasks, we demonstrate that finetuning MPP-trained models results in more accurate predictions across multiple time-steps on systems with previously unseen physical components or higher dimensional systems compared to training from scratch or finetuning pretrained video foundation models. We open-source our code and model weights trained at multiple scales for reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xubin Ren, Wei Wei, Lianghao Xia, Lixin Su, Suqi Cheng, Junfeng Wang, Dawei Yin, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems have seen significant advancements with the influence of deep learning and graph neural networks, particularly in capturing complex user-item relationships. However, these graph-based recommenders heavily depend on ID-based data, potentially disregarding valuable textual information associated with users and items, resulting in less informative learned representations. Moreover, the utilization of implicit feedback data introduces potential noise and bias, posing challenges for the effectiveness of user preference learning. While the integration of large language models (LLMs) into traditional ID-based recommenders has gained attention, challenges such as scalability issues, limitations in text-only reliance, and prompt input constraints need to be addressed for effective implementation in practical recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework RLMRec that aims to enhance existing recommenders with LLM-empowered representation learning. It proposes a recommendation paradigm that integrates representation learning with LLMs to capture intricate semantic aspects of user behaviors and preferences. RLMRec incorporates auxiliary textual signals, develops a user/item profiling paradigm empowered by LLMs, and aligns the semantic space of LLMs with the representation space of collaborative relational signals through a cross-view alignment framework. This work further establish a theoretical foundation demonstrating that incorporating textual signals through mutual information maximization enhances the quality of representations. In our evaluation, we integrate RLMRec with state-of-the-art recommender models, while also analyzing its efficiency and robustness to noise data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shukang Yin, Chaoyou Fu, Sirui Zhao, Tong Xu, Hao Wang, Dianbo Sui, Yunhang Shen, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination is a big shadow hanging over the rapidly evolving Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), referring to the phenomenon that the generated text is inconsistent with the image content. In order to mitigate hallucinations, existing studies mainly resort to an instruction-tuning manner that requires retraining the models with specific data. In this paper, we pave a different way, introducing a training-free method named Woodpecker. Like a woodpecker heals trees, it picks out and corrects hallucinations from the generated text. Concretely, Woodpecker consists of five stages: key concept extraction, question formulation, visual knowledge validation, visual claim generation, and hallucination correction. Implemented in a post-remedy manner, Woodpecker can easily serve different MLLMs, while being interpretable by accessing intermediate outputs of the five stages. We evaluate Woodpecker both quantitatively and qualitatively and show the huge potential of this new paradigm. On the POPE benchmark, our method obtains a 30.66%/24.33% improvement in accuracy over the baseline MiniGPT-4/mPLUG-Owl. The source code is released at https://github.com/BradyFU/Woodpecker.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christoph H\"ummer, Manuel Schwonberg, Liangwei Zhou, Hu Cao, Alois Knoll, Hanno Gottschalk</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) remains a significant challenge for perception based on deep neural networks (DNNs), where domain shifts occur due to synthetic data, lighting, weather, or location changes. Vision-language models (VLMs) marked a large step for the generalization capabilities and have been already applied to various tasks. Very recently, first approaches utilized VLMs for domain generalized segmentation and object detection and obtained strong generalization. However, all these approaches rely on complex modules, feature augmentation frameworks or additional models. Surprisingly and in contrast to that, we found that simple fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models yields competitive or even stronger generalization results while being extremely simple to apply. Moreover, we found that vision-language pre-training consistently provides better generalization than the previous standard of vision-only pre-training. This challenges the standard of using ImageNet-based transfer learning for domain generalization. Fully fine-tuning a vision-language pre-trained model is capable of reaching the domain generalization SOTA when training on the synthetic GTA5 dataset. Moreover, we confirm this observation for object detection on a novel synthetic-to-real benchmark. We further obtain superior generalization capabilities by reaching 77.9% mIoU on the popular Cityscapes-to-ACDC benchmark. We also found improved in-domain generalization, leading to an improved SOTA of 86.4% mIoU on the Cityscapes test set marking the first place on the leaderboard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Imad Eddine Marouf, Subhankar Roy, Enzo Tartaglione, St\'ephane Lathuili\`ere</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of continual learning (CL) where the goal is to learn a model on a sequence of tasks, such that the data from the previous tasks becomes unavailable while learning on the current task data. CL is essentially a balancing act between being able to learn on the new task (i.e., plasticity) and maintaining the performance on the previously learned concepts (i.e., stability). Intending to address the stability-plasticity trade-off, we propose to perform weight-ensembling of the model parameters of the previous and current tasks. This weighted-ensembled model, which we call Continual Model Averaging (or CoMA), attains high accuracy on the current task by leveraging plasticity, while not deviating too far from the previous weight configuration, ensuring stability. We also propose an improved variant of CoMA, named Continual Fisher-weighted Model Averaging (or CoFiMA), that selectively weighs each parameter in the weights ensemble by leveraging the Fisher information of the weights of the model. Both variants are conceptually simple, easy to implement, and effective in attaining state-of-the-art performance on several standard CL benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Social recommendations have been widely adopted in substantial domains. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been employed in recommender systems due to their success in graph representation learning. However, dealing with the dynamic property of social network data is a challenge. This research presents a novel method that provides social recommendations by incorporating the dynamic property of social network data in a heterogeneous graph. The model aims to capture user preference over time without going through the complexities of a dynamic graph by adding period nodes to define users' long-term and short-term preferences and aggregating assigned edge weights. The model is applied to real-world data to argue its superior performance. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of this model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Li, Wenshuai Zhao, Lijun Wu, Joni Pajarinen</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning, centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) methods typically assume that agents make decisions based on their local observations independently, which may not lead to a correlated joint policy with coordination. Coordination can be explicitly encouraged during training and individual policies can be trained to imitate the correlated joint policy. However, this may lead to an \textit{asymmetric learning failure} due to the observation mismatch between the joint and individual policies. Inspired by the concept of correlated equilibrium, we introduce a \textit{strategy modification} called AgentMixer that allows agents to correlate their policies. AgentMixer combines individual partially observable policies into a joint fully observable policy non-linearly. To enable decentralized execution, we introduce \textit{Individual-Global-Consistency} to guarantee mode consistency during joint training of the centralized and decentralized policies and prove that AgentMixer converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate Correlated Equilibrium. In the Multi-Agent MuJoCo, SMAC-v2, Matrix Game, and Predator-Prey benchmarks, AgentMixer outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent across many real-world applications, understanding and enhancing their robustness to adversarial attacks is of paramount importance. Existing methods for identifying adversarial prompts tend to focus on specific domains, lack diversity, or require extensive human annotations. To address these limitations, we present Rainbow Teaming, a novel black-box approach for producing a diverse collection of adversarial prompts. Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity problem and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective and diverse. Focusing on the safety domain, we use Rainbow Teaming to target various state-of-the-art LLMs, including the Llama 2 and Llama 3 models. Our approach reveals hundreds of effective adversarial prompts, with an attack success rate exceeding 90% across all tested models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prompts generated by Rainbow Teaming are highly transferable and that fine-tuning models with synthetic data generated by our method significantly enhances their safety without sacrificing general performance or helpfulness. We additionally explore the versatility of Rainbow Teaming by applying it to question answering and cybersecurity, showcasing its potential to drive robust open-ended self-improvement in a wide range of applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a subfield of machine learning for training autonomous agents that take sequential actions across complex environments. Despite its significant performance in well-known environments, it remains susceptible to minor condition variations, raising concerns about its reliability in real-world applications. To improve usability, DRL must demonstrate trustworthiness and robustness. A way to improve the robustness of DRL to unknown changes in the environmental conditions and possible perturbations is through Adversarial Training, by training the agent against well-suited adversarial attacks on the observations and the dynamics of the environment. Addressing this critical issue, our work presents an in-depth analysis of contemporary adversarial attack and training methodologies, systematically categorizing them and comparing their objectives and operational mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, for biometric tasks. We specifically examine the capabilities of ChatGPT in performing biometric-related tasks, with an emphasis on face recognition, gender detection, and age estimation.

Our study reveals that ChatGPT recognizes facial identities and differentiates between two facial images with considerable accuracy. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in gender detection and reasonable accuracy for the age estimation tasks. Our findings shed light on the promising potentials in the application of LLMs and foundation models for biometrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) stand as a revolutionary advancement in the modern era of artificial intelligence (AI). However, scaling down LLMs for resource-constrained hardware, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices requires non-trivial efforts and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel information-entropy framework for designing mobile-friendly generative language models. The whole design procedure involves solving a mathematical programming (MP) problem, which can be done on the CPU within minutes, making it nearly zero-cost. We evaluate our designed models, termed MeRino, across fourteen NLP downstream tasks, showing their competitive performance against the state-of-the-art autoregressive transformer models under the mobile setting. Notably, MeRino achieves similar or better performance on both language modeling and zero-shot learning tasks, compared to the 350M parameter OPT while being 4.9x faster on NVIDIA Jetson Nano with 5.5x reduction in model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elaine Sui, Xiaohan Wang, Serena Yeung-Levy</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have propelled the field of computer vision, particularly in the zero-shot learning setting. Despite their promise, the effectiveness of these models often diminishes due to domain shifts in test environments. To address this, we introduce the Test-Time Prototype Shifting (TPS) framework, a pioneering approach designed to adapt VLMs to test datasets using unlabeled test inputs. Our method is based on the notion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By pre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text encoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for subsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current advancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift vectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively bridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect of our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands when compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations across 15 image classification datasets involving natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset generalization, as well as in context-dependent visual reasoning, demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing resource requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Subwavelength photonic structures and metamaterials provide revolutionary approaches for controlling light. The inverse design methods proposed for these subwavelength structures are vital to the development of new photonic devices. However, most of the existing inverse design methods cannot realize direct mapping from optical properties to photonic structures but instead rely on forward simulation methods to perform iterative optimization. In this work, we exploit the powerful generative abilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and propose a practical inverse design method based on latent diffusion models. Our method maps directly the optical properties to structures without the requirement of forward simulation and iterative optimization. Here, the given optical properties can work as "prompts" and guide the constructed model to correctly "draw" the required photonic structures. Experiments show that our direct mapping-based inverse design method can generate subwavelength photonic structures at high fidelity while following the given optical properties. This may change the method used for optical design and greatly accelerate the research on new photonic devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Li, Yucheng Shi, Zirui Liu, Fan Yang, Ali Payani, Ninghao Liu, Mengnan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) relies on extensive text corpora, which are often unevenly distributed across languages. This imbalance results in LLMs performing significantly better on high-resource languages like English, German, and French, while their capabilities in low-resource languages remain inadequate. Currently, there is a lack of quantitative methods to evaluate the performance of LLMs in these low-resource languages. To address this gap, we propose the Language Ranker, an intrinsic metric designed to benchmark and rank languages based on LLM performance using internal representations. By comparing the LLM's internal representation of various languages against a baseline derived from English, we can assess the model's multilingual capabilities in a robust and language-agnostic manner. Our analysis reveals that high-resource languages exhibit higher similarity scores with English, demonstrating superior performance, while low-resource languages show lower similarity scores, underscoring the effectiveness of our metric in assessing language-specific capabilities. Besides, the experiments show that there is a strong correlation between the LLM's performance in different languages and the proportion of those languages in its pre-training corpus. These insights underscore the efficacy of the Language Ranker as a tool for evaluating LLM performance across different languages, particularly those with limited resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaohao Yuan, Songyou Li, Geyan Ye, Yikun Zhang, Long-Kai Huang, Wenbing Huang, Wei Liu, Jianhua Yao, Yu Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: The core challenge of de novo protein design lies in creating proteins with specific functions or properties, guided by certain conditions. Current models explore to generate protein using structural and evolutionary guidance, which only provide indirect conditions concerning functions and properties. However, textual annotations of proteins, especially the annotations for protein domains, which directly describe the protein's high-level functionalities, properties, and their correlation with target amino acid sequences, remain unexplored in the context of protein design tasks. In this paper, we propose Protein-Annotation Alignment Generation, PAAG, a multi-modality protein design framework that integrates the textual annotations extracted from protein database for controllable generation in sequence space. Specifically, within a multi-level alignment module, PAAG can explicitly generate proteins containing specific domains conditioned on the corresponding domain annotations, and can even design novel proteins with flexible combinations of different kinds of annotations. Our experimental results underscore the superiority of the aligned protein representations from PAAG over 7 prediction tasks. Furthermore, PAAG demonstrates a significant increase in generation success rate (24.7% vs 4.7% in zinc finger, and 54.3% vs 22.0% in the immunoglobulin domain) in comparison to the existing model. We anticipate that PAAG will broaden the horizons of protein design by leveraging the knowledge from between textual annotation and proteins.</p>

We extended that research with a large-scale study involving 9 state-of-the-art models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini, Google's Gemini Pro 1.0, TII's 180 billion-parameter Falcon, Meta's 13 billion-parameter Code Llama, and several other compact models. Additionally, we introduce the FormAI-v2 dataset, which comprises 331 000 compilable C programs generated by these LLMs. Each program in the dataset is labeled based on the vulnerabilities detected in its source code through formal verification, using the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC). This technique minimizes false positives by providing a counterexample for the specific vulnerability and reduces false negatives by thoroughly completing the verification process. Our study reveals that at least 62.07% of the generated programs are vulnerable. The differences between the models are minor, as they all show similar coding errors with slight variations. Our research highlights that while LLMs offer promising capabilities for code generation, deploying their output in a production environment requires proper risk assessment and validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengxiang Lan, Enneng Yang, Yuting Liu, Guibing Guo, Jianzhe Zhao, Xingwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt tuning is a promising method to fine-tune a pre-trained language model without retraining its large-scale parameters. Instead, it attaches a soft prompt to the input text, whereby downstream tasks can be well adapted by merely learning the embeddings of prompt tokens. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two challenges: (i) they are hard to balance accuracy and efficiency. A longer (shorter) soft prompt generally leads to a better(worse) accuracy but at the cost of more (less) training time. (ii)The performance may not be consistent when adapting to different downstream tasks. We attribute it to the same embedding space but responsible for different requirements of downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Efficient Prompt Tuning method (EPT) by multi-space projection and prompt fusion. Specifically, it decomposes a given soft prompt into a shorter prompt and two low-rank matrices, significantly reducing the training time. Accuracy is also enhanced by leveraging low-rank matrices and the short prompt as additional knowledge sources to enrich the semantics of the original short prompt. In addition, we project the soft prompt into multiple subspaces to improve the performance consistency, and then adaptively learn the combination weights of different spaces through a gating network. Experiments on 13 natural language processing downstream tasks show that our method significantly and consistently outperforms 11 comparison methods with the relative percentage of improvements up to 12.9%, and training time decreased by 14%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Holli Sargeant, Ahmed Izzidien, Felix Steffek</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in legal analytics by developing and applying a novel taxonomy for topic classification of summary judgment cases in the United Kingdom. Using a curated dataset of summary judgment cases, we use the Large Language Model Claude 3 Opus to explore functional topics and trends. We find that Claude 3 Opus correctly classified the topic with an accuracy of 87.13% and an F1 score of 0.87. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in the application of summary judgments across various legal domains. As case law in the United Kingdom is not originally labelled with keywords or a topic filtering option, the findings not only refine our understanding of the thematic underpinnings of summary judgments but also illustrate the potential of combining traditional and AI-driven approaches in legal classification. Therefore, this paper provides a new and general taxonomy for UK law. The implications of this work serve as a foundation for further research and policy discussions in the field of judicial administration and computational legal research methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokil Ham, Sangmin Woo, Jin-Young Kim, Hyojun Go, Byeongjun Park, Changick Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Diffusion Model Patching (DMP), a simple method to boost the performance of pre-trained diffusion models that have already reached convergence, with a negligible increase in parameters. DMP inserts a small, learnable set of prompts into the model's input space while keeping the original model frozen. The effectiveness of DMP is not merely due to the addition of parameters but stems from its dynamic gating mechanism, which selects and combines a subset of learnable prompts at every timestep (i.e., reverse denoising steps). This strategy, which we term "mixture-of-prompts", enables the model to draw on the distinct expertise of each prompt, essentially "patching" the model's functionality at every timestep with minimal yet specialized parameters. Uniquely, DMP enhances the model by further training on the original dataset already used for pre-training, even in a scenario where significant improvements are typically not expected due to model convergence. Notably, DMP significantly enhances the FID of converged DiT-L/2 by 10.38% on FFHQ, achieved with only a 1.43% parameter increase and 50K additional training iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chujie Gao, Siyuan Wu, Yue Huang, Dongping Chen, Qihui Zhang, Zhengyan Fu, Yao Wan, Lichao Sun, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various industries due to their exceptional generative capabilities. However, for safe and effective real-world deployments, ensuring honesty and helpfulness is critical. This paper addresses the question: Can we prioritize the helpfulness of LLMs while preserving their honesty? To begin with, we establish exhaustive principles aimed at guaranteeing the honesty of LLM. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, referred to as HoneSet, comprising 930 queries spanning six categories meticulously crafted to assess an LLM's capacity for maintaining honesty. Subsequently, we present two approaches to augmenting honesty and helpfulness in LLMs: a training-free enhancement and a fine-tuning-based improvement. The training-free approach, which is based on curiosity-driven prompting, empowers LLMs to articulate internal confusion and uncertainty regarding queries, thereby optimizing their responses. Conversely, the fine-tuning-based method employs a two-stage process inspired by curriculum learning: initially instructing LLMs to discern between honest and dishonest responses, then refining their training to enhance helpfulness. Experiments conducted on nine prominent LLMs demonstrate a significant improvement in alignment with honesty across all models through the implementation of our proposed enhancements. Particularly noteworthy is the 65.3% enhancement observed in Llama3-8b and the remarkable 124.7% improvement in Mistral-7b, as measured by the H$^{2}$ (honest and helpful) assessment. We believe that our work can pave the way for developing more trustworthy LLMs for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hakaze Cho, Yoshihiro Sakai, Kenshiro Tanaka, Mariko Kato, Naoya Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the output token probability information in the output embedding of language models. We find an approximate common log-linear encoding of output token probabilities within the output embedding vectors and empirically demonstrate that it is accurate and sparse. As a causality examination, we steer the encoding in output embedding to modify the output probability distribution accurately. Moreover, the sparsity we find in output probability encoding suggests that a large number of dimensions in the output embedding do not contribute to causal language modeling. Therefore, we attempt to delete the output-unrelated dimensions and find more than 30% of the dimensions can be deleted without significant movement in output distribution and sequence generation. Additionally, in the pre-training dynamics of language models, we find that the output embeddings capture the corpus token frequency information in early steps, even before an obvious convergence of parameters starts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adithya Vasudev</p>
<p>Abstract: The Lottery Ticket hypothesis proposes that ideal, sparse subnetworks, called lottery tickets, exist in untrained dense neural networks. The Early Bird hypothesis proposes an efficient algorithm to find these winning lottery tickets in convolutional neural networks, using the novel concept of distance between subnetworks to detect convergence in the subnetworks of a model. However, this approach overlooks unchanging groups of unimportant neurons near the search's end. We proposes WORM, a method that exploits these static groups by truncating their gradients, forcing the model to rely on other neurons. Experiments show WORM achieves faster ticket identification during training on convolutional neural networks, despite the additional computational overhead, when compared to EarlyBird search. Additionally, WORM-pruned models lose less accuracy during pruning and recover accuracy faster, improving the robustness of a given model. Furthermore, WORM is also able to generalize the Early Bird hypothesis reasonably well to larger models, such as transformers, displaying its flexibility to adapt to more complex architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sherzod Hakimov, Yerkezhan Abdullayeva, Kushal Koshti, Antonia Schmidt, Yan Weiser, Anne Beyer, David Schlangen</p>
<p>Abstract: While the situation has improved for text-only models, it again seems to be the case currently that multimodal (text and image) models develop faster than ways to evaluate them. In this paper, we bring a recently developed evaluation paradigm from text models to multimodal models, namely evaluation through the goal-oriented game (self) play, complementing reference-based and preference-based evaluation. Specifically, we define games that challenge a model's capability to represent a situation from visual information and align such representations through dialogue. We find that the largest closed models perform rather well on the games that we define, while even the best open-weight models struggle with them. On further analysis, we find that the exceptional deep captioning capabilities of the largest models drive some of the performance. There is still room to grow for both kinds of models, ensuring the continued relevance of the benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial representation learning (SRL) aims at learning general-purpose neural network representations from various types of spatial data (e.g., points, polylines, polygons, networks, images, etc.) in their native formats. Learning good spatial representations is a fundamental problem for various downstream applications such as species distribution modeling, weather forecasting, trajectory generation, geographic question answering, etc. Even though SRL has become the foundation of almost all geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) research, we have not yet seen significant efforts to develop an extensive deep learning framework and benchmark to support SRL model development and evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose TorchSpatial, a learning framework and benchmark for location (point) encoding, which is one of the most fundamental data types of spatial representation learning. TorchSpatial contains three key components: 1) a unified location encoding framework that consolidates 15 commonly recognized location encoders, ensuring scalability and reproducibility of the implementations; 2) the LocBench benchmark tasks encompassing 7 geo-aware image classification and 10 geo-aware image regression datasets; 3) a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics to quantify geo-aware models' overall performance as well as their geographic bias, with a novel Geo-Bias Score metric. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and insights into the model performance and geographic bias of different location encoders. We believe TorchSpatial will foster future advancement of spatial representation learning and spatial fairness in GeoAI research. The TorchSpatial model framework, LocBench, and Geo-Bias Score evaluation framework are available at https://github.com/seai-lab/TorchSpatial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vidya Prasad, Hans van Gorp, Christina Humer, Ruud J. G. van Sloun, Anna Vilanova, Nicola Pezzotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models, widely used in image generation, rely on iterative refinement to generate images from noise. Understanding this data evolution is important for model development and interpretability, yet challenging due to its high-dimensional, iterative nature. Prior works often focus on static or instance-level analyses, missing the iterative and holistic aspects of the generative path. While dimensionality reduction can visualize image evolution for few instances, it does preserve the iterative structure. To address these gaps, we introduce EvolvED, a method that presents a holistic view of the iterative generative process in diffusion models. EvolvED goes beyond instance exploration by leveraging predefined research questions to streamline generative space exploration. Tailored prompts aligned with these questions are used to extract intermediate images, preserving iterative context. Targeted feature extractors trace the evolution of key image attribute evolution, addressing the complexity of high-dimensional outputs. Central to EvolvED is a novel evolutionary embedding algorithm that encodes iterative steps while maintaining semantic relations. It enhances the visualization of data evolution by clustering semantically similar elements within each iteration with t-SNE, grouping elements by iteration, and aligning an instance's elements across iterations. We present rectilinear and radial layouts to represent iterations and support exploration. We apply EvolvED to diffusion models like GLIDE and Stable Diffusion, demonstrating its ability to provide valuable insights into the generative process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arijit Sehanobish, Avinava Dubey, Krzysztof Choromanski, Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury, Deepali Jain, Vikas Sindhwani, Snigdha Chaturvedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent efforts to scale Transformer models have demonstrated rapid progress across a wide range of tasks (Wei et al., 2022). However, fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks is expensive due to their large parameter counts. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches have emerged as a viable alternative by allowing us to fine-tune models by updating only a small number of parameters. In this work, we propose a general framework for parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), based on structured unrestricted-rank matrices (SURM) which can serve as a drop-in replacement for popular approaches such as Adapters and LoRA. Unlike other methods like LoRA, SURMs provides more flexibility in finding the right balance between compactness and expressiveness. This is achieved by using low displacement rank matrices (LDRMs), which hasn't been used in this context before. SURMs remain competitive with baselines, often providing significant quality improvements while using a smaller parameter budget. SURMs achieve 5-7% accuracy gains on various image classification tasks while replacing low-rank matrices in LoRA. It also results in up to 12x reduction of the number of parameters in adapters (with virtually no loss in quality) on the GLUE benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayan Kiyani, George Pappas, Hamed Hassani</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional validity and length efficiency are two crucial aspects of conformal prediction (CP). Conditional validity ensures accurate uncertainty quantification for data subpopulations, while proper length efficiency ensures that the prediction sets remain informative. Despite significant efforts to address each of these issues individually, a principled framework that reconciles these two objectives has been missing in the CP literature. In this paper, we develop Conformal Prediction with Length-Optimization (CPL) - a novel and practical framework that constructs prediction sets with (near-) optimal length while ensuring conditional validity under various classes of covariate shifts, including the key cases of marginal and group-conditional coverage. In the infinite sample regime, we provide strong duality results which indicate that CPL achieves conditional validity and length optimality. In the finite sample regime, we show that CPL constructs conditionally valid prediction sets. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior prediction set size performance of CPL compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse real-world and synthetic datasets in classification, regression, and large language model-based multiple choice question answering.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Core Francisco Park, Maya Okawa, Andrew Lee, Hidenori Tanaka, Ekdeep Singh Lubana</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern generative models demonstrate impressive capabilities, likely stemming from an ability to identify and manipulate abstract concepts underlying their training data. However, fundamental questions remain: what determines the concepts a model learns, the order in which it learns them, and its ability to manipulate those concepts? To address these questions, we propose analyzing a model's learning dynamics via a framework we call the concept space, where each axis represents an independent concept underlying the data generating process. By characterizing learning dynamics in this space, we identify how the speed at which a concept is learned, and hence the order of concept learning, is controlled by properties of the data we term concept signal. Further, we observe moments of sudden turns in the direction of a model's learning dynamics in concept space. Surprisingly, these points precisely correspond to the emergence of hidden capabilities, i.e., where latent interventions show the model possesses the capability to manipulate a concept, but these capabilities cannot yet be elicited via naive input prompting. While our results focus on synthetically defined toy datasets, we hypothesize a general claim on emergence of hidden capabilities may hold: generative models possess latent capabilities that emerge suddenly and consistently during training, though a model might not exhibit these capabilities under naive input prompting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Liu, Siqi Cai, Qihua Zhou, Song Guo, Ruibin Li, Kaiwei Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Perturbation-based mechanisms, such as differential privacy, mitigate gradient leakage attacks by introducing noise into the gradients, thereby preventing attackers from reconstructing clients' private data from the leaked gradients. However, can gradient perturbation protection mechanisms truly defend against all gradient leakage attacks? In this paper, we present the first attempt to break the shield of gradient perturbation protection in Federated Learning for the extraction of private information. We focus on common noise distributions, specifically Gaussian and Laplace, and apply our approach to DNN and CNN models. We introduce Mjolnir, a perturbation-resilient gradient leakage attack that is capable of removing perturbations from gradients without requiring additional access to the original model structure or external data. Specifically, we leverage the inherent diffusion properties of gradient perturbation protection to develop a novel diffusion-based gradient denoising model for Mjolnir. By constructing a surrogate client model that captures the structure of perturbed gradients, we obtain crucial gradient data for training the diffusion model. We further utilize the insight that monitoring disturbance levels during the reverse diffusion process can enhance gradient denoising capabilities, allowing Mjolnir to generate gradients that closely approximate the original, unperturbed versions through adaptive sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mjolnir effectively recovers the protected gradients and exposes the Federated Learning process to the threat of gradient leakage, achieving superior performance in gradient denoising and private data recovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haifeng Ruan, Yuntong Zhang, Abhik Roychoudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous program improvement typically involves automatically producing bug fixes and feature additions. Such program improvement can be accomplished by a combination of large language model (LLM) and program analysis capabilities, in the form of an LLM agent. Since program repair or program improvement typically requires a specification of intended behavior - specification inference can be useful for producing high quality program patches. In this work, we examine efficient and low-cost workflows for iterative specification inference within an LLM agent. Given a GitHub issue to be resolved in a software project, our goal is to conduct iterative code search accompanied by specification inference - thereby inferring intent from both the project structure and behavior. The intent thus captured is examined by a reviewer agent with the goal of vetting the patches as well as providing a measure of confidence in the vetted patches. Our approach SpecRover (AutoCodeRover-v2) is built on the open-source LLM agent AutoCodeRover. In an evaluation on the full SWE-Bench consisting of 2294 GitHub issues, it shows more than 50% improvement in efficacy over AutoCodeRover. Compared to the open-source agents available, our work shows modest cost ($0.65 per issue) in resolving an average GitHub issue in SWE-Bench lite. The production of explanation by SpecRover allows for a better "signal" to be given to the developer, on when the suggested patches can be accepted with confidence. SpecRover also seeks to demonstrate the continued importance of specification inference in automated program repair, even as program repair technologies enter the LLM era.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ignacy St\k{e}pka, Mateusz Lango, Jerzy Stefanowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) guide users on how to adjust inputs to machine learning models to achieve desired outputs. While existing research primarily addresses static scenarios, real-world applications often involve data or model changes, potentially invalidating previously generated CFEs and rendering user-induced input changes ineffective. Current methods addressing this issue often support only specific models or change types, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, or fail to provide probabilistic guarantees on CFE robustness to model changes. This paper proposes a novel approach for generating CFEs that provides probabilistic guarantees for any model and change type, while offering interpretable and easy-to-select hyperparameters. We establish a theoretical framework for probabilistically defining robustness to model change and demonstrate how our BetaRCE method directly stems from it. BetaRCE is a post-hoc method applied alongside a chosen base CFE generation method to enhance the quality of the explanation beyond robustness. It facilitates a transition from the base explanation to a more robust one with user-adjusted probability bounds. Through experimental comparisons with baselines, we show that BetaRCE yields robust, most plausible, and closest to baseline counterfactual explanations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate survival prediction in radiotherapy (RT) is critical for optimizing treatment decisions. This study developed and validated the RT-Surv framework, which integrates general-domain, open-source large language models (LLMs) to structure unstructured electronic health records alongside structured clinical data. Using data from 34,276 patients and an external cohort of 852, the framework successfully transformed unstructured clinical information into structured formats. Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features improved the concordance index from 0.779 to 0.842 during external validation, demonstrating a significant performance enhancement. Key LLM-structured features, such as disease extent, general condition, and RT purpose, showed high predictive importance and aligned closely with statistically significant predictors identified through conventional statistical analyses, thereby improving model interpretability. Furthermore, the framework enhanced risk stratification, enabling more distinct differentiation among low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups (p < 0.001) using LLM-structured clinical features. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to convert unstructured data into actionable insights, improving predictive modeling and patient outcomes in clinics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyao Tang, Glen Berseth</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks provide Reinforcement Learning (RL) powerful function approximators to address large-scale decision-making problems. However, these approximators introduce challenges due to the non-stationary nature of RL training. One source of the challenges in RL is that output predictions can churn, leading to uncontrolled changes after each batch update for states not included in the batch. Although such a churn phenomenon exists in each step of network training, how churn occurs and impacts RL remains under-explored. In this work, we start by characterizing churn in a view of Generalized Policy Iteration with function approximation, and we discover a chain effect of churn that leads to a cycle where the churns in value estimation and policy improvement compound and bias the learning dynamics throughout the iteration. Further, we concretize the study and focus on the learning issues caused by the chain effect in different settings, including greedy action deviation in value-based methods, trust region violation in proximal policy optimization, and dual bias of policy value in actor-critic methods. We then propose a method to reduce the chain effect across different settings, called Churn Approximated ReductIoN (CHAIN), which can be easily plugged into most existing DRL algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both reducing churn and improving learning performance across online and offline, value-based and policy-based RL settings, as well as a scaling setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianou Ma, Weirui Peng, Chenyang Yang, Hua Shen, Kenneth Koedinger, Tongshuang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompting LLMs for complex tasks (e.g., building a trip advisor chatbot) needs humans to clearly articulate customized requirements (e.g., "start the response with a tl;dr"). However, existing prompt engineering instructions often lack focused training on requirement articulation and instead tend to emphasize increasingly automatable strategies (e.g., tricks like adding role-plays and "think step-by-step"). To address the gap, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a randomized controlled experiment with 30 novices, ROPE significantly outperforms conventional prompt engineering training (20% vs. 1% gains), a gap that automatic prompt optimization cannot close. Furthermore, we demonstrate a direct correlation between the quality of input requirements and LLM outputs. Our work paves the way to empower more end-users to build complex LLM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyi Wang, Xiuju Du, Jing Liu, Shuyi Ouyang, Yen-Wei Chen, Lanfen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) has facilitated the spatially-aware profiling of gene expressions based on histopathology images. Although ST data offers valuable insights into the micro-environment of tumors, its acquisition cost remains expensive. Therefore, directly predicting the ST expressions from digital pathology images is desired. Current methods usually adopt existing regression backbones along with patch-sampling for this task, which ignores the inherent multi-scale information embedded in the pyramidal data structure of digital pathology images, and wastes the inter-spot visual information crucial for accurate gene expression prediction. To address these limitations, we propose M2OST, a many-to-one regression Transformer that can accommodate the hierarchical structure of the pathology images via a decoupled multi-scale feature extractor. Unlike traditional models that are trained with one-to-one image-label pairs, M2OST uses multiple images from different levels of the digital pathology image to jointly predict the gene expressions in their common corresponding spot. Built upon our many-to-one scheme, M2OST can be easily scaled to fit different numbers of inputs, and its network structure inherently incorporates nearby inter-spot features, enhancing regression performance. We have tested M2OST on three public ST datasets and the experimental results show that M2OST can achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanyu Meng, Xin Liu, Zhaodan Kong, Xin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has garnered significant attention for enhancing transparency and trust in machine learning models. However, the scopes of most existing explanation techniques focus either on offering a holistic view of the explainee model (global explanation) or on individual instances (local explanation), while the middle ground, i.e., cohort-based explanation, is less explored. Cohort explanations offer insights into the explainee's behavior on a specific group or cohort of instances, enabling a deeper understanding of model decisions within a defined context. In this paper, we discuss the unique challenges and opportunities associated with measuring cohort explanations, define their desired properties, and create a generalized framework for generating cohort explanations based on supervised clustering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building on the success of large language models (LLMs), recent advancements such as GPT-4o have enabled real-time speech interactions through LLM-based voice assistants, offering a significantly improved user experience compared to traditional text-based interactions. However, the absence of benchmarks designed to evaluate these speech interaction capabilities has hindered progress of LLM-based voice assistants development. Current evaluations focus primarily on automatic speech recognition (ASR) or general knowledge evaluation with clean speeches, neglecting the more intricate, real-world scenarios that involve diverse speaker characteristics, environmental and content factors. To address this, we introduce VoiceBench, the first benchmark designed to provide a multi-faceted evaluation of LLM-based voice assistants. VoiceBench also includes both real and synthetic spoken instructions that incorporate the above three key real-world variations. Extensive experiments reveal the limitations of current LLM-based voice assistant models and offer valuable insights for future research and development in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Liu, Axel Elaldi, Nathan Russell, Olivia Viessmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient encoding and representation of large 3D molecular structures with high fidelity is critical for biomolecular design applications. Despite this, many representation learning approaches restrict themselves to modeling smaller systems or use coarse-grained approximations of the systems, for example modeling proteins at the resolution of amino acid residues rather than at the level of individual atoms. To address this, we develop quantized auto-encoders that learn atom-level tokenizations of complete proteins, RNA and small molecule structures with reconstruction accuracies well below 1 Angstrom. We demonstrate that a simple Mamba state space model architecture is efficient compared to an SE(3)-invariant IPA architecture, reaches competitive accuracies and can scale to systems with almost 100,000 atoms. The learned structure tokens of bio2token may serve as the input for all-atom generative models in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junran Wu, Xueyuan Chen, Shangzhe Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph contrastive learning has achieved great success in pre-training graph neural networks without ground-truth labels. Leading graph contrastive learning follows the classical scheme of contrastive learning, forcing model to identify the essential information from augmented views. However, general augmented views are produced via random corruption or learning, which inevitably leads to semantics alteration. Although domain knowledge guided augmentations alleviate this issue, the generated views are domain specific and undermine the generalization. In this work, motivated by the firm representation ability of sparse model from pruning, we reformulate the problem of graph contrastive learning via contrasting different model versions rather than augmented views. We first theoretically reveal the superiority of model pruning in contrast to data augmentations. In practice, we take original graph as input and dynamically generate a perturbed graph encoder to contrast with the original encoder by pruning its transformation weights. Furthermore, considering the integrity of node embedding in our method, we are capable of developing a local contrastive loss to tackle the hard negative samples that disturb the model training. We extensively validate our method on various benchmarks regarding graph classification via unsupervised and transfer learning. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works, better performance can always be obtained by the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23748">Exploring Consistency in Graph Representations:from Graph Kernels to Graph Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyuan Liu, Yinghao Cai, Qihui Yang, Yujun Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant approach in graph representation learning, yet they often struggle to capture consistent similarity relationships among graphs. While graph kernel methods such as the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree (WL-subtree) and Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment (WLOA) kernels are effective in capturing similarity relationships, they rely heavily on predefined kernels and lack sufficient non-linearity for more complex data patterns. Our work aims to bridge the gap between neural network methods and kernel approaches by enabling GNNs to consistently capture relational structures in their learned representations. Given the analogy between the message-passing process of GNNs and WL algorithms, we thoroughly compare and analyze the properties of WL-subtree and WLOA kernels. We find that the similarities captured by WLOA at different iterations are asymptotically consistent, ensuring that similar graphs remain similar in subsequent iterations, thereby leading to superior performance over the WL-subtree kernel. Inspired by these findings, we conjecture that the consistency in the similarities of graph representations across GNN layers is crucial in capturing relational structures and enhancing graph classification performance. Thus, we propose a loss to enforce the similarity of graph representations to be consistent across different layers. Our empirical analysis verifies our conjecture and shows that our proposed consistency loss can significantly enhance graph classification performance across several GNN backbones on various datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Ramachandran, Souvik Kundu, Tushar Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude features called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm/architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, in this paper, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of simple multi-precision INT processing elements and a novel network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike existing alternatives, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across various quantization settings show that MicroScopiQ achieves SoTA quantization performance while simultaneously improving inference performance by 3x and reducing energy by 2x over existing alternatives.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI language models (LMs) show promise for biological sequence analysis. We re-engineered open-source LMs (GPT-2, BLOOM, DistilRoBERTa, ELECTRA, and Mamba, ranging from 70M to 12B parameters) for microbial sequence classification. The models achieved F1 scores up to 95 and operated 16,580x faster and at 2.9x the recall of BLASTP. They effectively classified the algal dark proteome - uncharacterized proteins comprising about 65% of total proteins - validated on new data including a new, complete Hi-C/Pacbio Chlamydomonas genome. Larger (>1B) LA4SR models reached high accuracy (F1 > 86) when trained on less than 2% of available data, rapidly achieving strong generalization capacity. High accuracy was achieved when training data had intact or scrambled terminal information, demonstrating robust generalization to incomplete sequences. Finally, we provide custom AI explainability software tools for attributing amino acid patterns to AI generative processes and interpret their outputs in evolutionary and biophysical contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoxi Zhang, Yueliang Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) provides highly detailed three-dimensional (3D) medical images but is costly, time-consuming, and often inaccessible in intraoperative settings (Organization et al. 2011). Recent advancements have explored reconstructing 3D chest volumes from sparse 2D X-rays, such as single-view or orthogonal double-view images. However, current models tend to process 2D images in a planar manner, prioritizing visual realism over structural accuracy. In this work, we introduce DuoLift Generative Adversarial Networks (DuoLift-GAN), a novel architecture with dual branches that independently elevate 2D images and their features into 3D representations. These 3D outputs are merged into a unified 3D feature map and decoded into a complete 3D chest volume, enabling richer 3D information capture. We also present a masked loss function that directs reconstruction towards critical anatomical regions, improving structural accuracy and visual quality. This paper demonstrates that DuoLift-GAN significantly enhances reconstruction accuracy while achieving superior visual realism compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling has garnered significant attention from the research community, largely due to the substantial advancements of the o1 model released by OpenAI. By allocating more computational resources during the inference phase, large language models~(LLMs) can extensively explore the solution space by generating more thought tokens or diverse solutions, thereby producing more accurate responses. However, developing an o1-like reasoning approach is challenging, and researchers have been making various attempts to advance this open area of research. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration into enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs through reward-guided tree search algorithms. This framework is implemented by integrating the policy model, reward model, and search algorithm. It is primarily constructed around a tree search algorithm, where the policy model navigates a dynamically expanding tree guided by a specially trained reward model. We thoroughly explore various design considerations necessary for implementing this framework and provide a detailed report of the technical aspects. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we focus on mathematical reasoning tasks and conduct extensive evaluations on four challenging datasets, significantly enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinming Xing, Ruilin Xing, Yan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by delivering state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks. Among these, Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT rely on pooling layers to aggregate token-level embeddings into sentence-level representations. Common pooling mechanisms such as Mean, Max, and Weighted Sum play a pivotal role in this aggregation process. Despite their widespread use, the comparative performance of these strategies on different LLM architectures remains underexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates the effects of these pooling mechanisms on two prominent LLM families -- BERT and GPT, in the context of sentence-level sentiment analysis. Comprehensive experiments reveal that each pooling mechanism exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses depending on the task's specific requirements. Our findings underline the importance of selecting pooling methods tailored to the demands of particular applications, prompting a re-evaluation of common assumptions regarding pooling operations. By offering actionable insights, this study contributes to the optimization of LLM-based models for downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In 2023, 58.0% of the African population experienced moderate to severe food insecurity, with 21.6% facing severe food insecurity. Land-use and land-cover maps provide crucial insights for addressing food insecurity by improving agricultural efforts, including mapping and monitoring crop types and estimating yield. The development of global land-cover maps has been facilitated by the increasing availability of earth observation data and advancements in geospatial machine learning. However, these global maps exhibit lower accuracy and inconsistencies in Africa, partly due to the lack of representative training data. To address this issue, we propose a data-centric framework with a teacher-student model setup, which uses diverse data sources of satellite images and label examples to produce local land-cover maps. Our method trains a high-resolution teacher model on images with a resolution of 0.331 m/pixel and a low-resolution student model on publicly available images with a resolution of 10 m/pixel. The student model also utilizes the teacher model's output as its weak label examples through knowledge transfer. We evaluated our framework using Murang'a county in Kenya, renowned for its agricultural productivity, as a use case. Our local models achieved higher quality maps, with improvements of 0.14 in the F1 score and 0.21 in Intersection-over-Union, compared to the best global model. Our evaluation also revealed inconsistencies in existing global maps, with a maximum agreement rate of 0.30 among themselves. Our work provides valuable guidance to decision-makers for driving informed decisions to enhance food security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henan Sun, Xunkai Li, Daohan Su, Junyi Han, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant advances in processing structured data. However, most of them primarily adopted a model-centric approach, which simplifies graphs by converting them into undirected formats and emphasizes model designs. This approach is inherently limited in real-world applications due to the unavoidable information loss in simple undirected graphs and the model optimization challenges that arise when exceeding the upper bounds of this sub-optimal data representational capacity. As a result, there has been a shift toward data-centric methods that prioritize improving graph quality and representation. Specifically, various types of graphs can be derived from naturally structured data, including heterogeneous graphs, hypergraphs, and directed graphs. Among these, directed graphs offer distinct advantages in topological systems by modeling causal relationships, and directed GNNs have been extensively studied in recent years. However, a comprehensive survey of this emerging topic is still lacking. Therefore, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of directed graph learning, with a particular focus on a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first introduce a novel taxonomy for existing studies. Subsequently, we re-examine these methods from the data-centric perspective, with an emphasis on understanding and improving data representation. It demonstrates that a deep understanding of directed graphs and their quality plays a crucial role in model performance. Additionally, we explore the diverse applications of directed GNNs across 10+ domains, highlighting their broad applicability. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges within the field, offering insights that can guide future research and development in directed graph learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been well-researched in many long-context tasks. However, due to high annotation costs, high-quality long-context summary datasets for training or evaluation are scarce, limiting further research. In this work, we introduce CNNSum, a new multi-scale Chinese long-context novel summarization benchmark, including four subsets, length covering 16k to 128k, 695 samples in total, the annotations are human-driven. We evaluate commercial and open-source models on CNNSum and conduct a detailed analysis. Based on the observations, we further conduct fine-tuning exploration with short-context summary data. In our study: (1) GPT-4o underperformed, due to excessive subjective commentary. (2) Currently, long-context summarization mainly relies on memory ability, small LLMs with stable longer context lengths are the most cost-effective. Using long data concatenated from short-context summaries makes a significant improvement. (3) Prompt templates may cause a large performance gap but can be mitigated through fine-tuning. (4) Fine-tuned Chat or Instruction versions may harm the Base model and further fine-tuning cannot bridge performance gap. (5) while models with RoPE base scaling exhibit strong extrapolation potential, their performance may vary significantly when combined with other interpolation methods and need careful selection. (6) CNNSum provides more reliable and insightful evaluation results than other benchmarks. We release CNNSum to advance research in this field (https://github.com/CxsGhost/CNNSum).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dung Thuy Nguyen, Ngoc N. Tran, Taylor T. Johnson, Kevin Leach</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rise of machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity has brought new challenges, including the increasing threat of backdoor poisoning attacks on ML malware classifiers. For instance, adversaries could inject malicious samples into public malware repositories, contaminating the training data and potentially misclassifying malware by the ML model. Current countermeasures predominantly focus on detecting poisoned samples by leveraging disagreements within the outputs of a diverse set of ensemble models on training data points. However, these methods are not suitable for scenarios where Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) is used or when users aim to remove backdoors from a model after it has been trained. Addressing this scenario, we introduce PBP, a post-training defense for malware classifiers that mitigates various types of backdoor embeddings without assuming any specific backdoor embedding mechanism. Our method exploits the influence of backdoor attacks on the activation distribution of neural networks, independent of the trigger-embedding method. In the presence of a backdoor attack, the activation distribution of each layer is distorted into a mixture of distributions. By regulating the statistics of the batch normalization layers, we can guide a backdoored model to perform similarly to a clean one. Our method demonstrates substantial advantages over several state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by experiments on two datasets, two types of backdoor methods, and various attack configurations. Notably, our approach requires only a small portion of the training data -- only 1\% -- to purify the backdoor and reduce the attack success rate from 100\% to almost 0\%, a 100-fold improvement over the baseline methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kasra Arabi, Benjamin Feuer, R. Teal Witter, Chinmay Hegde, Niv Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques.
  In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lening Wang, Wenzhao Zheng, Dalong Du, Yunpeng Zhang, Yilong Ren, Han Jiang, Zhiyong Cui, Haiyang Yu, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 4D driving simulation is essential for developing realistic autonomous driving simulators. Despite advancements in existing methods for generating driving scenes, significant challenges remain in view transformation and spatial-temporal dynamic modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a Spatial-Temporal simulAtion for drivinG (Stag-1) model to reconstruct real-world scenes and design a controllable generative network to achieve 4D simulation. Stag-1 constructs continuous 4D point cloud scenes using surround-view data from autonomous vehicles. It decouples spatial-temporal relationships and produces coherent keyframe videos. Additionally, Stag-1 leverages video generation models to obtain photo-realistic and controllable 4D driving simulation videos from any perspective. To expand the range of view generation, we train vehicle motion videos based on decomposed camera poses, enhancing modeling capabilities for distant scenes. Furthermore, we reconstruct vehicle camera trajectories to integrate 3D points across consecutive views, enabling comprehensive scene understanding along the temporal dimension. Following extensive multi-level scene training, Stag-1 can simulate from any desired viewpoint and achieve a deep understanding of scene evolution under static spatial-temporal conditions. Compared to existing methods, our approach shows promising performance in multi-view scene consistency, background coherence, and accuracy, and contributes to the ongoing advancements in realistic autonomous driving simulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kavindu Ravishan, D\'aniel Szab\'o, Niels van Berkel, Aku Visuri, Chi-Lan Yang, Koji Yatani, Simo Hosio</p>
<p>Abstract: Online reviews help people make better decisions. Review platforms usually depend on typed input, where leaving a good review requires significant effort because users must carefully organize and articulate their thoughts. This may discourage users from leaving comprehensive and high-quality reviews, especially when they are on the go. To address this challenge, we developed Vocalizer, a mobile application that enables users to provide reviews through voice input, with enhancements from a large language model (LLM). In a longitudinal study, we analysed user interactions with the app, focusing on AI-driven features that help refine and improve reviews. Our findings show that users frequently utilized the AI agent to add more detailed information to their reviews. We also show how interactive AI features can improve users self-efficacy and willingness to share reviews online. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of integrating AI assistance into review-writing systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The BrowserGym ecosystem addresses the growing need for efficient evaluation and benchmarking of web agents, particularly those leveraging automation and Large Language Models (LLMs) for web interaction tasks. Many existing benchmarks suffer from fragmentation and inconsistent evaluation methodologies, making it challenging to achieve reliable comparisons and reproducible results. BrowserGym aims to solve this by providing a unified, gym-like environment with well-defined observation and action spaces, facilitating standardized evaluation across diverse benchmarks. Combined with AgentLab, a complementary framework that aids in agent creation, testing, and analysis, BrowserGym offers flexibility for integrating new benchmarks while ensuring consistent evaluation and comprehensive experiment management. This standardized approach seeks to reduce the time and complexity of developing web agents, supporting more reliable comparisons and facilitating in-depth analysis of agent behaviors, and could result in more adaptable, capable agents, ultimately accelerating innovation in LLM-driven automation. As a supporting evidence, we conduct the first large-scale, multi-benchmark web agent experiment and compare the performance of 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across all benchmarks currently available in BrowserGym. Among other findings, our results highlight a large discrepancy between OpenAI and Anthropic's latests models, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet leading the way on almost all benchmarks, except on vision-related tasks where GPT-4o is superior. Despite these advancements, our results emphasize that building robust and efficient web agents remains a significant challenge, due to the inherent complexity of real-world web environments and the limitations of current models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyang Hou, Jianyuan Liang, Anqi Zhao, Huayi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: As the scale and complexity of spatiotemporal data continue to grow rapidly, the use of geospatial modeling on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform presents dual challenges: improving the coding efficiency of domain experts and enhancing the coding capabilities of interdisciplinary users. To address these challenges and improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in geospatial code generation tasks, we propose a framework for building a geospatial operator knowledge base tailored to the GEE JavaScript API. This framework consists of an operator syntax knowledge table, an operator relationship frequency table, an operator frequent pattern knowledge table, and an operator relationship chain knowledge table. By leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) techniques and frequent itemset mining, we systematically extract operator knowledge from 185,236 real GEE scripts and syntax documentation, forming a structured knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves over 90% accuracy, recall, and F1 score in operator knowledge extraction. When integrated with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy for LLM-based geospatial code generation tasks, the knowledge base improves performance by 20-30%. Ablation studies further quantify the necessity of each knowledge table in the knowledge base construction. This work provides robust support for the advancement and application of geospatial code modeling techniques, offering an innovative approach to constructing domain-specific knowledge bases that enhance the code generation capabilities of LLMs, and fostering the deeper integration of generative AI technologies within the field of geoinformatics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxu Ng, Cheng Lv, Pu Zhao, Wei Niu, Juyi Lin, Minzhou Pan, Yun Liang, Yanzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stable diffusion plays a crucial role in generating high-quality images. However, image generation is time-consuming and memory-intensive. To address this, stable-diffusion.cpp (Sdcpp) emerges as an efficient inference framework to accelerate the diffusion models. Although it is lightweight, the current implementation of ggml_conv_2d operator in Sdcpp is suboptimal, exhibiting both high inference latency and massive memory usage. To address this, in this work, we present an optimized version of Sdcpp leveraging the Winograd algorithm to accelerate 2D convolution operations, which is the primary bottleneck in the pipeline. By analyzing both dependent and independent computation graphs, we exploit the device's locality and parallelism to achieve substantial performance improvements. Our framework delivers correct end-to-end results across various stable diffusion models, including SDv1.4, v1.5, v2.1, SDXL, and SDXL-Turbo. Our evaluation results demonstrate a speedup up to 2.76x for individual convolutional layers and an inference speedup up to 4.79x for the overall image generation process, compared with the original Sdcpp on M1 pro.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06581">EmoSpeech: A Corpus of Emotionally Rich and Contextually Detailed Speech Annotations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizhen Bian, Yubo Zhou, Kaitai Zhang, Xiaohan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in text-to-speech (TTS) technology have significantly improved the quality of generated speech, closely matching the timbre and intonation of the target speaker. However, due to the inherent complexity of human emotional expression, the development of TTS systems capable of controlling subtle emotional differences remains a formidable challenge. Existing emotional speech databases often suffer from overly simplistic labelling schemes that fail to capture a wide range of emotional states, thus limiting the effectiveness of emotion synthesis in TTS applications. To this end, recent efforts have focussed on building databases that use natural language annotations to describe speech emotions. However, these approaches are costly and require more emotional depth to train robust systems. In this paper, we propose a novel process aimed at building databases by systematically extracting emotion-rich speech segments and annotating them with detailed natural language descriptions through a generative model. This approach enhances the emotional granularity of the database and significantly reduces the reliance on costly manual annotations by automatically augmenting the data with high-level language models. The resulting rich database provides a scalable and economically viable solution for developing a more nuanced and dynamic basis for developing emotionally controlled TTS systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Lu, Arunesh Sinha, Pradeep Varakantham</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generating unsafe responses to toxic prompts is a significant issue in their applications. While various efforts aim to address this safety concern, previous approaches often demand substantial human data collection or rely on the less dependable option of using another LLM to generate corrective data. In this paper, we aim to take this problem and overcome limitations of requiring significant high-quality human data. Our method requires only a small set of unsafe responses to toxic prompts, easily obtained from the unsafe LLM itself. By employing a semantic cost combined with a negative Earth Mover Distance (EMD) loss, we guide the LLM away from generating unsafe responses. Additionally, we propose a novel lower bound for EMD loss, enabling more efficient optimization. Our results demonstrate superior performance and data efficiency compared to baselines, and we further examine the nuanced effects of over-alignment and potential degradation of language capabilities when using contrastive data.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06853">Tube Loss: A Novel Approach for Prediction Interval Estimation and probabilistic forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pritam Anand, Tathagata Bandyopadhyay, Suresh Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel loss function, called 'Tube Loss', for simultaneous estimation of bounds of a Prediction Interval (PI) in the regression setup, and also for generating probabilistic forecasts from time series data solving a single optimization problem. The PIs obtained by minimizing the empirical risk based on the Tube Loss are shown to be of better quality than the PIs obtained by the existing methods in the following sense. First, it yields intervals that attain the prespecified confidence level $t \in(0,1)$ asymptotically. A theoretical proof of this fact is given. Secondly, the user is allowed to move the interval up or down by controlling the value of a parameter. This helps the user to choose a PI capturing denser regions of the probability distribution of the response variable inside the interval, and thus, sharpening its width. This is shown to be especially useful when the conditional distribution of the response variable is skewed. Further, the Tube Loss based PI estimation method can trade-off between the coverage and the average width by solving a single optimization problem. It enables further reduction of the average width of PI through re-calibration. Also, unlike a few existing PI estimation methods the gradient descent (GD) method can be used for minimization of empirical risk. Finally, through extensive experimentation, we have shown the efficacy of the Tube Loss based PI estimation in kernel machines, neural networks and deep networks and also for probabilistic forecasting tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Ratner, Elliot Farmer, Brandon Warner, Christopher Douglas, Amaury Lendasse</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing machine learning techniques has always required choosing hyperparameters. This is true whether one uses a classical technique such as a KNN or very modern neural networks such as Deep Learning. Though in many applications, hyperparameters are chosen by hand, automated methods have become increasingly more common. These automated methods have become collectively known as automated machine learning, or AutoML. Several automated selection algorithms have shown similar or improved performance over state-of-the-art methods. This breakthrough has led to the development of cloud-based services like Google AutoML, which is based on Deep Learning and is widely considered to be the industry leader in AutoML services. Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) use a fundamentally different type of neural architecture, producing better results at a significantly discounted computational cost. We benchmark the Extreme AutoML technology against Google's AutoML using several popular classification data sets from the University of California at Irvine's (UCI) repository, and several other data sets, observing significant advantages for Extreme AutoML in accuracy, Jaccard Indices, the variance of Jaccard Indices across classes (i.e. class variance) and training times.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rise of multimodal applications, instruction data has become critical for training multimodal language models capable of understanding complex image-based queries. Existing practices rely on powerful but costly large language models (LLMs) or multimodal language models (MLMs) to produce instruction data. These are often prone to hallucinations, licensing issues and the generation process is often hard to scale and interpret. In this work, we present a programmatic approach that employs scene graphs as symbolic representations of images and human-written programs to systematically synthesize vision-centric instruction data. Our approach ensures the interpretability and controllability of the data generation process and scales efficiently while maintaining factual accuracy. By implementing a suite of 24 single-image, 14 multi-image instruction generators, and a scene graph generation pipeline, we build a scalable, cost-effective system: ProVision which produces diverse question-answer pairs concerning objects, attributes, relations, depth, etc., for any given image. Applied to Visual Genome and DataComp datasets, we generate over 10 million instruction data points, ProVision-10M, and leverage them in both pretraining and instruction tuning stages of MLMs. When adopted in the instruction tuning stage, our single-image instruction data yields up to a 7% improvement on the 2D split and 8% on the 3D split of CVBench, along with a 3% increase in performance on QBench2, RealWorldQA, and MMMU. Our multi-image instruction data leads to an 8% improvement on Mantis-Eval. Incorporation of our data in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages of xGen-MM-4B leads to an averaged improvement of 1.6% across 11 benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid progress that existing automated feedback methods have made in correcting the output of large language models (LLMs), these methods cannot be well applied to the relation extraction (RE) task due to their designated feedback objectives and correction manner. To address this problem, we propose a novel automated feedback framework for RE, which presents a rationale supervisor to verify the rationale and provides re-selected demonstrations as feedback to correct the initial prediction. Specifically, we first design a causal intervention and observation method to collect biased/unbiased rationales for contrastive training the rationale supervisor. Then, we present a verification-feedback-correction procedure to iteratively enhance LLMs' capability of handling the RE task. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods.</p>
