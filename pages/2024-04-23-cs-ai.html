<p><b>Authors:</b> Douglas Rebstock, Christopher Solinas, Nathan R. Sturtevant, Michael Buro</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional search algorithms have issues when applied to games of imperfect information where the number of possible underlying states and trajectories are very large. This challenge is particularly evident in trick-taking card games. While state sampling techniques such as Perfect Information Monte Carlo (PIMC) search has shown success in these contexts, they still have major limitations.
  We present Generative Observation Monte Carlo Tree Search (GO-MCTS), which utilizes MCTS on observation sequences generated by a game specific model. This method performs the search within the observation space and advances the search using a model that depends solely on the agent's observations. Additionally, we demonstrate that transformers are well-suited as the generative model in this context, and we demonstrate a process for iteratively training the transformer via population-based self-play.
  The efficacy of GO-MCTS is demonstrated in various games of imperfect information, such as Hearts, Skat, and "The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine," with promising results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Bidollahkhani, Julian M. Kunkel</p>
<p>Abstract: The landscape of maintenance in distributed systems is rapidly evolving with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Also, as the complexity of computing continuum systems intensifies, the role of AI in predictive maintenance (Pd.M.) becomes increasingly pivotal. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the current state of Pd.M. in the computing continuum, with a focus on the combination of scalable AI technologies. Recognizing the limitations of traditional maintenance practices in the face of increasingly complex and heterogenous computing continuum systems, the study explores how AI, especially machine learning and neural networks, is being used to enhance Pd.M. strategies. The survey encompasses a thorough review of existing literature, highlighting key advancements, methodologies, and case studies in the field. It critically examines the role of AI in improving prediction accuracy for system failures and in optimizing maintenance schedules, thereby contributing to reduced downtime and enhanced system longevity. By synthesizing findings from the latest advancements in the field, the article provides insights into the effectiveness and challenges of implementing AI-driven predictive maintenance. It underscores the evolution of maintenance practices in response to technological advancements and the growing complexity of computing continuum systems. The conclusions drawn from this survey are instrumental for practitioners and researchers in understanding the current landscape and future directions of Pd.M. in distributed systems. It emphasizes the need for continued research and development in this area, pointing towards a trend of more intelligent, efficient, and cost-effective maintenance solutions in the era of AI.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13501">A Survey on the Memory Mechanism of Large Language Model based Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Zhang, Xiaohe Bo, Chen Ma, Rui Li, Xu Chen, Quanyu Dai, Jieming Zhu, Zhenhua Dong, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents have recently attracted much attention from the research and industry communities. Compared with original LLMs, LLM-based agents are featured in their self-evolving capability, which is the basis for solving real-world problems that need long-term and complex agent-environment interactions. The key component to support agent-environment interactions is the memory of the agents. While previous studies have proposed many promising memory mechanisms, they are scattered in different papers, and there lacks a systematical review to summarize and compare these works from a holistic perspective, failing to abstract common and effective designing patterns for inspiring future studies. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive survey on the memory mechanism of LLM-based agents. In specific, we first discuss ''what is'' and ''why do we need'' the memory in LLM-based agents. Then, we systematically review previous studies on how to design and evaluate the memory module. In addition, we also present many agent applications, where the memory module plays an important role. At last, we analyze the limitations of existing work and show important future directions. To keep up with the latest advances in this field, we create a repository at \url{https://github.com/nuster1128/LLM_Agent_Memory_Survey}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ningsheng Zhao, Jia Yuan Yu, Krzysztof Dzieciolowski, Trang Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: Shapley value attribution is an increasingly popular explainable AI (XAI) method, which quantifies the contribution of each feature to the model's output. However, recent work has shown that most existing methods to implement Shapley value attributions have some drawbacks. Due to these drawbacks, the resulting Shapley value attributions may provide biased or unreliable explanations, which fail to correctly capture the true intrinsic relationships between features and model outputs. Moreover, it is difficult to evaluate these explanation errors because the true underlying dependencies between features and model outputs are typically unknown. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the explanation errors of Shapley value attributions by decomposing the explanation error into two components: observation bias and structural bias. We also clarify the underlying causes of these two biases and demonstrate that there is a trade-off between them. Based on this error analysis framework, we develop two novel concepts: over-informative and under-informative explanations. We theoretically analyze the potential over-informativeness and under-informativeness of existing Shapley value attribution methods. Particularly for the widely deployed assumption-based Shapley value attributions, we affirm that they can easily be under-informative due to the distribution drift caused by distributional assumptions. We also propose a measurement tool to quantify the distribution drift that causes such errors.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13567">On the Value of Labeled Data and Symbolic Methods for Hidden Neuron Activation Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhilekha Dalal, Rushrukh Rayan, Adrita Barua, Eugene Y. Vasserman, Md Kamruzzaman Sarker, Pascal Hitzler</p>
<p>Abstract: A major challenge in Explainable AI is in correctly interpreting activations of hidden neurons: accurate interpretations would help answer the question of what a deep learning system internally detects as relevant in the input, demystifying the otherwise black-box nature of deep learning systems. The state of the art indicates that hidden node activations can, in some cases, be interpretable in a way that makes sense to humans, but systematic automated methods that would be able to hypothesize and verify interpretations of hidden neuron activations are underexplored. This is particularly the case for approaches that can both draw explanations from substantial background knowledge, and that are based on inherently explainable (symbolic) methods.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel model-agnostic post-hoc Explainable AI method demonstrating that it provides meaningful interpretations. Our approach is based on using a Wikipedia-derived concept hierarchy with approximately 2 million classes as background knowledge, and utilizes OWL-reasoning-based Concept Induction for explanation generation. Additionally, we explore and compare the capabilities of off-the-shelf pre-trained multimodal-based explainable methods.
  Our results indicate that our approach can automatically attach meaningful class expressions as explanations to individual neurons in the dense layer of a Convolutional Neural Network. Evaluation through statistical analysis and degree of concept activation in the hidden layer show that our method provides a competitive edge in both quantitative and qualitative aspects compared to prior work.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13721">The Framework of a Design Process Language</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Arnulf Hagen</p>
<p>Abstract: The thesis develops a view of design in a concept formation framework and outlines a language to describe both the object of the design and the process of designing. The unknown object at the outset of the design work may be seen as an unknown concept that the designer is to define. Throughout the process, she develops a description of this object by relating it to known concepts. The search stops when the designer is satisfied that the design specification is complete enough to satisfy the requirements from it once built. It is then a collection of propositions that all contribute towards defining the design object - a collection of sentences describing relationships between the object and known concepts. Also, the design process itself may be described by relating known concepts - by organizing known abilities into particular patterns of activation, or mobilization. In view of the demands posed to a language to use in this concept formation process, the framework of a Design Process Language (DPL) is developed. The basis for the language are linguistic categories that act as classes of relations used to combine concepts, containing relations used for describing process and object within the same general system, with some relations being process specific, others being object specific, and with the bulk being used both for process and object description. Another outcome is the distinction of modal relations, or relations describing futurity, possibility, willingness, hypothetical events, and the like. The design process almost always includes aspects such as these, and it is thus necessary for a language facilitating design process description to support such relationships to be constructed. The DPL is argued to be a foundation whereupon to build a language that can be used for enabling computers to be more useful - act more intelligently - in the design process.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13778">Multi-channel Emotion Analysis for Consensus Reaching in Group Movie Recommendation Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Adilet Yerkin, Elnara Kadyrgali, Yerdauit Torekhan, Pakizar Shamoi</p>
<p>Abstract: Watching movies is one of the social activities typically done in groups. Emotion is the most vital factor that affects movie viewers' preferences. So, the emotional aspect of the movie needs to be determined and analyzed for further recommendations. It can be challenging to choose a movie that appeals to the emotions of a diverse group. Reaching an agreement for a group can be difficult due to the various genres and choices. This paper proposes a novel approach to group movie suggestions by examining emotions from three different channels: movie descriptions (text), soundtracks (audio), and posters (image). We employ the Jaccard similarity index to match each participant's emotional preferences to prospective movie choices, followed by a fuzzy inference technique to determine group consensus. We use a weighted integration process for the fusion of emotion scores from diverse data types. Then, group movie recommendation is based on prevailing emotions and viewers' best-loved movies. After determining the recommendations, the group's consensus level is calculated using a fuzzy inference system, taking participants' feedback as input. Participants (n=130) in the survey were provided with different emotion categories and asked to select the emotions best suited for particular movies (n=12). Comparison results between predicted and actual scores demonstrate the efficiency of using emotion detection for this problem (Jaccard similarity index = 0.76). We explored the relationship between induced emotions and movie popularity as an additional experiment, analyzing emotion distribution in 100 popular movies from the TMDB database. Such systems can potentially improve the accuracy of movie recommendation systems and achieve a high level of consensus among participants with diverse preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akira Taniguchi, Ayako Fukawa, Hiroshi Yamakawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial cognition in hippocampal formation is posited to play a crucial role in the development of self-localization techniques for robots. In this paper, we propose a self-localization approach, DEQ-MCL, based on the discrete event queue hypothesis associated with phase precession within the hippocampal formation. Our method effectively estimates the posterior distribution of states, encompassing both past, present, and future states that are organized as a queue. This approach enables the smoothing of the posterior distribution of past states using current observations and the weighting of the joint distribution by considering the feasibility of future states. Our findings indicate that the proposed method holds promise for augmenting self-localization performance in indoor environments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14050">Unlawful Proxy Discrimination: A Framework for Challenging Inherently Discriminatory Algorithms</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hilde Weerts, Aislinn Kelly-Lyth, Reuben Binns, Jeremias Adams-Prassl</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging scholarship suggests that the EU legal concept of direct discrimination - where a person is given different treatment on grounds of a protected characteristic - may apply to various algorithmic decision-making contexts. This has important implications: unlike indirect discrimination, there is generally no 'objective justification' stage in the direct discrimination framework, which means that the deployment of directly discriminatory algorithms will usually be unlawful per se. In this paper, we focus on the most likely candidate for direct discrimination in the algorithmic context, termed inherent direct discrimination, where a proxy is inextricably linked to a protected characteristic. We draw on computer science literature to suggest that, in the algorithmic context, 'treatment on the grounds of' needs to be understood in terms of two steps: proxy capacity and proxy use. Only where both elements can be made out can direct discrimination be said to be `on grounds of' a protected characteristic. We analyse the legal conditions of our proposed proxy capacity and proxy use tests. Based on this analysis, we discuss technical approaches and metrics that could be developed or applied to identify inherent direct discrimination in algorithmic decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Safety and responsibility evaluations of advanced AI models are a critical but developing field of research and practice. In the development of Google DeepMind's advanced AI models, we innovated on and applied a broad set of approaches to safety evaluation. In this report, we summarise and share elements of our evolving approach as well as lessons learned for a broad audience. Key lessons learned include: First, theoretical underpinnings and frameworks are invaluable to organise the breadth of risk domains, modalities, forms, metrics, and goals. Second, theory and practice of safety evaluation development each benefit from collaboration to clarify goals, methods and challenges, and facilitate the transfer of insights between different stakeholders and disciplines. Third, similar key methods, lessons, and institutions apply across the range of concerns in responsibility and safety - including established and emerging harms. For this reason it is important that a wide range of actors working on safety evaluation and safety research communities work together to develop, refine and implement novel evaluation approaches and best practices, rather than operating in silos. The report concludes with outlining the clear need to rapidly advance the science of evaluations, to integrate new evaluations into the development and governance of AI, to establish scientifically-grounded norms and standards, and to promote a robust evaluation ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonard Bereska, Efstratios Gavves</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding AI systems' inner workings is critical for ensuring value alignment and safety. This review explores mechanistic interpretability: reverse-engineering the computational mechanisms and representations learned by neural networks into human-understandable algorithms and concepts to provide a granular, causal understanding. We establish foundational concepts such as features encoding knowledge within neural activations and hypotheses about their representation and computation. We survey methodologies for causally dissecting model behaviors and assess the relevance of mechanistic interpretability to AI safety. We investigate challenges surrounding scalability, automation, and comprehensive interpretation. We advocate for clarifying concepts, setting standards, and scaling techniques to handle complex models and behaviors and expand to domains such as vision and reinforcement learning. Mechanistic interpretability could help prevent catastrophic outcomes as AI systems become more powerful and inscrutable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Yin, Potyka Nico, Francesca Toni</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantitatively explaining the strength of arguments under gradual semantics has recently received increasing attention. Specifically, several works in the literature provide quantitative explanations by computing the attribution scores of arguments. These works disregard the importance of attacks and supports, even though they play an essential role when explaining arguments' strength. In this paper, we propose a novel theory of Relation Attribution Explanations (RAEs), adapting Shapley values from game theory to offer fine-grained insights into the role of attacks and supports in quantitative bipolar argumentation towards obtaining the arguments' strength. We show that RAEs satisfy several desirable properties. We also propose a probabilistic algorithm to approximate RAEs efficiently. Finally, we show the application value of RAEs in fraud detection and large language models case studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tamar Rott Shaham, Sarah Schwettmann, Franklin Wang, Achyuta Rajaram, Evan Hernandez, Jacob Andreas, Antonio Torralba</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper describes MAIA, a Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent. MAIA is a system that uses neural models to automate neural model understanding tasks like feature interpretation and failure mode discovery. It equips a pre-trained vision-language model with a set of tools that support iterative experimentation on subcomponents of other models to explain their behavior. These include tools commonly used by human interpretability researchers: for synthesizing and editing inputs, computing maximally activating exemplars from real-world datasets, and summarizing and describing experimental results. Interpretability experiments proposed by MAIA compose these tools to describe and explain system behavior. We evaluate applications of MAIA to computer vision models. We first characterize MAIA's ability to describe (neuron-level) features in learned representations of images. Across several trained models and a novel dataset of synthetic vision neurons with paired ground-truth descriptions, MAIA produces descriptions comparable to those generated by expert human experimenters. We then show that MAIA can aid in two additional interpretability tasks: reducing sensitivity to spurious features, and automatically identifying inputs likely to be mis-classified.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human Activity Recognition from body-worn sensor data poses an inherent challenge in capturing spatial and temporal dependencies of time-series signals. In this regard, the existing recurrent or convolutional or their hybrid models for activity recognition struggle to capture spatio-temporal context from the feature space of sensor reading sequence. To address this complex problem, we propose a self-attention based neural network model that foregoes recurrent architectures and utilizes different types of attention mechanisms to generate higher dimensional feature representation used for classification. We performed extensive experiments on four popular publicly available HAR datasets: PAMAP2, Opportunity, Skoda and USC-HAD. Our model achieve significant performance improvement over recent state-of-the-art models in both benchmark test subjects and Leave-one-subject-out evaluation. We also observe that the sensor attention maps produced by our model is able capture the importance of the modality and placement of the sensors in predicting the different activity classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Zeng, William Watson, Nicole Cho, Saba Rahimi, Shayleen Reynolds, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapidly evolving field of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has made significant strides in automating repetitive processes, yet its effectiveness diminishes in scenarios requiring spontaneous or unpredictable tasks demanded by users. This paper introduces a novel approach, FlowMind, leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), to address this limitation and create an automatic workflow generation system. In FlowMind, we propose a generic prompt recipe for a lecture that helps ground LLM reasoning with reliable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). With this, FlowMind not only mitigates the common issue of hallucinations in LLMs, but also eliminates direct interaction between LLMs and proprietary data or code, thus ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of information - a cornerstone in financial services. FlowMind further simplifies user interaction by presenting high-level descriptions of auto-generated workflows, enabling users to inspect and provide feedback effectively. We also introduce NCEN-QA, a new dataset in finance for benchmarking question-answering tasks from N-CEN reports on funds. We used NCEN-QA to evaluate the performance of workflows generated by FlowMind against baseline and ablation variants of FlowMind. We demonstrate the success of FlowMind, the importance of each component in the proposed lecture recipe, and the effectiveness of user interaction and feedback in FlowMind.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Manheim, Sammy Martin, Mark Bailey, Mikhail Samin, Ross Greutzmacher</p>
<p>Abstract: Auditing of AI systems is a promising way to understand and manage ethical problems and societal risks associated with contemporary AI systems, as well as some anticipated future risks. Efforts to develop standards for auditing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have therefore understandably gained momentum. However, we argue that creating auditing standards is not just insufficient, but actively harmful by proliferating unheeded and inconsistent standards, especially in light of the rapid evolution and ethical and safety challenges of AI. Instead, the paper proposes the establishment of an AI Audit Standards Board, responsible for developing and updating auditing methods and standards in line with the evolving nature of AI technologies. Such a body would ensure that auditing practices remain relevant, robust, and responsive to the rapid advancements in AI. The paper argues that such a governance structure would also be helpful for maintaining public trust in AI and for promoting a culture of safety and ethical responsibility within the AI industry.
  Throughout the paper, we draw parallels with other industries, including safety-critical industries like aviation and nuclear energy, as well as more prosaic ones such as financial accounting and pharmaceuticals. AI auditing should emulate those fields, and extend beyond technical assessments to include ethical considerations and stakeholder engagement, but we explain that this is not enough; emulating other fields' governance mechanisms for these processes, and for audit standards creation, is a necessity. We also emphasize the importance of auditing the entire development process of AI systems, not just the final products...</p>

Empirical experiments evaluate the effectiveness of the learning and decomposition paradigms on FPGA placement tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaneng Li, Cheng Zeng, Jialun Zhong, Ruoyu Zhang, Minhao Zhang, Lei Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulated Patients (SPs) play a crucial role in clinical medical education by providing realistic scenarios for student practice. However, the high cost of training and hiring qualified SPs, along with the heavy workload and potential risks they face in consistently portraying actual patients, limit students' access to this type of clinical training. Consequently, the integration of computer program-based simulated patients has emerged as a valuable educational tool in recent years. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their exceptional capabilities in conversational artificial intelligence and role-playing have been demonstrated, making them a feasible option for implementing Virtual Simulated Patient (VSP). In this paper, we present an integrated model-agnostic framework called CureFun that harnesses the potential of LLMs in clinical medical education. This framework facilitates natural conversations between students and simulated patients, evaluates their dialogue, and provides suggestions to enhance students' clinical inquiry skills. Through comprehensive evaluations, our approach demonstrates more authentic and professional SP-scenario dialogue flows compared to other LLM-based chatbots, thus proving its proficiency in simulating patients. Additionally, leveraging CureFun's evaluation ability, we assess several medical LLMs and discuss the possibilities and limitations of using LLMs as virtual doctors from the perspective of their diagnostic abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feihu Jiang, Chuan Qin, Jingshuai Zhang, Kaichun Yao, Xi Chen, Dazhong Shen, Chen Zhu, Hengshu Zhu, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: In the contemporary era of widespread online recruitment, resume understanding has been widely acknowledged as a fundamental and crucial task, which aims to extract structured information from resume documents automatically. Compared to the traditional rule-based approaches, the utilization of recently proposed pre-trained document understanding models can greatly enhance the effectiveness of resume understanding. The present approaches have, however, disregarded the hierarchical relations within the structured information presented in resumes, and have difficulty parsing resumes in an efficient manner. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel model, namely ERU, to achieve efficient resume understanding. Specifically, we first introduce a layout-aware multi-modal fusion transformer for encoding the segments in the resume with integrated textual, visual, and layout information. Then, we design three self-supervised tasks to pre-train this module via a large number of unlabeled resumes. Next, we fine-tune the model with a multi-granularity sequence labeling task to extract structured information from resumes. Finally, extensive experiments on a real-world dataset clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of ERU.</p>

<p>Abstract: We recently reported evidence that large language models are capable of solving a wide range of text-based analogy problems in a zero-shot manner, indicating the presence of an emergent capacity for analogical reasoning. Two recent commentaries have challenged these results, citing evidence from so-called `counterfactual' tasks in which the standard sequence of the alphabet is arbitrarily permuted so as to decrease similarity with materials that may have been present in the language model's training data. Here, we reply to these critiques, clarifying some misunderstandings about the test materials used in our original work, and presenting evidence that language models are also capable of generalizing to these new counterfactual task variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Y. Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the integration of human-like emotions and ethical considerations into Large Language Models (LLMs). We first model eight fundamental human emotions, presented as opposing pairs, and employ collaborative LLMs to reinterpret and express these emotions across a spectrum of intensity. Our focus extends to embedding a latent ethical dimension within LLMs, guided by a novel self-supervised learning algorithm with human feedback (SSHF). This approach enables LLMs to perform self-evaluations and adjustments concerning ethical guidelines, enhancing their capability to generate content that is not only emotionally resonant but also ethically aligned. The methodologies and case studies presented herein illustrate the potential of LLMs to transcend mere text and image generation, venturing into the realms of empathetic interaction and principled decision-making, thereby setting a new precedent in the development of emotionally aware and ethically conscious AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amogh Mannekote</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional generalization is the ability of a model to generalize to complex, previously unseen types of combinations of entities from just having seen the primitives. This type of generalization is particularly relevant to the semantic parsing community for applications such as task-oriented dialogue, text-to-SQL parsing, and information retrieval, as they can harbor infinite complexity. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in a wide range of NLP tasks, unlocking perfect compositional generalization still remains one of the few last unsolved frontiers. The past few years has seen a surge of interest in works that explore the limitations of, methods to improve, and evaluation metrics for compositional generalization capabilities of LLMs for semantic parsing tasks. In this work, we present a literature survey geared at synthesizing recent advances in analysis, methods, and evaluation schemes to offer a starting point for both practitioners and researchers in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arjun Panickssery, Samuel R. Bowman, Shi Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-evaluation using large language models (LLMs) has proven valuable not only in benchmarking but also methods like reward modeling, constitutional AI, and self-refinement. But new biases are introduced due to the same LLM acting as both the evaluator and the evaluatee. One such bias is self-preference, where an LLM evaluator scores its own outputs higher than others' while human annotators consider them of equal quality. But do LLMs actually recognize their own outputs when they give those texts higher scores, or is it just a coincidence? In this paper, we investigate if self-recognition capability contributes to self-preference. We discover that, out of the box, LLMs such as GPT-4 and Llama 2 have non-trivial accuracy at distinguishing themselves from other LLMs and humans. By fine-tuning LLMs, we discover a linear correlation between self-recognition capability and the strength of self-preference bias; using controlled experiments, we show that the causal explanation resists straightforward confounders. We discuss how self-recognition can interfere with unbiased evaluations and AI safety more generally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyung Kim, Jaehyun Nam, Sangwoo Mo, Jongjin Park, Sang-Woo Lee, Minjoon Seo, Jung-Woo Ha, Jinwoo Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in various natural language processing tasks, including question answering (QA) tasks. While incorporating new information with the retrieval of relevant passages is a promising way to improve QA with LLMs, the existing methods often require additional fine-tuning which becomes infeasible with recent LLMs. Augmenting retrieved passages via prompting has the potential to address this limitation, but this direction has been limitedly explored. To this end, we design a simple yet effective framework to enhance open-domain QA (ODQA) with LLMs, based on the summarized retrieval (SuRe). SuRe helps LLMs predict more accurate answers for a given question, which are well-supported by the summarized retrieval that could be viewed as an explicit rationale extracted from the retrieved passages. Specifically, SuRe first constructs summaries of the retrieved passages for each of the multiple answer candidates. Then, SuRe confirms the most plausible answer from the candidate set by evaluating the validity and ranking of the generated summaries. Experimental results on diverse ODQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SuRe, with improvements of up to 4.6% in exact match (EM) and 4.0% in F1 score over standard prompting approaches. SuRe also can be integrated with a broad range of retrieval methods and LLMs. Finally, the generated summaries from SuRe show additional advantages to measure the importance of retrieved passages and serve as more preferred rationales by models and humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuechen Zhang, Zijian Huang, Ege Onur Taga, Carlee Joe-Wong, Samet Oymak, Jiasi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent successes in natural language processing have led to the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) by multiple providers. Each LLM offering has different inference accuracy, monetary cost, and latency, and their accuracy further depends on the exact wording of the question (i.e., the specific prompt). At the same time, users often have a limit on monetary budget and latency to answer all their questions, and they do not know which LLMs to choose for each question to meet their accuracy and long-term budget requirements. To navigate this rich design space, we propose TREACLE (Thrifty Reasoning via Context-Aware LLM and Prompt Selection), a reinforcement learning policy that jointly selects the model and prompting scheme while respecting the user's monetary cost and latency constraints. TREACLE uses the problem context, including question text embeddings (reflecting the type or difficulty of a query) and the response history (reflecting the consistency of previous responses) to make smart decisions. Our evaluations on standard reasoning datasets (GSM8K, CSQA, and LLC ) with various LLMs and prompts show that TREACLE enables cost savings of up to 85% compared to baselines while maintaining high accuracy. Importantly, it provides the user with the ability to gracefully trade off accuracy for cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidong Bai, Toshiharu Sugawara</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning, decentralized execution is a common approach, yet it suffers from the redundant computation problem. This occurs when multiple agents redundantly perform the same or similar computation due to overlapping observations. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel method referred to as locally centralized team transformer (LCTT). LCTT establishes a locally centralized execution framework where selected agents serve as leaders, issuing instructions, while the rest agents, designated as workers, act as these instructions without activating their policy networks. For LCTT, we proposed the team-transformer (T-Trans) architecture that allows leaders to provide specific instructions to each worker, and the leadership shift mechanism that allows agents autonomously decide their roles as leaders or workers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces redundant computation, does not decrease reward levels, and leads to faster learning convergence.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid progress in the field of natural language processing (NLP) systems and the expansion of large language models (LLMs) have opened up numerous opportunities in the field of education and instructional methods. These advancements offer the potential for tailored learning experiences and immediate feedback, all delivered through accessible and cost-effective services. One notable application area for this technological advancement is in the realm of solving mathematical problems. Mathematical problem-solving not only requires the ability to decipher complex problem statements but also the skill to perform precise arithmetic calculations at each step of the problem-solving process. However, the evaluation of the arithmetic capabilities of large language models remains an area that has received relatively little attention. In response, we introduce an extensive mathematics dataset called "MathQuest" sourced from the 11th and 12th standard Mathematics NCERT textbooks. This dataset encompasses mathematical challenges of varying complexity and covers a wide range of mathematical concepts. Utilizing this dataset, we conduct fine-tuning experiments with three prominent LLMs: LLaMA-2, WizardMath, and MAmmoTH. These fine-tuned models serve as benchmarks for evaluating their performance on our dataset. Our experiments reveal that among the three models, MAmmoTH-13B emerges as the most proficient, achieving the highest level of competence in solving the presented mathematical problems. Consequently, MAmmoTH-13B establishes itself as a robust and dependable benchmark for addressing NCERT mathematics problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image reconstruction is an essential step of every medical imaging method, including Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT), which is a promising modality of imaging, that unites the benefits of both ultrasound and optical imaging methods. Reconstruction of PAT images using conventional methods results in rough artifacts, especially when applied directly to sparse PAT data. In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown a powerful performance in image generation as well as translation, rendering them a smart choice to be applied to reconstruction tasks. In this study, we proposed an end-to-end method called DensePANet to solve the problem of PAT image reconstruction from sparse data. The proposed model employs a novel modification of UNet in its generator, called FD-UNet++, which considerably improves the reconstruction performance. We evaluated the method on various in-vivo and simulated datasets. Quantitative and qualitative results show the better performance of our model over other prevalent deep learning techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Depression is a significant issue nowadays. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2023, over 280 million individuals are grappling with depression. This is a huge number; if not taken seriously, these numbers will increase rapidly. About 4.89 billion individuals are social media users. People express their feelings and emotions on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, etc. These platforms contain valuable information which can be used for research purposes. Considerable research has been conducted across various social media platforms. However, certain limitations persist in these endeavors. Particularly, previous studies were only focused on detecting depression and the intensity of depression in tweets. Also, there existed inaccuracies in dataset labeling. In this research work, five types of depression (Bipolar, major, psychotic, atypical, and postpartum) were predicted using tweets from the Twitter database based on lexicon labeling. Explainable AI was used to provide reasoning by highlighting the parts of tweets that represent type of depression. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was used for feature extraction and training. Machine learning and deep learning methodologies were used to train the model. The BERT model presented the most promising results, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.96.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Kou</p>
<p>Abstract: Two goals - improving replicability and accountability of Machine Learning research respectively, have accrued much attention from the AI ethics and the Machine Learning community. Despite sharing the measures of improving transparency, the two goals are discussed in different registers - replicability registers with scientific reasoning whereas accountability registers with ethical reasoning. Given the existing challenge of the Responsibility Gap - holding Machine Learning scientists accountable for Machine Learning harms due to them being far from sites of application, this paper posits that reconceptualizing replicability can help bridge the gap. Through a shift from model performance replicability to claim replicability, Machine Learning scientists can be held accountable for producing non-replicable claims that are prone to eliciting harm due to misuse and misinterpretation. In this paper, I make the following contributions. First, I define and distinguish two forms of replicability for ML research that can aid constructive conversations around replicability. Second, I formulate an argument for claim-replicability's advantage over model performance replicability in justifying assigning accountability to Machine Learning scientists for producing non-replicable claims and show how it enacts a sense of responsibility that is actionable. In addition, I characterize the implementation of claim replicability as more of a social project than a technical one by discussing its competing epistemological principles, practical implications on Circulating Reference, Interpretative Labor, and research communication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence supports healthcare professionals with predictive modeling, greatly transforming clinical decision-making. This study addresses the crucial need for fairness and explainability in AI applications within healthcare to ensure equitable outcomes across diverse patient demographics. By focusing on the predictive modeling of sepsis-related mortality, we propose a method that learns a performance-optimized predictive model and then employs the transfer learning process to produce a model with better fairness. Our method also introduces a novel permutation-based feature importance algorithm aiming at elucidating the contribution of each feature in enhancing fairness on predictions. Unlike existing explainability methods concentrating on explaining feature contribution to predictive performance, our proposed method uniquely bridges the gap in understanding how each feature contributes to fairness. This advancement is pivotal, given sepsis's significant mortality rate and its role in one-third of hospital deaths. Our method not only aids in identifying and mitigating biases within the predictive model but also fosters trust among healthcare stakeholders by improving the transparency and fairness of model predictions, thereby contributing to more equitable and trustworthy healthcare delivery.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the energy landscape evolves toward sustainability, the accelerating integration of distributed energy resources poses challenges to the operability and reliability of the electricity grid. One significant aspect of this issue is the notable increase in net load variability at the grid edge. Transactive energy, implemented through local energy markets, has recently garnered attention as a promising solution to address the grid challenges in the form of decentralized, indirect demand response on a community level. Given the nature of these challenges, model-free control approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning, show promise for the decentralized automation of participation within this context. Existing studies at the intersection of transactive energy and model-free control primarily focus on socioeconomic and self-consumption metrics, overlooking the crucial goal of reducing community-level net load variability. This study addresses this gap by training a set of deep reinforcement learning agents to automate end-user participation in ALEX, an economy-driven local energy market. In this setting, agents do not share information and only prioritize individual bill optimization. The study unveils a clear correlation between bill reduction and reduced net load variability in this setup. The impact on net load variability is assessed over various time horizons using metrics such as ramping rate, daily and monthly load factor, as well as daily average and total peak export and import on an open-source dataset. Agents are then benchmarked against several baselines, with their performance levels showing promising results, approaching those of a near-optimal dynamic programming benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have encouraged their adoption in the healthcare domain where vital clinical information is often contained in unstructured notes. Cancer staging status is available in clinical reports, but it requires natural language processing to extract the status from the unstructured text. With the advance in clinical-oriented LLMs, it is promising to extract such status without extensive efforts in training the algorithms. Prompting approaches of the pre-trained LLMs that elicit a model's reasoning process, such as chain-of-thought, may help to improve the trustworthiness of the generated responses. Using self-consistency further improves model performance, but often results in inconsistent generations across the multiple reasoning paths. In this study, we propose an ensemble reasoning approach with the aim of improving the consistency of the model generations. Using an open access clinical large language model to determine the pathologic cancer stage from real-world pathology reports, we show that the ensemble reasoning approach is able to improve both the consistency and performance of the LLM in determining cancer stage, thereby demonstrating the potential to use these models in clinical or other domains where reliability and trustworthiness are critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Zhang, Xiaoxiao Ma, Jia Wu, Jian Yang, Hao Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Fake news is pervasive on social media, inflicting substantial harm on public discourse and societal well-being. We investigate the explicit structural information and textual features of news pieces by constructing a heterogeneous graph concerning the relations among news topics, entities, and content. Through our study, we reveal that fake news can be effectively detected in terms of the atypical heterogeneous subgraphs centered on them, which encapsulate the essential semantics and intricate relations between news elements. However, suffering from the heterogeneity, exploring such heterogeneous subgraphs remains an open problem. To bridge the gap, this work proposes a heterogeneous subgraph transformer (HeteroSGT) to exploit subgraphs in our constructed heterogeneous graph. In HeteroSGT, we first employ a pre-trained language model to derive both word-level and sentence-level semantics. Then the random walk with restart (RWR) is applied to extract subgraphs centered on each news, which are further fed to our proposed subgraph Transformer to quantify the authenticity. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HeteroSGT over five baselines. Further case and ablation studies validate our motivation and demonstrate that performance improvement stems from our specially designed components.</p>

However, data augmentation exposes machine learning models to privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks. In this paper, we propose an effective combination of data augmentation and machine unlearning, which can reduce data bias while providing a provable defense against known attacks. Specifically, we maintain the fairness of the trained model with diffusion-based data augmentation, and then utilize multi-shard unlearning to remove identifying information of original data from the ML model for protection against privacy attacks. Experimental evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach can achieve significant improvements in bias reduction as well as robustness against state-of-the-art privacy attacks.</p>

Similar to physical thermodynamic systems which are characterized by energy and entropy, ML systems possess these characteristics as well. This comparison inspire us to integrate the concept of temperature into ML systems grounded in the fundamental principles of thermodynamics, and establish a basic thermodynamic framework for machine learning systems with non-Boltzmann distributions. We introduce the concept of states within a ML system, identify two typical types of state, and interpret model training and refresh as a process of state phase transition. We consider that the initial potential energy of a ML system is described by the model's loss functions, and the energy adheres to the principle of minimum potential energy. For a variety of energy forms and parameter initialization methods, we derive the temperature of systems during the phase transition both analytically and asymptotically, highlighting temperature as a vital indicator of system data distribution and ML training complexity. Moreover, we perceive deep neural networks as complex heat engines with both global temperature and local temperatures in each layer. The concept of work efficiency is introduced within neural networks, which mainly depends on the neural activation functions. We then classify neural networks based on their work efficiency, and describe neural networks as two types of heat engines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their deployment in wireless networks still face challenges, i.e., a lack of privacy and security protection mechanisms. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to address these challenges. Yet, it suffers from issues including inefficient handling with big and heterogeneous data, resource-intensive training, and high communication overhead. To tackle these issues, we first compare different learning stages and their features of LLMs in wireless networks. Next, we introduce two personalized wireless federated fine-tuning methods with low communication overhead, i.e., (1) Personalized Federated Instruction Tuning (PFIT), which employs reinforcement learning to fine-tune local LLMs with diverse reward models to achieve personalization; (2) Personalized Federated Task Tuning (PFTT), which can leverage global adapters and local Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) to collaboratively fine-tune local LLMs, where the local LoRAs can be applied to achieve personalization without aggregation. Finally, we perform simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two methods and comprehensively discuss open issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guohao Wang, Ting Liu, Hongqiang Lyu, Ze Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: As a prevalent and dynamically regulated epigenetic modification, 5-formylcytidine (f5C) is crucial in various biological processes. However, traditional experimental methods for f5C detection are often laborious and time-consuming, limiting their ability to map f5C sites across the transcriptome comprehensively. While computational approaches offer a cost-effective and high-throughput alternative, no recognition model for f5C has been developed to date. Drawing inspiration from language models in natural language processing, this study presents f5C-finder, an ensemble neural network-based model utilizing multi-head attention for the identification of f5C. Five distinct feature extraction methods were employed to construct five individual artificial neural networks, and these networks were subsequently integrated through ensemble learning to create f5C-finder. 10-fold cross-validation and independent tests demonstrate that f5C-finder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with AUC of 0.807 and 0.827, respectively. The result highlights the effectiveness of biological language model in capturing both the order (sequential) and functional meaning (semantics) within genomes. Furthermore, the built-in interpretability allows us to understand what the model is learning, creating a bridge between identifying key sequential elements and a deeper exploration of their biological functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Doga Dogan, Eric J. Gonzalez, Andrea Colaco, Karan Ahuja, Ruofei Du, Johnny Lee, Mar Gonzalez-Franco, David Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Seamless integration of physical objects as interactive digital entities remains a challenge for spatial computing. This paper introduces Augmented Object Intelligence (AOI), a novel XR interaction paradigm designed to blur the lines between digital and physical by endowing real-world objects with the ability to interact as if they were digital, where every object has the potential to serve as a portal to vast digital functionalities. Our approach utilizes object segmentation and classification, combined with the power of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to facilitate these interactions. We implement the AOI concept in the form of XR-Objects, an open-source prototype system that provides a platform for users to engage with their physical environment in rich and contextually relevant ways. This system enables analog objects to not only convey information but also to initiate digital actions, such as querying for details or executing tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we define the AOI concept and detail its advantages over traditional AI assistants, (2) detail the XR-Objects system's open-source design and implementation, and (3) show its versatility through a variety of use cases and a user study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmadreza Eslaminia, Yuquan Meng, Klara Nahrstedt, Chenhui Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasonic metal welding (UMW) is a key joining technology with widespread industrial applications. Condition monitoring (CM) capabilities are critically needed in UMW applications because process anomalies significantly deteriorate the joining quality. Recently, machine learning models emerged as a promising tool for CM in many manufacturing applications due to their ability to learn complex patterns. Yet, the successful deployment of these models requires substantial training data that may be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Additionally, many existing machine learning models lack generalizability and cannot be directly applied to new process configurations (i.e., domains). Such issues may be potentially alleviated by pooling data across manufacturers, but data sharing raises critical data privacy concerns. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Federated Transfer Learning with Task Personalization (FTL-TP) framework that provides domain generalization capabilities in distributed learning while ensuring data privacy. By effectively learning a unified representation from feature space, FTL-TP can adapt CM models for clients working on similar tasks, thereby enhancing their overall adaptability and performance jointly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FTL-TP, we investigate two distinct UMW CM tasks, tool condition monitoring and workpiece surface condition classification. Compared with state-of-the-art FL algorithms, FTL-TP achieves a 5.35%--8.08% improvement of accuracy in CM in new target domains. FTL-TP is also shown to perform excellently in challenging scenarios involving unbalanced data distributions and limited client fractions. Furthermore, by implementing the FTL-TP method on an edge-cloud architecture, we show that this method is both viable and efficient in practice. The FTL-TP framework is readily extensible to various other manufacturing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khuyagbaatar Batsuren, Ekaterina Vylomova, Verna Dankers, Tsetsuukhei Delgerbaatar, Omri Uzan, Yuval Pinter, G\'abor Bella</p>
<p>Abstract: The popular subword tokenizers of current language models, such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), are known not to respect morpheme boundaries, which affects the downstream performance of the models. While many improved tokenization algorithms have been proposed, their evaluation and cross-comparison is still an open problem. As a solution, we propose a combined intrinsic-extrinsic evaluation framework for subword tokenization. Intrinsic evaluation is based on our new UniMorph Labeller tool that classifies subword tokenization as either morphological or alien. Extrinsic evaluation, in turn, is performed via the Out-of-Vocabulary Generalization Challenge 1.0 benchmark, which consists of three newly specified downstream text classification tasks. Our empirical findings show that the accuracy of UniMorph Labeller is 98%, and that, in all language models studied (including ALBERT, BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa), alien tokenization leads to poorer generalizations compared to morphological tokenization for semantic compositionality of word meanings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Xue, Yongxin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial examples for diffusion models are widely used as solutions for safety concerns. By adding adversarial perturbations to personal images, attackers can not edit or imitate them easily. However, it is essential to note that all these protections target the latent diffusion model (LDMs), the adversarial examples for diffusion models in the pixel space (PDMs) are largely overlooked. This may mislead us to think that the diffusion models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks like most deep models. In this paper, we show novel findings that: even though gradient-based white-box attacks can be used to attack the LDMs, they fail to attack PDMs. This finding is supported by extensive experiments of almost a wide range of attacking methods on various PDMs and LDMs with different model structures, which means diffusion models are indeed much more robust against adversarial attacks. We also find that PDMs can be used as an off-the-shelf purifier to effectively remove the adversarial patterns that were generated on LDMs to protect the images, which means that most protection methods nowadays, to some extent, cannot protect our images from malicious attacks. We hope that our insights will inspire the community to rethink the adversarial samples for diffusion models as protection methods and move forward to more effective protection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunxi Li, Tianyu Zhan, Shengyu Zhang, Kun Kuang, Jiwei Li, Zhou Zhao, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we focus on heterogeneous knowledge transfer across entirely different model architectures, tasks, and modalities. Existing knowledge transfer methods (e.g., backbone sharing, knowledge distillation) often hinge on shared elements within model structures or task-specific features/labels, limiting transfers to complex model types or tasks. To overcome these challenges, we present MergeNet, which learns to bridge the gap of parameter spaces of heterogeneous models, facilitating the direct interaction, extraction, and application of knowledge within these parameter spaces. The core mechanism of MergeNet lies in the parameter adapter, which operates by querying the source model's low-rank parameters and adeptly learning to identify and map parameters into the target model. MergeNet is learned alongside both models, allowing our framework to dynamically transfer and adapt knowledge relevant to the current stage, including the training trajectory knowledge of the source model. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous knowledge transfer demonstrate significant improvements in challenging settings, where representative approaches may falter or prove less applicable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ukesh Thapa, Bipun Man Pati, Samit Thapa, Dhiraj Pyakurel, Anup Shrestha</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning techniques has led to their widespread application in various domains including water resources. However, snowmelt modeling remains an area that has not been extensively explored. In this study, we propose a state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning sequential model, leveraging the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), for snowmelt-driven discharge modeling in the Himalayan basin of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conducted a comparative analysis with other popular models including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer. Furthermore, Nested cross-validation (CV) is used with five outer folds and three inner folds, and hyper-parameter tuning is performed on the inner folds. To evaluate the performance of the model mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), R square ($R^{2}$), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) are computed for each outer fold. The average metrics revealed that TCN outperformed the other models, with an average MAE of 0.011, RMSE of 0.023, $R^{2}$ of 0.991, KGE of 0.992, and NSE of 0.991. The findings of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the deep learning model as compared to traditional machine learning approaches for snowmelt-driven streamflow forecasting. Moreover, the superior performance of TCN highlights its potential as a promising deep learning model for similar hydrological applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kefan Li, Yuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Code generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has been extensively studied and achieved remarkable progress. As a complementary aspect to code generation, test case generation is of crucial importance in ensuring the quality and reliability of code. However, using LLMs as test case generators has been much less explored. Current research along this line primarily focuses on enhancing code generation with assistance from test cases generated by LLMs, while the performance of LLMs in test case generation alone has not been comprehensively examined. To bridge this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to study how well LLMs can generate high-quality test cases. We find that as the problem difficulty increases, state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to generate correct test cases, largely due to their inherent limitations in computation and reasoning. To mitigate this issue, we further propose a multi-agent framework called \emph{TestChain} that decouples the generation of test inputs and test outputs. Notably, TestChain uses a ReAct format conversation chain for LLMs to interact with a Python interpreter in order to provide more accurate test outputs. Our results indicate that TestChain outperforms the baseline by a large margin. Particularly, in terms of the accuracy of test cases, TestChain using GPT-4 as the backbone achieves a 13.84\% improvement over the baseline on the LeetCode-hard dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moshe Eliasof, Beatrice Bevilacqua, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb, Haggai Maron</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, significant efforts have been made to refine the design of Graph Neural Network (GNN) layers, aiming to overcome diverse challenges, such as limited expressive power and oversmoothing. Despite their widespread adoption, the incorporation of off-the-shelf normalization layers like BatchNorm or InstanceNorm within a GNN architecture may not effectively capture the unique characteristics of graph-structured data, potentially reducing the expressive power of the overall architecture. Moreover, existing graph-specific normalization layers often struggle to offer substantial and consistent benefits. In this paper, we propose GRANOLA, a novel graph-adaptive normalization layer. Unlike existing normalization layers, GRANOLA normalizes node features by adapting to the specific characteristics of the graph, particularly by generating expressive representations of its neighborhood structure, obtained by leveraging the propagation of Random Node Features (RNF) in the graph. We present theoretical results that support our design choices. Our extensive empirical evaluation of various graph benchmarks underscores the superior performance of GRANOLA over existing normalization techniques. Furthermore, GRANOLA emerges as the top-performing method among all baselines within the same time complexity of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs).</p>

<p>Abstract: Trajectory augmentation serves as a means to mitigate distributional shift in imitation learning. However, imitating trajectories that inadequately represent the original expert data can result in undesirable behaviors, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. We propose a trajectory augmentation method designed to maintain similarity with expert trajectory data. To accomplish this, we first cluster trajectories to identify minority yet safety-critical groups. Then, we combine the trajectories within the same cluster through geometrical transformation to create new trajectories. These trajectories are then added to the training dataset, provided that they meet our specified safety-related criteria. Our experiments exhibit that training an imitation learning model using these augmented trajectories can significantly improve closed-loop performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Consistency models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in facilitating efficient image/video generation, enabling synthesis with minimal sampling steps. It has proven to be advantageous in mitigating the computational burdens associated with diffusion models. Nevertheless, the application of consistency models in music generation remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present Music Consistency Models (\texttt{MusicCM}), which leverages the concept of consistency models to efficiently synthesize mel-spectrogram for music clips, maintaining high quality while minimizing the number of sampling steps. Building upon existing text-to-music diffusion models, the \texttt{MusicCM} model incorporates consistency distillation and adversarial discriminator training. Moreover, we find it beneficial to generate extended coherent music by incorporating multiple diffusion processes with shared constraints. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of our model in terms of computational efficiency, fidelity, and naturalness. Notable, \texttt{MusicCM} achieves seamless music synthesis with a mere four sampling steps, e.g., only one second per minute of the music clip, showcasing the potential for real-time application.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) can play a crucial role in enhancing the accessibility of spoken languages worldwide. In this paper, we build a set of ASR tools for Amharic, a language spoken by more than 50 million people primarily in eastern Africa. Amharic is written in the Ge'ez script, a sequence of graphemes with spacings denoting word boundaries. This makes computational processing of Amharic challenging since the location of spacings can significantly impact the meaning of formed sentences. We find that existing benchmarks for Amharic ASR do not account for these spacings and only measure individual grapheme error rates, leading to significantly inflated measurements of in-the-wild performance. In this paper, we first release corrected transcriptions of existing Amharic ASR test datasets, enabling the community to accurately evaluate progress. Furthermore, we introduce a post-processing approach using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to organize raw ASR outputs into a grammatically complete and semantically meaningful Amharic sentence. Through experiments on the corrected test dataset, our model enhances the semantic correctness of Amharic speech recognition systems, achieving a Character Error Rate (CER) of 5.5\% and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 23.3\%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Information Extraction (IE) is a transformative process that converts unstructured text data into a structured format by employing entity and relation extraction (RE) methodologies. The identification of the relation between a pair of entities plays a crucial role within this framework. Despite the existence of various techniques for relation extraction, their efficacy heavily relies on access to labeled data and substantial computational resources. In addressing these challenges, Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising solutions; however, they might return hallucinating responses due to their own training data. To overcome these limitations, Retrieved-Augmented Generation-based Relation Extraction (RAG4RE) in this work is proposed, offering a pathway to enhance the performance of relation extraction tasks.
  This work evaluated the effectiveness of our RAG4RE approach utilizing different LLMs. Through the utilization of established benchmarks, such as TACRED, TACREV, Re-TACRED, and SemEval RE datasets, our aim is to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of our RAG4RE approach. In particularly, we leverage prominent LLMs including Flan T5, Llama2, and Mistral in our investigation. The results of our study demonstrate that our RAG4RE approach surpasses performance of traditional RE approaches based solely on LLMs, particularly evident in the TACRED dataset and its variations. Furthermore, our approach exhibits remarkable performance compared to previous RE methodologies across both TACRED and TACREV datasets, underscoring its efficacy and potential for advancing RE tasks in natural language processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Intrusion detection is a long standing and crucial problem in security. A system capable of detecting intrusions automatically is on great demand in enterprise security solutions. Existing solutions rely heavily on hand-crafted rules designed by security operators, which suffer from high false negative rates and poor generalization ability to new, zero-day attacks at scale. AI and machine learning offer promising solutions to address the issues, by inspecting abnormal user behaviors intelligently and automatically from data. However, existing learning-based intrusion detection systems in the literature are mostly designed for small data, and they lack the ability to leverage the power of big data in cloud environments. In this paper, we target at this problem and introduce an intrusion detection system which incorporates large-scale pre-training, so as to train a large language model based on tens of millions of command lines for AI-based intrusion detection. Experiments performed on 30 million training samples and 10 million test samples verify the effectiveness of our solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Duchesne, Kaiwen Zhang, Chamseddine Talhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent privacy-preserving technique for enabling use cases like confidential clinical machine learning. FL operates by aggregating models trained by remote devices which owns the data. Thus, FL enables the training of powerful global models using crowd-sourced data from a large number of learners, without compromising their privacy. However, the aggregating server is a single point of failure when generating the global model. Moreover, the performance of the model suffers when the data is not independent and identically distributed (non-IID data) on all remote devices. This leads to vastly different models being aggregated, which can reduce the performance by as much as 50% in certain scenarios.
  In this paper, we seek to address the aforementioned issues while retaining the benefits of FL. We propose MultiConfederated Learning: a decentralized FL framework which is designed to handle non-IID data. Unlike traditional FL, MultiConfederated Learning will maintain multiple models in parallel (instead of a single global model) to help with convergence when the data is non-IID. With the help of transfer learning, learners can converge to fewer models. In order to increase adaptability, learners are allowed to choose which updates to aggregate from their peers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a significant technique for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). With the fast growth of AGI, the security problem become one of the most important challenges for VLMs. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the vulnerability of the conventional adaptation methods for VLMs, which may bring significant security risks. In addition, as the size of the VLMs increases, performing conventional adversarial adaptation techniques on VLMs results in high computational costs. To solve these problems, we propose a parameter-efficient \underline{Adv}ersarial adaptation method named \underline{AdvLoRA} by \underline{Lo}w-\underline{R}ank \underline{A}daptation. At first, we investigate and reveal the intrinsic low-rank property during the adversarial adaptation for VLMs. Different from LoRA, we improve the efficiency and robustness of adversarial adaptation by designing a novel reparameterizing method based on parameter clustering and parameter alignment. In addition, an adaptive parameter update strategy is proposed to further improve the robustness. By these settings, our proposed AdvLoRA alleviates the model security and high resource waste problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the AdvLoRA.</p>

ViT divides an image into several local patches, known as "visual sentences". However, the information contained in the image is vast and complex, and focusing only on the features at the "visual sentence" level is not enough. The features between local patches should also be taken into consideration. In order to achieve further improvement, the TNT model is proposed, whose algorithm further divides the image into smaller patches, namely "visual words," achieving more accurate results. The core of Transformer is the Multi-Head Attention mechanism, and traditional attention mechanisms ignore interactions across different attention heads. In order to reduce redundancy and improve utilization, we introduce the nested algorithm and apply the Nested-TNT to image classification tasks. The experiment confirms that the proposed model has achieved better classification performance over ViT and TNT, exceeding 2.25%, 1.1% on dataset CIFAR10 and 2.78%, 0.25% on dataset FLOWERS102 respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Speth, Nathan Vance, Patrick Flynn, Adam Czajka</p>
<p>Abstract: Subtle periodic signals, such as blood volume pulse and respiration, can be extracted from RGB video, enabling noncontact health monitoring at low cost. Advancements in remote pulse estimation -- or remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) -- are currently driven by deep learning solutions. However, modern approaches are trained and evaluated on benchmark datasets with ground truth from contact-PPG sensors. We present the first non-contrastive unsupervised learning framework for signal regression to mitigate the need for labelled video data. With minimal assumptions of periodicity and finite bandwidth, our approach discovers the blood volume pulse directly from unlabelled videos. We find that encouraging sparse power spectra within normal physiological bandlimits and variance over batches of power spectra is sufficient for learning visual features of periodic signals. We perform the first experiments utilizing unlabelled video data not specifically created for rPPG to train robust pulse rate estimators. Given the limited inductive biases, we successfully applied the same approach to camera-based respiration by changing the bandlimits of the target signal. This shows that the approach is general enough for unsupervised learning of bandlimited quasi-periodic signals from different domains. Furthermore, we show that the framework is effective for finetuning models on unlabelled video from a single subject, allowing for personalized and adaptive signal regressors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Jia, Sian Jin, Jinzhen Wang, Wei Niu, Dingwen Tao, Miao Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of computational capabilities and the ever-growing scale of modern HPC systems present formidable challenges in managing exascale scientific data. Faced with such vast datasets, traditional lossless compression techniques prove insufficient in reducing data size to a manageable level while preserving all information intact. In response, researchers have turned to error-bounded lossy compression methods, which offer a balance between data size reduction and information retention. However, despite their utility, these compressors employing conventional techniques struggle with limited reconstruction quality. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from recent advancements in deep learning and propose GWLZ, a novel group-wise learning-based lossy compression framework with multiple lightweight learnable enhancer models. Leveraging a group of neural networks, GWLZ significantly enhances the decompressed data reconstruction quality with negligible impact on the compression efficiency. Experimental results on different fields from the Nyx dataset demonstrate remarkable improvements by GWLZ, achieving up to 20% quality enhancements with negligible overhead as low as 0.0003x.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyao Shi, Jianing Qian, Yecheng Jason Ma, Dinesh Jayaraman</p>
<p>Abstract: There have recently been large advances both in pre-training visual representations for robotic control and segmenting unknown category objects in general images. To leverage these for improved robot learning, we propose $\textbf{POCR}$, a new framework for building pre-trained object-centric representations for robotic control. Building on theories of "what-where" representations in psychology and computer vision, we use segmentations from a pre-trained model to stably locate across timesteps, various entities in the scene, capturing "where" information. To each such segmented entity, we apply other pre-trained models that build vector descriptions suitable for robotic control tasks, thus capturing "what" the entity is. Thus, our pre-trained object-centric representations for control are constructed by appropriately combining the outputs of off-the-shelf pre-trained models, with no new training. On various simulated and real robotic tasks, we show that imitation policies for robotic manipulators trained on POCR achieve better performance and systematic generalization than state of the art pre-trained representations for robotics, as well as prior object-centric representations that are typically trained from scratch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhepeng Wang, Yi Sheng, Nirajan Koirala, Kanad Basu, Taeho Jung, Cheng-Chang Lu, Weiwen Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Benefiting from cloud computing, today's early-stage quantum computers can be remotely accessed via the cloud services, known as Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS). However, it poses a high risk of data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML). To run a QML model with QaaS, users need to locally compile their quantum circuits including the subcircuit of data encoding first and then send the compiled circuit to the QaaS provider for execution. If the QaaS provider is untrustworthy, the subcircuit to encode the raw data can be easily stolen. Therefore, we propose a co-design framework for preserving the data security of QML with the QaaS paradigm, namely PristiQ. By introducing an encryption subcircuit with extra secure qubits associated with a user-defined security key, the security of data can be greatly enhanced. And an automatic search algorithm is proposed to optimize the model to maintain its performance on the encrypted quantum data. Experimental results on simulation and the actual IBM quantum computer both prove the ability of PristiQ to provide high security for the quantum data while maintaining the model performance in QML.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kleopatra Markou, Dimitrios Tomaras, Vana Kalogeraki, Dimitrios Gunopulos</p>
<p>Abstract: The imminent need to interpret the output of a Machine Learning model with counterfactual (CF) explanations - via small perturbations to the input - has been notable in the research community. Although the variety of CF examples is important, the aspect of them being feasible at the same time, does not necessarily apply in their entirety. This work uses different benchmark datasets to examine through the preservation of the logical causal relations of their attributes, whether CF examples can be generated after a small amount of changes to the original input, be feasible and actually useful to the end-user in a real-world case. To achieve this, we used a black box model as a classifier, to distinguish the desired from the input class and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate feasible CF examples. As an extension, we also extracted two-dimensional manifolds (one for each dataset) that located the majority of the feasible examples, a representation that adequately distinguished them from infeasible ones. For our experimentation we used three commonly used datasets and we managed to generate feasible and at the same time sparse, CF examples that satisfy all possible predefined causal constraints, by confirming their importance with the attributes in a dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enze Jiang, Jishen Peng, Zheng Ma, Xiong-Bin Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years we have witnessed a growth in mathematics for deep learning, which has been used to solve inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, most deep learning-based inversion methods either require paired data or necessitate retraining neural networks for modifications in the conditions of the inverse problem, significantly reducing the efficiency of inversion and limiting its applicability. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, leveraging the score-based generative diffusion model, we introduce a novel unsupervised inversion methodology tailored for solving inverse problems arising from PDEs. Our approach operates within the Bayesian inversion framework, treating the task of solving the posterior distribution as a conditional generation process achieved through solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of inversion results, we propose an ODE-based Diffusion Posterior Sampling inversion algorithm. The algorithm stems from the marginal probability density functions of two distinct forward generation processes that satisfy the same Fokker-Planck equation. Through a series of experiments involving various PDEs, we showcase the efficiency and robustness of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deddy Jobson, Eddy Hudson</p>
<p>Abstract: Regression is typically treated as a curve-fitting process where the goal is to fit a prediction function to data. With the help of conditional generative adversarial networks, we propose to solve this age-old problem in a different way; we aim to learn a prediction function whose outputs, when paired with the corresponding inputs, are indistinguishable from feature-label pairs in the training dataset. We show that this approach to regression makes fewer assumptions on the distribution of the data we are fitting to and, therefore, has better representation capabilities. We draw parallels with generalized linear models in statistics and show how our proposal serves as an extension of them to neural networks. We demonstrate the superiority of this new approach to standard regression with experiments on multiple synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets, finding encouraging results, especially with real-world heavy-tailed regression datasets. To make our work more reproducible, we release our source code. Link to repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/regressGAN-7B71/</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of deep learning has marked significant progress in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and medical imaging, primarily through the adaptation of pre-trained models for specific tasks. Traditional fine-tuning methods, involving adjustments to all parameters, face challenges due to high computational and memory demands. This has led to the development of Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, which selectively update parameters to balance computational efficiency with performance. This review examines PEFT approaches, offering a detailed comparison of various strategies highlighting applications across different domains, including text generation, medical imaging, protein modeling, and speech synthesis. By assessing the effectiveness of PEFT methods in reducing computational load, speeding up training, and lowering memory usage, this paper contributes to making deep learning more accessible and adaptable, facilitating its wider application and encouraging innovation in model optimization. Ultimately, the paper aims to contribute towards insights into PEFT's evolving landscape, guiding researchers and practitioners in overcoming the limitations of conventional fine-tuning approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhu, Jiachen Liu, Mosharaf Chowdhury, Fan Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train machine learning (ML) models across potentially millions of edge client devices. Yet, training and customizing models for FL clients is notoriously challenging due to the heterogeneity of client data, device capabilities, and the massive scale of clients, making individualized model exploration prohibitively expensive. State-of-the-art FL solutions personalize a globally trained model or concurrently train multiple models, but they often incur suboptimal model accuracy and huge training costs.
  In this paper, we introduce FedTrans, a multi-model FL training framework that automatically produces and trains high-accuracy, hardware-compatible models for individual clients at scale. FedTrans begins with a basic global model, identifies accuracy bottlenecks in model architectures during training, and then employs model transformation to derive new models for heterogeneous clients on the fly. It judiciously assigns models to individual clients while performing soft aggregation on multi-model updates to minimize total training costs. Our evaluations using realistic settings show that FedTrans improves individual client model accuracy by 14% - 72% while slashing training costs by 1.6X - 20X over state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13518">Reliable Model Watermarking: Defending Against Theft without Compromising on Evasion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Zhu, Sichu Liang, Wentao Hu, Fangqi Li, Ju Jia, Shilin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms,safeguarding the intellectual property of deep learning models is becoming paramount. Among various protective measures, trigger set watermarking has emerged as a flexible and effective strategy for preventing unauthorized model distribution. However, this paper identifies an inherent flaw in the current paradigm of trigger set watermarking: evasion adversaries can readily exploit the shortcuts created by models memorizing watermark samples that deviate from the main task distribution, significantly impairing their generalization in adversarial settings. To counteract this, we leverage diffusion models to synthesize unrestricted adversarial examples as trigger sets. By learning the model to accurately recognize them, unique watermark behaviors are promoted through knowledge injection rather than error memorization, thus avoiding exploitable shortcuts. Furthermore, we uncover that the resistance of current trigger set watermarking against removal attacks primarily relies on significantly damaging the decision boundaries during embedding, intertwining unremovability with adverse impacts. By optimizing the knowledge transfer properties of protected models, our approach conveys watermark behaviors to extraction surrogates without aggressively decision boundary perturbation. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and Imagenette datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing not only improved robustness against evasion adversaries but also superior resistance to watermark removal attacks compared to state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Present-day graphical user interfaces (GUIs) exhibit diverse arrangements of text, graphics, and interactive elements such as buttons and menus, but representations of GUIs have not kept up. They do not encapsulate both semantic and visuo-spatial relationships among elements. To seize machine learning's potential for GUIs more efficiently, Graph4GUI exploits graph neural networks to capture individual elements' properties and their semantic-visuo-spatial constraints in a layout. The learned representation demonstrated its effectiveness in multiple tasks, especially generating designs in a challenging GUI autocompletion task, which involved predicting the positions of remaining unplaced elements in a partially completed GUI. The new model's suggestions showed alignment and visual appeal superior to the baseline method and received higher subjective ratings for preference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical benefits and efficiency advantages designers perceive when utilizing our model as an autocompletion plug-in.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work is motivated by recent developments in Deep Neural Networks, particularly the Transformer architectures underlying applications such as ChatGPT, and the need for performing inference on mobile devices. Focusing on emerging transformers (specifically the ones with computationally efficient Swin-like architectures) and large models (e.g., Stable Diffusion and LLMs) based on transformers, we observe that layout transformations between the computational operators cause a significant slowdown in these applications. This paper presents SmartMem, a comprehensive framework for eliminating most layout transformations, with the idea that multiple operators can use the same tensor layout through careful choice of layout and implementation of operations. Our approach is based on classifying the operators into four groups, and considering combinations of producer-consumer edges between the operators. We develop a set of methods for searching such layouts. Another component of our work is developing efficient memory layouts for 2.5 dimensional memory commonly seen in mobile devices. Our experimental results show that SmartMem outperforms 5 state-of-the-art DNN execution frameworks on mobile devices across 18 varied neural networks, including CNNs, Transformers with both local and global attention, as well as LLMs. In particular, compared to DNNFusion, SmartMem achieves an average speedup of 2.8$\times$, and outperforms TVM and MNN with speedups of 6.9$\times$ and 7.9$\times$, respectively, on average.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces an innovative approach to classifying various types of Persian rice using image-based deep learning techniques, highlighting the practical application of everyday technology in food categorization. Recognizing the diversity of Persian rice and its culinary significance, we leveraged the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically by fine-tuning a ResNet model for accurate identification of different rice varieties and employing a U-Net architecture for precise segmentation of rice grains in bulk images. This dual-methodology framework allows for both individual grain classification and comprehensive analysis of bulk rice samples, addressing two crucial aspects of rice quality assessment. Utilizing images captured with consumer-grade cell phones reflects a realistic scenario in which individuals can leverage this technology for assistance with grocery shopping and meal preparation. The dataset, comprising various rice types photographed under natural conditions without professional lighting or equipment, presents a challenging yet practical classification problem. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using non-professional images for food classification and the potential of deep learning models, like ResNet and U-Net, to adapt to the nuances of everyday objects and textures. This study contributes to the field by providing insights into the applicability of image-based deep learning in daily life, specifically for enhancing consumer experiences and knowledge in food selection. Furthermore, it opens avenues for extending this approach to other food categories and practical applications, emphasizing the role of accessible technology in bridging the gap between sophisticated computational methods and everyday tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Wu, Hao Xu, Maohua Gu, Zhongchuan Jiang, Jun Xu, Youliang Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Dental fluorosis is a chronic disease caused by long-term overconsumption of fluoride, which leads to changes in the appearance of tooth enamel. It is an important basis for early non-invasive diagnosis of endemic fluorosis. However, even dental professionals may not be able to accurately distinguish dental fluorosis and its severity based on tooth images. Currently, there is still a gap in research on applying deep learning to diagnosing dental fluorosis. Therefore, we construct the first open-source dental fluorosis image dataset (DFID), laying the foundation for deep learning research in this field. To advance the diagnosis of dental fluorosis, we propose a pioneering deep learning model called masked latent transformer with the random masking ratio (MLTrMR). MLTrMR introduces a mask latent modeling scheme based on Vision Transformer to enhance contextual learning of dental fluorosis lesion characteristics. Consisting of a latent embedder, encoder, and decoder, MLTrMR employs the latent embedder to extract latent tokens from the original image, whereas the encoder and decoder comprising the latent transformer (LT) block are used to process unmasked tokens and predict masked tokens, respectively. To mitigate the lack of inductive bias in Vision Transformer, which may result in performance degradation, the LT block introduces latent tokens to enhance the learning capacity of latent lesion features. Furthermore, we design an auxiliary loss function to constrain the parameter update direction of the model. MLTrMR achieves 80.19% accuracy, 75.79% F1, and 81.28% quadratic weighted kappa on DFID, making it state-of-the-art (SOTA).</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have demonstrated great success in various fields of multimedia. However, the distribution shift between the training and test data challenges the effectiveness of GNNs. To mitigate this challenge, Test-Time Training (TTT) has been proposed as a promising approach. Traditional TTT methods require a demanding unsupervised training strategy to capture the information from test to benefit the main task. Inspired by the great annotation ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), we propose to enhance the test-time training on graphs with LLMs as annotators. In this paper, we design a novel Test-Time Training pipeline, LLMTTT, which conducts the test-time adaptation under the annotations by LLMs on a carefully-selected node set. Specifically, LLMTTT introduces a hybrid active node selection strategy that considers not only node diversity and representativeness, but also prediction signals from the pre-trained model. Given annotations from LLMs, a two-stage training strategy is designed to tailor the test-time model with the limited and noisy labels. A theoretical analysis ensures the validity of our method and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LLMTTT can achieve a significant performance improvement compared to existing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In federated learning, particularly in cross-device scenarios, secure aggregation has recently gained popularity as it effectively defends against inference attacks by malicious aggregators. However, secure aggregation often requires additional communication overhead and can impede the convergence rate of the global model, which is particularly challenging in wireless network environments with extremely limited bandwidth. Therefore, achieving efficient communication compression under the premise of secure aggregation presents a highly challenging and valuable problem. In this work, we propose a novel uplink communication compression method for federated learning, named FedMPQ, which is based on multi shared codebook product quantization.Specifically, we utilize updates from the previous round to generate sufficiently robust codebooks. Secure aggregation is then achieved through trusted execution environments (TEE) or a trusted third party (TTP).In contrast to previous works, our approach exhibits greater robustness in scenarios where data is not independently and identically distributed (non-IID) and there is a lack of sufficient public data. The experiments conducted on the LEAF dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves 99% of the baseline's final accuracy, while reducing uplink communications by 90-95%</p>

<p>Abstract: Controllable text-to-image generation synthesizes visual text and objects in images with certain conditions, which are frequently applied to emoji and poster generation. Visual text rendering and layout-to-image generation tasks have been popular in controllable text-to-image generation. However, each of these tasks typically focuses on single modality generation or rendering, leaving yet-to-be-bridged gaps between the approaches correspondingly designed for each of the tasks. In this paper, we combine text rendering and layout-to-image generation tasks into a single task: layout-controllable text-object synthesis (LTOS) task, aiming at synthesizing images with object and visual text based on predefined object layout and text contents. As compliant datasets are not readily available for our LTOS task, we construct a layout-aware text-object synthesis dataset, containing elaborate well-aligned labels of visual text and object information. Based on the dataset, we propose a layout-controllable text-object adaptive fusion (TOF) framework, which generates images with clear, legible visual text and plausible objects. We construct a visual-text rendering module to synthesize text and employ an object-layout control module to generate objects while integrating the two modules to harmoniously generate and integrate text content and objects in images. To better the image-text integration, we propose a self-adaptive cross-attention fusion module that helps the image generation to attend more to important text information. Within such a fusion module, we use a self-adaptive learnable factor to learn to flexibly control the influence of cross-attention outputs on image generation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in LTOS, text rendering, and layout-to-image tasks, enabling harmonious visual text rendering and object generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiqiang Chen, Tianqing Zhu, Xin Yu, Wanlei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to enable models to forget specific data instances when receiving deletion requests. Current research centres on efficient unlearning to erase the influence of data from the model and neglects the subsequent impacts on the remaining data. Consequently, existing unlearning algorithms degrade the model's performance after unlearning, known as \textit{over-unlearning}. This paper addresses this critical yet under-explored issue by introducing machine \underline{U}nlearning via \underline{N}ull \underline{S}pace \underline{C}alibration (UNSC), which can accurately unlearn target samples without over-unlearning. On the contrary, by calibrating the decision space during unlearning, UNSC can significantly improve the model's performance on the remaining samples. In particular, our approach hinges on confining the unlearning process to a specified null space tailored to the remaining samples, which is augmented by strategically pseudo-labeling the unlearning samples. Comparative analyses against several established baselines affirm the superiority of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Pantazopoulos, Alessandro Suglia, Oliver Lemon, Arash Eshghi</p>
<p>Abstract: An effective method for combining frozen large language models (LLM) and visual encoders involves a resampler module that creates a `visual prompt' which is provided to the LLM, along with the textual prompt. While this approach has enabled impressive performance across many coarse-grained tasks like image captioning and visual question answering, more fine-grained tasks that require spatial understanding have not been thoroughly examined. In this paper, we use \textit{diagnostic classifiers} to measure the extent to which the visual prompt produced by the resampler encodes spatial information. Our results show that this information is largely absent from the resampler output when kept frozen during training of the classifiers. However, when the resampler and classifier are trained jointly, we observe a significant performance boost. This shows that the compression achieved by the resamplers can in principle encode the requisite spatial information, but that more object-aware objectives are needed at the pretraining stage to facilitate this capability</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liheng Ma, Soumyasundar Pal, Yitian Zhang, Jiaming Zhou, Yingxue Zhang, Mark Coates</p>
<p>Abstract: The existing definitions of graph convolution, either from spatial or spectral perspectives, are inflexible and not unified. Defining a general convolution operator in the graph domain is challenging due to the lack of canonical coordinates, the presence of irregular structures, and the properties of graph symmetries. In this work, we propose a novel graph convolution framework by parameterizing the kernels as continuous functions of pseudo-coordinates derived via graph positional encoding. We name this Continuous Kernel Graph Convolution (CKGConv). Theoretically, we demonstrate that CKGConv is flexible and expressive. CKGConv encompasses many existing graph convolutions, and exhibits the same expressiveness as graph transformers in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. Empirically, we show that CKGConv-based Networks outperform existing graph convolutional networks and perform comparably to the best graph transformers across a variety of graph datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked substantial interest and debate concerning their potential emergence of Theory of Mind (ToM) ability. Theory of mind evaluations currently focuses on testing models using machine-generated data or game settings prone to shortcuts and spurious correlations, which lacks evaluation of machine ToM ability in real-world human interaction scenarios. This poses a pressing demand to develop new real-world scenario benchmarks. We introduce NegotiationToM, a new benchmark designed to stress-test machine ToM in real-world negotiation surrounding covered multi-dimensional mental states (i.e., desires, beliefs, and intentions). Our benchmark builds upon the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent modeling theory and conducts the necessary empirical experiments to evaluate large language models. Our findings demonstrate that NegotiationToM is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, as they consistently perform significantly worse than humans, even when employing the chain-of-thought (CoT) method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Resmi Ramachandranpillai, Md Fahim Sikder, David Bergstr\"om, Fredrik Heintz</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to enhance the usefulness of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) by generating realistic de-identified data. However, the existing literature primarily focuses on the quality of synthetic health data, neglecting the crucial aspect of fairness in downstream predictions. Consequently, models trained on synthetic EHR have faced criticism for producing biased outcomes in target tasks. These biases can arise from either spurious correlations between features or the failure of models to accurately represent sub-groups. To address these concerns, we present Bias-transforming Generative Adversarial Networks (Bt-GAN), a GAN-based synthetic data generator specifically designed for the healthcare domain. In order to tackle spurious correlations (i), we propose an information-constrained Data Generation Process that enables the generator to learn a fair deterministic transformation based on a well-defined notion of algorithmic fairness. To overcome the challenge of capturing exact sub-group representations (ii), we incentivize the generator to preserve sub-group densities through score-based weighted sampling. This approach compels the generator to learn from underrepresented regions of the data manifold. We conduct extensive experiments using the MIMIC-III database. Our results demonstrate that Bt-GAN achieves SOTA accuracy while significantly improving fairness and minimizing bias amplification. We also perform an in-depth explainability analysis to provide additional evidence supporting the validity of our study. In conclusion, our research introduces a novel and professional approach to addressing the limitations of synthetic data generation in the healthcare domain. By incorporating fairness considerations and leveraging advanced techniques such as GANs, we pave the way for more reliable and unbiased predictions in healthcare applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, deep learning helped solve manipulation problems across all domains of robotics. At the same time, industrial robots continue to be programmed overwhelmingly using traditional program representations and interfaces. This paper undertakes an analysis of this "AI adoption gap" from an industry practitioner's perspective. In response, we propose the BANSAI approach (Bridging the AI Adoption Gap via Neurosymbolic AI). It systematically leverages principles of neurosymbolic AI to establish data-driven, subsymbolic program synthesis and optimization in modern industrial robot programming workflow. BANSAI conceptually unites several lines of prior research and proposes a path toward practical, real-world validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehao Dong, Muhan Zhang, Yixin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of machine learning on non-Euclidean data such as graphs and networks. GNNs effectively implement node representation learning through neighborhood aggregation and achieve impressive results in many graph-related tasks. However, most neighborhood aggregation approaches are summation-based, which can be problematic as they may not be sufficiently expressive to encode informative graph structures. Furthermore, though the graph pooling module is also of vital importance for graph learning, especially for the task of graph classification, research on graph down-sampling mechanisms is rather limited.
  To address the above challenges, we propose a concatenation-based graph convolution mechanism that injectively updates node representations to maximize the discriminative power in distinguishing non-isomorphic subgraphs. In addition, we design a novel graph pooling module, called WL-SortPool, to learn important subgraph patterns in a deep-learning manner. WL-SortPool layer-wise sorts node representations (i.e. continuous WL colors) to separately learn the relative importance of subtrees with different depths for the purpose of classification, thus better characterizing the complex graph topology and rich information encoded in the graph. We propose a novel Subgraph Pattern GNN (SPGNN) architecture that incorporates these enhancements. We test the proposed SPGNN architecture on many graph classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method can achieve highly competitive results with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other GNN approaches.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13657">MLP: Motion Label Prior for Temporal Sentence Localization in Untrimmed 3D Human Motions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Yan, Mengyuan Liu, Yong Wang, Yang Liu, Chen Chen, Hong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the unexplored question of temporal sentence localization in human motions (TSLM), aiming to locate a target moment from a 3D human motion that semantically corresponds to a text query. Considering that 3D human motions are captured using specialized motion capture devices, motions with only a few joints lack complex scene information like objects and lighting. Due to this character, motion data has low contextual richness and semantic ambiguity between frames, which limits the accuracy of predictions made by current video localization frameworks extended to TSLM to only a rough level. To refine this, we devise two novel label-prior-assisted training schemes: one embed prior knowledge of foreground and background to highlight the localization chances of target moments, and the other forces the originally rough predictions to overlap with the more accurate predictions obtained from the flipped start/end prior label sequences during recovery training. We show that injecting label-prior knowledge into the model is crucial for improving performance at high IoU. In our constructed TSLM benchmark, our model termed MLP achieves a recall of 44.13 at IoU@0.7 on the BABEL dataset and 71.17 on HumanML3D (Restore), outperforming prior works. Finally, we showcase the potential of our approach in corpus-level moment retrieval. Our source code is openly accessible at https://github.com/eanson023/mlp.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingqing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing temporal point process models are characterized by conditional intensity function. These models often require numerical approximation methods for likelihood evaluation, which potentially hurts their performance. By directly modelling the integral of the intensity function, i.e., the cumulative hazard function (CHF), the likelihood can be evaluated accurately, making it a promising approach. However, existing CHF-based methods are not well-defined, i.e., the mathematical constraints of CHF are not completely satisfied, leading to untrustworthy results. For multivariate temporal point process, most existing methods model intensity (or density, etc.) functions for each variate, limiting the scalability. In this paper, we explore using neural networks to model a flexible but well-defined CHF and learning the multivariate temporal point process with low parameter complexity. Experimental results on six datasets show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on data fitting and event prediction tasks while having significantly fewer parameters and memory usage than the strong competitors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix M. Schmitt-Koopmann, Elaine M. Huang, Hans-Peter Hutter, Thilo Stadelmann, Alireza Darvishy</p>
<p>Abstract: Printed mathematical expression recognition (MER) models are usually trained and tested using LaTeX-generated mathematical expressions (MEs) as input and the LaTeX source code as ground truth. As the same ME can be generated by various different LaTeX source codes, this leads to unwanted variations in the ground truth data that bias test performance results and hinder efficient learning. In addition, the use of only one font to generate the MEs heavily limits the generalization of the reported results to realistic scenarios. We propose a data-centric approach to overcome this problem, and present convincing experimental results: Our main contribution is an enhanced LaTeX normalization to map any LaTeX ME to a canonical form. Based on this process, we developed an improved version of the benchmark dataset im2latex-100k, featuring 30 fonts instead of one. Second, we introduce the real-world dataset realFormula, with MEs extracted from papers. Third, we developed a MER model, MathNet, based on a convolutional vision transformer, with superior results on all four test sets (im2latex-100k, im2latexv2, realFormula, and InftyMDB-1), outperforming the previous state of the art by up to 88.3%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image-to-video(I2V) generation aims to create a video sequence from a single image, which requires high temporal coherence and visual fidelity with the source image.However, existing approaches suffer from character appearance inconsistency and poor preservation of fine details. Moreover, they require a large amount of video data for training, which can be computationally demanding.To address these limitations,we propose PoseAnimate, a novel zero-shot I2V framework for character animation.PoseAnimate contains three key components: 1) Pose-Aware Control Module (PACM) incorporates diverse pose signals into conditional embeddings, to preserve character-independent content and maintain precise alignment of actions.2) Dual Consistency Attention Module (DCAM) enhances temporal consistency, and retains character identity and intricate background details.3) Mask-Guided Decoupling Module (MGDM) refines distinct feature perception, improving animation fidelity by decoupling the character and background.We also propose a Pose Alignment Transition Algorithm (PATA) to ensure smooth action transition.Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art training-based methods in terms of character consistency and detail fidelity. Moreover, it maintains a high level of temporal coherence throughout the generated animations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivated by ethical and legal concerns, the scientific community is actively developing methods to limit the misuse of Text-to-Image diffusion models for reproducing copyrighted, violent, explicit, or personal information in the generated images. Simultaneously, researchers put these newly developed safety measures to the test by assuming the role of an adversary to find vulnerabilities and backdoors in them. We use compositional property of diffusion models, which allows to leverage multiple prompts in a single image generation. This property allows us to combine other concepts, that should not have been affected by the inhibition, to reconstruct the vector, responsible for target concept generation, even though the direct computation of this vector is no longer accessible. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence why the proposed attacks are possible and discuss the implications of these findings for safe model deployment. We argue that it is essential to consider all possible approaches to image generation with diffusion models that can be employed by an adversary. Our work opens up the discussion about the implications of concept arithmetics and compositional inference for safety mechanisms in diffusion models.

<p>Abstract: Autonomous and intelligent systems (AIS) facilitate a wide range of beneficial applications across a variety of different domains. However, technical characteristics such as unpredictability and lack of transparency, as well as potential unintended consequences, pose considerable challenges to the current governance infrastructure. Furthermore, the speed of development and deployment of applications outpaces the ability of existing governance institutions to put in place effective ethical-legal oversight. New approaches for agile, distributed and multilevel governance are needed. This work presents a practical framework for multilevel governance of AIS. The framework enables mapping actors onto six levels of decision-making including the international, national and organizational levels. Furthermore, it offers the ability to identify and evolve existing tools or create new tools for guiding the behavior of actors within the levels. Governance mechanisms enable actors to shape and enforce regulations and other tools, which when complemented with good practices contribute to effective and comprehensive governance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dataset condensation, a concept within data-centric learning, efficiently transfers critical attributes from an original dataset to a synthetic version, maintaining both diversity and realism. This approach significantly improves model training efficiency and is adaptable across multiple application areas. Previous methods in dataset condensation have faced challenges: some incur high computational costs which limit scalability to larger datasets (e.g., MTT, DREAM, and TESLA), while others are restricted to less optimal design spaces, which could hinder potential improvements, especially in smaller datasets (e.g., SRe2L, G-VBSM, and RDED). To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive design framework that includes specific, effective strategies like implementing soft category-aware matching and adjusting the learning rate schedule. These strategies are grounded in empirical evidence and theoretical backing. Our resulting approach, Elucidate Dataset Condensation (EDC), establishes a benchmark for both small and large-scale dataset condensation. In our testing, EDC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reaching 48.6% on ImageNet-1k with a ResNet-18 model at an IPC of 10, which corresponds to a compression ratio of 0.78%. This performance exceeds those of SRe2L, G-VBSM, and RDED by margins of 27.3%, 17.2%, and 6.6%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junqi Jiang, Francesco Leofante, Antonio Rago, Francesca Toni</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) have emerged as a major paradigm in explainable AI research, providing recourse recommendations for users affected by the decisions of machine learning models. However, when slight changes occur in the parameters of the underlying model, CEs found by existing methods often become invalid for the updated models. The literature lacks a way to certify deterministic robustness guarantees for CEs under model changes, in that existing methods to improve CEs' robustness are heuristic, and the robustness performances are evaluated empirically using only a limited number of retrained models. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel interval abstraction technique for parametric machine learning models, which allows us to obtain provable robustness guarantees of CEs under the possibly infinite set of plausible model changes $\Delta$. We formalise our robustness notion as the $\Delta$-robustness for CEs, in both binary and multi-class classification settings. We formulate procedures to verify $\Delta$-robustness based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming, using which we further propose two algorithms to generate CEs that are $\Delta$-robust. In an extensive empirical study, we demonstrate how our approach can be used in practice by discussing two strategies for determining the appropriate hyperparameter in our method, and we quantitatively benchmark the CEs generated by eleven methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our algorithms in finding robust CEs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work we study the problem of Stochastic Budgeted Multi-round Submodular Maximization (SBMSm), in which we would like to maximize the sum over multiple rounds of the value of a monotone and submodular objective function, subject to the fact that the values of this function depend on the realization of stochastic events and the number of observations that we can make over all rounds is limited by a given budget. This problem extends, and generalizes to multiple round settings, well-studied problems such as (adaptive) influence maximization and stochastic probing.
  We first show that whenever a certain single-round optimization problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time, then there is a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm that returns the same solution as the optimal algorithm, that can adaptively choose both which observations to make and in which round to have them. Unfortunately, this dynamic programming approach cannot be extended to work when the single-round optimization problem cannot be efficiently solved (even if we allow it would be approximated within an arbitrary small constant). Anyway, in this case we are able to provide a simple greedy algorithm for the problem. It guarantees a $(1/2-\epsilon)$-approximation to the optimal value, even if it non-adaptively allocates the budget to rounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadav Cohen, Itzik Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) commonly utilize an inertial navigation system (INS) and a Doppler velocity log (DVL) for underwater navigation. To that end, their measurements are integrated through a nonlinear filter such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The DVL velocity vector estimate depends on retrieving reflections from the seabed, ensuring that at least three out of its four transmitted acoustic beams return successfully. When fewer than three beams are obtained, the DVL cannot provide a velocity update to bind the navigation solution drift. To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose a hybrid neural coupled (HNC) approach for seamless AUV navigation in situations of limited DVL measurements. First, we drive an approach to regress two or three missing DVL beams. Then, those beams, together with the measured beams, are incorporated into the EKF. We examined INS/DVL fusion both in loosely and tightly coupled approaches. Our method was trained and evaluated on recorded data from AUV experiments conducted in the Mediterranean Sea on two different occasions. The results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline loosely and tightly coupled model-based approaches by an average of 96.15%. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to a model-based beam estimator by an average of 12.41% in terms of velocity accuracy for scenarios involving two or three missing beams. Therefore, we demonstrate that our approach offers seamless AUV navigation in situations of limited beam measurements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Nasal Cytology is a new and efficient clinical technique to diagnose rhinitis and allergies that is not much widespread due to the time-consuming nature of cell counting; that is why AI-aided counting could be a turning point for the diffusion of this technique. In this article we present the first dataset of rhino-cytological field images: the NCD (Nasal Cytology Dataset), aimed to train and deploy Object Detection models to support physicians and biologists during clinical practice. The real distribution of the cytotypes, populating the nasal mucosa has been replicated, sampling images from slides of clinical patients, and manually annotating each cell found on them. The correspondent object detection task presents non'trivial issues associated with the strong class imbalancement, involving the rarest cell types. This work contributes to some of open challenges by presenting a novel machine learning-based approach to aid the automated detection and classification of nasal mucosa cells: the DETR and YOLO models shown good performance in detecting cells and classifying them correctly, revealing great potential to accelerate the work of rhinology experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Zhang, Zeming Wei, Jun Sun, Meng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has introduced Representation Engineering (RepE) as a promising approach for understanding complex inner workings of large-scale models like Large Language Models (LLMs). However, finding practical and efficient methods to apply these representations for general and flexible model editing remains an open problem. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, we introduce a novel approach called Adversarial Representation Engineering (ARE). This method leverages RepE by using a representation sensor to guide the editing of LLMs, offering a unified and interpretable framework for conceptual model editing without degrading baseline performance. Our experiments on multiple conceptual editing confirm ARE's effectiveness. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Zhang-Yihao/Adversarial-Representation-Engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Potter, Rahil Bhowal, Richard Zhao, Anuj Patel, Jingming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In response to the critical need for effective reconnaissance in disaster scenarios, this research article presents the design and implementation of a complete autonomous robot system using the Turtlebot3 with Robotic Operating System (ROS) Noetic. Upon deployment in closed, initially unknown environments, the system aims to generate a comprehensive map and identify any present 'victims' using AprilTags as stand-ins. We discuss our solution for search and rescue missions, while additionally exploring more advanced algorithms to improve search and rescue functionalities. We introduce a Cubature Kalman Filter to help reduce the mean squared error [m] for AprilTag localization and an information-theoretic exploration algorithm to expedite exploration in unknown environments. Just like turtles, our system takes it slow and steady, but when it's time to save the day, it moves at ninja-like speed! Despite Donatello's shell, he's no slowpoke - he zips through obstacles with the agility of a teenage mutant ninja turtle. So, hang on tight to your shells and get ready for a whirlwind of reconnaissance!

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasanul Mahmud, Kevin Desai, Palden Lama, Sushil K. Prasad</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, and the quest to enhance DNN accuracy without inflating model size or latency remains a pressing concern. We make a couple of advances in this regard, leading to a novel EncodeNet design and training framework. The first advancement involves Converting Autoencoders, a novel approach that transforms images into an easy-to-classify image of its class. Our prior work that applied the Converting Autoencoder and a simple classifier in tandem achieved moderate accuracy over simple datasets, such as MNIST and FMNIST. However, on more complex datasets like CIFAR-10, the Converting Autoencoder has a large reconstruction loss, making it unsuitable for enhancing DNN accuracy. To address these limitations, we generalize the design of Converting Autoencoders by leveraging a larger class of DNNs, those with architectures comprising feature extraction layers followed by classification layers. We incorporate a generalized algorithmic design of the Converting Autoencoder and intraclass clustering to identify representative images, leading to optimized image feature learning. Next, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our EncodeNet design and training framework, improving the accuracy of well-trained baseline DNNs while maintaining the overall model size. EncodeNet's building blocks comprise the trained encoder from our generalized Converting Autoencoders transferring knowledge to a lightweight classifier network - also extracted from the baseline DNN. Our experimental results demonstrate that EncodeNet improves the accuracy of VGG16 from 92.64% to 94.05% on CIFAR-10 and RestNet20 from 74.56% to 76.04% on CIFAR-100. It outperforms state-of-the-art techniques that rely on knowledge distillation and attention mechanisms, delivering higher accuracy for models of comparable size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Wang, Yifan Sun, Zhentao Tan, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores in-context learning for image copy detection (ICD), i.e., prompting an ICD model to identify replicated images with new tampering patterns without the need for additional training. The prompts (or the contexts) are from a small set of image-replica pairs that reflect the new patterns and are used at inference time. Such in-context ICD has good realistic value, because it requires no fine-tuning and thus facilitates fast reaction against the emergence of unseen patterns. To accommodate the "seen $\rightarrow$ unseen" generalization scenario, we construct the first large-scale pattern dataset named AnyPattern, which has the largest number of tamper patterns ($90$ for training and $10$ for testing) among all the existing ones. We benchmark AnyPattern with popular ICD methods and reveal that existing methods barely generalize to novel tamper patterns. We further propose a simple in-context ICD method named ImageStacker. ImageStacker learns to select the most representative image-replica pairs and employs them as the pattern prompts in a stacking manner (rather than the popular concatenation manner). Experimental results show (1) training with our large-scale dataset substantially benefits pattern generalization ($+26.66 \%$ $\mu AP$), (2) the proposed ImageStacker facilitates effective in-context ICD (another round of $+16.75 \%$ $\mu AP$), and (3) AnyPattern enables in-context ICD, i.e. without such a large-scale dataset, in-context learning does not emerge even with our ImageStacker. The project (including the proposed dataset AnyPattern and the code for ImageStacker) is publicly available at https://anypattern.github.io under the MIT Licence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghuo Zeng, Yanan Wang, Kazushi Ikeda, Yi Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Metric learning minimizes the gap between similar (positive) pairs of data points and increases the separation of dissimilar (negative) pairs, aiming at capturing the underlying data structure and enhancing the performance of tasks like audio-visual cross-modal retrieval (AV-CMR). Recent works employ sampling methods to select impactful data points from the embedding space during training. However, the model training fails to fully explore the space due to the scarcity of training data points, resulting in an incomplete representation of the overall positive and negative distributions. In this paper, we propose an innovative Anchor-aware Deep Metric Learning (AADML) method to address this challenge by uncovering the underlying correlations among existing data points, which enhances the quality of the shared embedding space. Specifically, our method establishes a correlation graph-based manifold structure by considering the dependencies between each sample as the anchor and its semantically similar samples. Through dynamic weighting of the correlations within this underlying manifold structure using an attention-driven mechanism, Anchor Awareness (AA) scores are obtained for each anchor. These AA scores serve as data proxies to compute relative distances in metric learning approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on two audio-visual benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AADML method, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of AA proxies with various metric learning methods, further highlighting the efficacy of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven A. Grosz, Anil K. Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: The utilization of synthetic data for fingerprint recognition has garnered increased attention due to its potential to alleviate privacy concerns surrounding sensitive biometric data. However, current methods for generating fingerprints have limitations in creating impressions of the same finger with useful intra-class variations. To tackle this challenge, we present GenPrint, a framework to produce fingerprint images of various types while maintaining identity and offering humanly understandable control over different appearance factors such as fingerprint class, acquisition type, sensor device, and quality level. Unlike previous fingerprint generation approaches, GenPrint is not confined to replicating style characteristics from the training dataset alone: it enables the generation of novel styles from unseen devices without requiring additional fine-tuning. To accomplish these objectives, we developed GenPrint using latent diffusion models with multimodal conditions (text and image) for consistent generation of style and identity. Our experiments leverage a variety of publicly available datasets for training and evaluation. Results demonstrate the benefits of GenPrint in terms of identity preservation, explainable control, and universality of generated images. Importantly, the GenPrint-generated images yield comparable or even superior accuracy to models trained solely on real data and further enhances performance when augmenting the diversity of existing real fingerprint datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghuo Zeng, Roberto S. Legaspi, Yuewen Sun, Xinshuai Dong, Kazushi Ikeda, Peter Spirtes, kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Customizing persuasive conversations related to the outcome of interest for specific users achieves better persuasion results. However, existing persuasive conversation systems rely on persuasive strategies and encounter challenges in dynamically adjusting dialogues to suit the evolving states of individual users during interactions. This limitation restricts the system's ability to deliver flexible or dynamic conversations and achieve suboptimal persuasion outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel approach that tracks a user's latent personality dimensions (LPDs) during ongoing persuasion conversation and generates tailored counterfactual utterances based on these LPDs to optimize the overall persuasion outcome. In particular, our proposed method leverages a Bi-directional Generative Adversarial Network (BiCoGAN) in tandem with a Dialogue-based Personality Prediction Regression (DPPR) model to generate counterfactual data. This enables the system to formulate alternative persuasive utterances that are more suited to the user. Subsequently, we utilize the D3QN model to learn policies for optimized selection of system utterances on counterfactual data. Experimental results we obtained from using the PersuasionForGood dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the existing method, BiCoGAN. The cumulative rewards and Q-values produced by our method surpass ground truth benchmarks, showcasing the efficacy of employing counterfactual reasoning and LPDs to optimize reinforcement learning policy in online interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of social network advertising, the volume and accuracy of data play a critical role in the performance of predictive models. However, the development of robust predictive algorithms is often hampered by the limited size and potential bias present in real-world datasets. This study presents and explores a generative augmentation framework of social network advertising data. Our framework explores three generative models for data augmentation - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) - to enrich data availability and diversity in the context of social network advertising analytics effectiveness. By performing synthetic extensions of the feature space, we find that through data augmentation, the performance of various classifiers has been quantitatively improved. Furthermore, we compare the relative performance gains brought by each data augmentation technique, providing insights for practitioners to select appropriate techniques to enhance model performance. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that synthetic data augmentation alleviates the limitations imposed by small or imbalanced datasets in the field of social network advertising. At the same time, this article also provides a comparative perspective on the practicality of different data augmentation methods, thereby guiding practitioners to choose appropriate techniques to enhance model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We show that Claude 3 Opus, a large language model (LLM) released by Anthropic in March 2024, exhibits stronger machine translation competence than other LLMs. Though we find evidence of data contamination with Claude on FLORES-200, we curate new benchmarks that corroborate the effectiveness of Claude for low-resource machine translation into English. We find that Claude has remarkable \textit{resource efficiency} -- the degree to which the quality of the translation model depends on a language pair's resource level. Finally, we show that advancements in LLM translation can be compressed into traditional neural machine translation (NMT) models. Using Claude to generate synthetic data, we demonstrate that knowledge distillation advances the state-of-the-art in Yoruba-English translation, meeting or surpassing strong baselines like NLLB-54B and Google Translate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marie Siew, Haoran Zhang, Jong-Ik Park, Yuezhou Liu, Yichen Ruan, Lili Su, Stratis Ioannidis, Edmund Yeh, Carlee Joe-Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning across multiple clients. In most FL work, all clients train a single learning task. However, the recent proliferation of FL applications may increasingly require multiple FL tasks to be trained simultaneously, sharing clients' computing and communication resources, which we call Multiple-Model Federated Learning (MMFL). Current MMFL algorithms use naive average-based client-task allocation schemes that can lead to unfair performance when FL tasks have heterogeneous difficulty levels, e.g., tasks with larger models may need more rounds and data to train. Just as naively allocating resources to generic computing jobs with heterogeneous resource needs can lead to unfair outcomes, naive allocation of clients to FL tasks can lead to unfairness, with some tasks having excessively long training times, or lower converged accuracies. Furthermore, in the FL setting, since clients are typically not paid for their training effort, we face a further challenge that some clients may not even be willing to train some tasks, e.g., due to high computational costs, which may exacerbate unfairness in training outcomes across tasks. We address both challenges by firstly designing FedFairMMFL, a difficulty-aware algorithm that dynamically allocates clients to tasks in each training round. We provide guarantees on airness and FedFairMMFL's convergence rate. We then propose a novel auction design that incentivizes clients to train multiple tasks, so as to fairly distribute clients' training efforts across the tasks. We show how our fairness-based learning and incentive mechanisms impact training convergence and finally evaluate our algorithm with multiple sets of learning tasks on real world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: A primary function of back-propagation is to compute both the gradient of hidden representations and parameters for optimization with gradient descent. Training large models requires high computational costs due to their vast parameter sizes. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods aim to train smaller auxiliary models to save computational space, they still present computational overheads, especially in Fine-Tuning as a Service (FTaaS) for numerous users. We introduce Collaborative Adaptation (ColA) with Gradient Learning (GL), a parameter-free, model-agnostic fine-tuning approach that decouples the computation of the gradient of hidden representations and parameters. In comparison to PEFT methods, ColA facilitates more cost-effective FTaaS by offloading the computation of the gradient to low-cost devices. We also provide a theoretical analysis of ColA and experimentally demonstrate that ColA can perform on par or better than existing PEFT methods on various benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tetsuro Morimura, Mitsuki Sakamoto, Yuu Jinnai, Kenshi Abe, Kaito Air</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning language models with human preferences. While the significance of dataset quality is generally recognized, explicit investigations into its impact within the RLHF framework, to our knowledge, have been limited. This paper addresses the issue of text quality within the preference dataset by focusing on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), an increasingly adopted reward-model-free RLHF method. We confirm that text quality significantly influences the performance of models optimized with DPO more than those optimized with reward-model-based RLHF. Building on this new insight, we propose an extension of DPO, termed filtered direct preference optimization (fDPO). fDPO uses a trained reward model to monitor the quality of texts within the preference dataset during DPO training. Samples of lower quality are discarded based on comparisons with texts generated by the model being optimized, resulting in a more accurate dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO enhances the final model performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/filtered-dpo.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building fair deep neural networks (DNNs) is a crucial step towards achieving trustworthy artificial intelligence. Delving into deeper factors that affect the fairness of DNNs is paramount and serves as the foundation for mitigating model biases. However, current methods are limited in accurately predicting DNN biases, relying solely on the number of training samples and lacking more precise measurement tools. Here, we establish a geometric perspective for analyzing the fairness of DNNs, comprehensively exploring how DNNs internally shape the intrinsic geometric characteristics of datasets-the intrinsic dimensions (IDs) of perceptual manifolds, and the impact of IDs on the fairness of DNNs. Based on multiple findings, we propose Intrinsic Dimension Regularization (IDR), which enhances the fairness and performance of models by promoting the learning of concise and ID-balanced class perceptual manifolds. In various image recognition benchmark tests, IDR significantly mitigates model bias while improving its performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potent tools for advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the attitudinal disparities between LLMs and humans towards these goals can pose significant challenges. This study conducts a comprehensive review and analysis of the existing literature on the attitudes of LLMs towards the 17 SDGs, emphasizing the comparison between their attitudes and support for each goal and those of humans. We examine the potential disparities, primarily focusing on aspects such as understanding and emotions, cultural and regional differences, task objective variations, and factors considered in the decision-making process. These disparities arise from the underrepresentation and imbalance in LLM training data, historical biases, quality issues, lack of contextual understanding, and skewed ethical values reflected. The study also investigates the risks and harms that may arise from neglecting the attitudes of LLMs towards the SDGs, including the exacerbation of social inequalities, racial discrimination, environmental destruction, and resource wastage. To address these challenges, we propose strategies and recommendations to guide and regulate the application of LLMs, ensuring their alignment with the principles and goals of the SDGs, and therefore creating a more just, inclusive, and sustainable future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Xu, Kai Li, Bingyun Liu, Haobo Fu, Qiang Fu, Junliang Xing, Jian Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a family of algorithms for effectively solving imperfect-information games. It decomposes the total regret into counterfactual regrets, utilizing local regret minimization algorithms, such as Regret Matching (RM) or RM+, to minimize them. Recent research establishes a connection between Online Mirror Descent (OMD) and RM+, paving the way for an optimistic variant PRM+ and its extension PCFR+. However, PCFR+ assigns uniform weights for each iteration when determining regrets, leading to substantial regrets when facing dominated actions. This work explores minimizing weighted counterfactual regret with optimistic OMD, resulting in a novel CFR variant PDCFR+. It integrates PCFR+ and Discounted CFR (DCFR) in a principled manner, swiftly mitigating negative effects of dominated actions and consistently leveraging predictions to accelerate convergence. Theoretical analyses prove that PDCFR+ converges to a Nash equilibrium, particularly under distinct weighting schemes for regrets and average strategies. Experimental results demonstrate PDCFR+'s fast convergence in common imperfect-information games. The code is available at https://github.com/rpSebastian/PDCFRPlus.</p>

<p>Abstract: With recent advances in speech synthesis including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) systems enabling the generation of ultra-realistic audio deepfakes, there is growing concern about their potential misuse. However, most deepfake (DF) detection methods rely solely on the fuzzy knowledge learned by a single model, resulting in performance bottlenecks and transparency issues. Inspired by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we propose a retrieval-augmented detection (RAD) framework that augments test samples with similar retrieved samples for enhanced detection. We also extend the multi-fusion attentive classifier to integrate it with our proposed RAD framework. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of the proposed RAD framework over baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on the ASVspoof 2021 DF set and competitive results on the 2019 and 2021 LA sets. Further sample analysis indicates that the retriever consistently retrieves samples mostly from the same speaker with acoustic characteristics highly consistent with the query audio, thereby improving detection performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In text-to-image generation tasks, the advancements of diffusion models have facilitated the fidelity of generated results. However, these models encounter challenges when processing text prompts containing multiple entities and attributes. The uneven distribution of attention results in the issues of entity leakage and attribute misalignment. Training from scratch to address this issue requires numerous labeled data and is resource-consuming. Motivated by this, we propose an attribution-focusing mechanism, a training-free phase-wise mechanism by modulation of attention for diffusion model. One of our core ideas is to guide the model to concentrate on the corresponding syntactic components of the prompt at distinct timesteps. To achieve this, we incorporate a temperature control mechanism within the early phases of the self-attention modules to mitigate entity leakage issues. An object-focused masking scheme and a phase-wise dynamic weight control mechanism are integrated into the cross-attention modules, enabling the model to discern the affiliation of semantic information between entities more effectively. The experimental results in various alignment scenarios demonstrate that our model attain better image-text alignment with minimal additional computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: The goal of product copywriting is to capture the interest of potential buyers by emphasizing the features of products through text descriptions. As e-commerce platforms offer a wide range of services, it's becoming essential to dynamically adjust the styles of these auto-generated descriptions. Typical approaches to copywriting generation often rely solely on specified product attributes, which may result in dull and repetitive content. To tackle this issue, we propose to generate copywriting based on customer reviews, as they provide firsthand practical experiences with products, offering a richer source of information than just product attributes. We have developed a sequence-to-sequence framework, enhanced with reinforcement learning, to produce copywriting that is attractive, authentic, and rich in information. Our framework outperforms all existing baseline and zero-shot large language models, including LLaMA-2-chat-7B and GPT-3.5, in terms of both attractiveness and faithfulness. Furthermore, this work features the use of LLMs for aspect-based summaries collection and argument allure assessment. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of using LLMs for marketing domain corpus construction.

In this paper, we present a new method called Integrated Gradient Correlation (IGC) that relates dataset-wise attributions to a model prediction score and enables region-specific analysis by a direct summation over associated components. We demonstrate our method on scalar predictions with the study of image feature representation in the brain from fMRI neural signals and the estimation of neural population receptive fields (NSD dataset), as well as on categorical predictions with the investigation of handwritten digit recognition (MNIST dataset). The resulting IGC attributions show selective patterns, revealing underlying model strategies coherent with their respective objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukyung Lee, Soonwon Ka, Bokyung Son, Pilsung Kang, Jaewook Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the writing process, enabling collaborative content creation and enhancing productivity. However, generating high-quality, user-aligned text remains challenging. In this paper, we propose Writing Path, a framework that uses explicit outlines to guide LLMs in generating goal-oriented, high-quality pieces of writing. Our approach draws inspiration from structured writing planning and reasoning paths, focusing on capturing and reflecting user intentions throughout the writing process. We construct a diverse dataset from unstructured blog posts to benchmark writing performance and introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework assessing the quality of outlines and generated texts. Our evaluations with GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and HyperCLOVA X demonstrate that the Writing Path approach significantly enhances text quality according to both LLMs and human evaluations. This study highlights the potential of integrating writing-specific techniques into LLMs to enhance their ability to meet the diverse writing needs of users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxuan Gao, Min Wang, Maoyin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has shown the great power in the field of fault detection. However, for incipient faults with tiny amplitude, the detection performance of the current deep learning networks (DLNs) is not satisfactory. Even if prior information about the faults is utilized, DLNs can't successfully detect faults 3, 9 and 15 in Tennessee Eastman process (TEP). These faults are notoriously difficult to detect, lacking effective detection technologies in the field of fault detection. In this work, we propose Autoencoder-assisted Feature Ensemble Net (AE-FENet): a deep feature ensemble framework that uses the unsupervised autoencoder to conduct the feature transformation. Compared with the principle component analysis (PCA) technique adopted in the original Feature Ensemble Net (FENet), autoencoder can mine more exact features on incipient faults, which results in the better detection performance of AE-FENet. With same kinds of basic detectors, AE-FENet achieves a state-of-the-art average accuracy over 96% on faults 3, 9 and 15 in TEP, which represents a significant enhancement in performance compared to other methods. Plenty of experiments have been done to extend our framework, proving that DLNs can be utilized efficiently within this architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Ribu Gorton, Andreas Strand, Karsten Brathen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the recent advances in machine learning, creating agents that behave realistically in simulated air combat has become a growing field of interest. This survey explores the application of machine learning techniques for modeling air combat behavior, motivated by the potential to enhance simulation-based pilot training. Current simulated entities tend to lack realistic behavior, and traditional behavior modeling is labor-intensive and prone to loss of essential domain knowledge between development steps. Advancements in reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms have demonstrated that agents may learn complex behavior from data, which could be faster and more scalable than manual methods. Yet, making adaptive agents capable of performing tactical maneuvers and operating weapons and sensors still poses a significant challenge. The survey examines applications, behavior model types, prevalent machine learning methods, and the technical and human challenges in developing adaptive and realistically behaving agents. Another challenge is the transfer of agents from learning environments to military simulation systems and the consequent demand for standardization. Four primary recommendations are presented regarding increased emphasis on beyond-visual-range scenarios, multi-agent machine learning and cooperation, utilization of hierarchical behavior models, and initiatives for standardization and research collaboration. These recommendations aim to address current issues and guide the development of more comprehensive, adaptable, and realistic machine learning-based behavior models for air combat applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichuan Liu, Zefan Wang, Linjie Xu, Jinyu Wang, Lei Song, Tianchun Wang, Chunlin Chen, Wei Cheng, Jiang Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, yet they might be attacked to produce harmful content. Despite efforts to ethically align LLMs, these are often fragile and can be circumvented by jailbreaking attacks through optimized or manual adversarial prompts. To address this, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Protector (IBProtector), a defense mechanism grounded in the information bottleneck principle, and we modify the objective to avoid trivial solutions. The IBProtector selectively compresses and perturbs prompts, facilitated by a lightweight and trainable extractor, preserving only essential information for the target LLMs to respond with the expected answer. Moreover, we further consider a situation where the gradient is not visible to be compatible with any LLM. Our empirical evaluations show that IBProtector outperforms current defense methods in mitigating jailbreak attempts, without overly affecting response quality or inference speed. Its effectiveness and adaptability across various attack methods and target LLMs underscore the potential of IBProtector as a novel, transferable defense that bolsters the security of LLMs without requiring modifications to the underlying models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weili Zeng, Yichao Yan, Qi Zhu, Zhuo Chen, Pengzhi Chu, Weiming Zhao, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) customization aims to create images that embody specific visual concepts delineated in textual descriptions. However, existing works still face a main challenge, concept overfitting. To tackle this challenge, we first analyze overfitting, categorizing it into concept-agnostic overfitting, which undermines non-customized concept knowledge, and concept-specific overfitting, which is confined to customize on limited modalities, i.e, backgrounds, layouts, styles. To evaluate the overfitting degree, we further introduce two metrics, i.e, Latent Fisher divergence and Wasserstein metric to measure the distribution changes of non-customized and customized concept respectively. Drawing from the analysis, we propose Infusion, a T2I customization method that enables the learning of target concepts to avoid being constrained by limited training modalities, while preserving non-customized knowledge. Remarkably, Infusion achieves this feat with remarkable efficiency, requiring a mere 11KB of trained parameters. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both single and multi-concept customized generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinlin Zhu, Xunkai Li, Zhengyu Wu, Di Wu, Miao Hu, Rong-Hua Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Subgraph federated learning (subgraph-FL) is a new distributed paradigm that facilitates the collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client subgraphs. Unfortunately, a significant challenge of subgraph-FL arises from subgraph heterogeneity, which stems from node and topology variation, causing the impaired performance of the global GNN. Despite various studies, they have not yet thoroughly investigated the impact mechanism of subgraph heterogeneity. To this end, we decouple node and topology variation, revealing that they correspond to differences in label distribution and structure homophily. Remarkably, these variations lead to significant differences in the class-wise knowledge reliability of multiple local GNNs, misguiding the model aggregation with varying degrees. Building on this insight, we propose topology-aware data-free knowledge distillation technology (FedTAD), enhancing reliable knowledge transfer from the local model to the global model. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedTAD over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Trajectory modeling refers to characterizing human movement behavior, serving as a pivotal step in understanding mobility patterns. Nevertheless, existing studies typically ignore the confounding effects of geospatial context, leading to the acquisition of spurious correlations and limited generalization capabilities. To bridge this gap, we initially formulate a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to decipher the trajectory representation learning process from a causal perspective. Building upon the SCM, we further present a Trajectory modeling framework (TrajCL) based on Causal Learning, which leverages the backdoor adjustment theory as an intervention tool to eliminate the spurious correlations between geospatial context and trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify that TrajCL markedly enhances performance in trajectory classification tasks while showcasing superior generalization and interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to address the mobile robot localization problem with Triplet Convolutional Neural Networks and test their robustness against changes of the lighting conditions. We have used omnidirectional images from real indoor environments captured in dynamic conditions that have been converted to panoramic format. Two approaches are proposed to address localization by means of triplet neural networks. First, hierarchical localization, which consists in estimating the robot position in two stages: a coarse localization, which involves a room retrieval task, and a fine localization is addressed by means of image retrieval in the previously selected room. Second, global localization, which consists in estimating the position of the robot inside the entire map in a unique step. Besides, an exhaustive study of the loss function influence on the network learning process has been made. The experimental section proves that triplet neural networks are an efficient and robust tool to address the localization of mobile robots in indoor environments, considering real operation conditions.</p>

It makes use of hybrid quantum-classical computation which tries to leverage quantum mechanic principles that allow us to use a different approach to deep learning classification problems. The work presented here falls within the context of the AGILE space mission, launched in 2007 by the Italian Space Agency. We implement different Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) that analyze data acquired by the instruments onboard AGILE to detect Gamma-Ray Bursts from sky maps or light curves. We use several frameworks such as TensorFlow-Quantum, Qiskit and PennyLane to simulate a quantum computer. We achieved an accuracy of 95.1% on sky maps with QCNNs, while the classical counterpart achieved 98.8% on the same data, using however hundreds of thousands more parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dohoon Lee, Kyogu Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of differential equation-based generative modeling, conventional approaches often rely on single-dimensional scalar values as interpolation coefficients during both training and inference phases. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, a multidimensional interpolant that extends these coefficients into multiple dimensions, leveraging the stochastic interpolant framework. Additionally, we propose a novel path optimization problem tailored to adaptively determine multidimensional inference trajectories, with a predetermined differential equation solver and a fixed number of function evaluations. Our solution involves simulation dynamics coupled with adversarial training to optimize the inference path. Notably, employing a multidimensional interpolant during training improves the model's inference performance, even in the absence of path optimization. When the adaptive, multidimensional path derived from our optimization process is employed, it yields further performance gains, even with fixed solver configurations. The introduction of multidimensional interpolants not only enhances the efficacy of models but also opens up a new domain for exploration in training and inference methodologies, emphasizing the potential of multidimensional paths as an untapped frontier.</p>

<p>Abstract: The automobile plays an important role in the economic activities of mankind, especially in the metropolis. Under the circumstances, the demand of quick search for available parking spaces has become a major concern for the automobile drivers. Meanwhile, the public sense of privacy is also awaking, the image-based parking space recognition methods lack the attention of privacy protection. In this paper, we proposed a binary convolutional neural network with lightweight design structure named BCFPL, which can be used to train with low-resolution parking space images and offer a reasonable recognition result. The images of parking space were collected from various complex environments, including different weather, occlusion conditions, and various camera angles. We conducted the training and testing progresses among different datasets and partial subsets. The experimental results show that the accuracy of BCFPL does not decrease compared with the original resolution image directly, and can reach the average level of the existing mainstream method. BCFPL also has low hardware requirements and fast recognition speed while meeting the privacy requirements, so it has application potential in intelligent city construction and automatic driving field.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce phi-3-mini, a 3.8 billion parameter language model trained on 3.3 trillion tokens, whose overall performance, as measured by both academic benchmarks and internal testing, rivals that of models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 (e.g., phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench), despite being small enough to be deployed on a phone. The innovation lies entirely in our dataset for training, a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, composed of heavily filtered web data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format. We also provide some initial parameter-scaling results with a 7B and 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called phi-3-small and phi-3-medium, both significantly more capable than phi-3-mini (e.g., respectively 75% and 78% on MMLU, and 8.7 and 8.9 on MT-bench).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anwesha Das, Zekun Wu, Iza \v{S}krjanec, Anna Maria Feit</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual highlighting can guide user attention in complex interfaces. However, its effectiveness under limited attentional capacities is underexplored. This paper examines the joint impact of visual highlighting (permanent and dynamic) and dual-task-induced cognitive load on gaze behaviour. Our analysis, using eye-movement data from 27 participants viewing 150 unique webpages reveals that while participants' ability to attend to UI elements decreases with increasing cognitive load, dynamic adaptations (i.e., highlighting) remain attention-grabbing. The presence of these factors significantly alters what people attend to and thus what is salient. Accordingly, we show that state-of-the-art saliency models increase their performance when accounting for different cognitive loads. Our empirical insights, along with our openly available dataset, enhance our understanding of attentional processes in UIs under varying cognitive (and perceptual) loads and open the door for new models that can predict user attention while multitasking.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapidly developing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have shown notable capabilities on a range of multi-modal tasks, but still face the hallucination phenomena where the generated texts do not align with the given contexts, significantly restricting the usages of LVLMs. Most previous work detects and mitigates hallucination at the coarse-grained level or requires expensive annotation (e.g., labeling by proprietary models or human experts). To address these issues, we propose detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs via fine-grained AI feedback. The basic idea is that we generate a small-size sentence-level hallucination annotation dataset by proprietary models, whereby we train a hallucination detection model which can perform sentence-level hallucination detection, covering primary hallucination types (i.e., object, attribute, and relationship). Then, we propose a detect-then-rewrite pipeline to automatically construct preference dataset for training hallucination mitigating model. Furthermore, we propose differentiating the severity of hallucinations, and introducing a Hallucination Severity-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (HSA-DPO) for mitigating hallucination in LVLMs by incorporating the severity of hallucinations into preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) broadens the scope of computation and storage beyond the central network, incorporating edge nodes close to end devices. This expansion facilitates the implementation of large-scale "connected things" within edge networks. The advent of applications necessitating real-time, high-quality service presents several challenges, such as low latency, high data rate, reliability, efficiency, and security, all of which demand resolution. The incorporation of reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies within MEC networks promotes a deeper understanding of mobile user behaviors and network dynamics, thereby optimizing resource use in computing and communication processes. This paper offers an exhaustive survey of RL applications in MEC networks, initially presenting an overview of RL from its fundamental principles to the latest advanced frameworks. Furthermore, it outlines various RL strategies employed in offloading, caching, and communication within MEC networks. Finally, it explores open issues linked with software and hardware platforms, representation, RL robustness, safe RL, large-scale scheduling, generalization, security, and privacy. The paper proposes specific RL techniques to mitigate these issues and provides insights into their practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Hou, Jin-Duk Park, Won-Yong Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: A recent study has shown that diffusion models are well-suited for modeling the generative process of user-item interactions in recommender systems due to their denoising nature. However, existing diffusion model-based recommender systems do not explicitly leverage high-order connectivities that contain crucial collaborative signals for accurate recommendations. Addressing this gap, we propose CF-Diff, a new diffusion model-based collaborative filtering (CF) method, which is capable of making full use of collaborative signals along with multi-hop neighbors. Specifically, the forward-diffusion process adds random noise to user-item interactions, while the reverse-denoising process accommodates our own learning model, named cross-attention-guided multi-hop autoencoder (CAM-AE), to gradually recover the original user-item interactions. CAM-AE consists of two core modules: 1) the attention-aided AE module, responsible for precisely learning latent representations of user-item interactions while preserving the model's complexity at manageable levels, and 2) the multi-hop cross-attention module, which judiciously harnesses high-order connectivity information to capture enhanced collaborative signals. Through comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that CF-Diff is (a) Superior: outperforming benchmark recommendation methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 7.29% compared to the best competitor, (b) Theoretically-validated: reducing computations while ensuring that the embeddings generated by our model closely approximate those from the original cross-attention, and (c) Scalable: proving the computational efficiency that scales linearly with the number of users or items.</p>

<p>Abstract: Urbanization challenges underscore the necessity for effective satellite image-text retrieval methods to swiftly access specific information enriched with geographic semantics for urban applications. However, existing methods often overlook significant domain gaps across diverse urban landscapes, primarily focusing on enhancing retrieval performance within single domains. To tackle this issue, we present UrbanCross, a new framework for cross-domain satellite image-text retrieval. UrbanCross leverages a high-quality, cross-domain dataset enriched with extensive geo-tags from three countries to highlight domain diversity. It employs the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for textual refinement and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for visual augmentation, achieving a fine-grained alignment of images, segments and texts, yielding a 10% improvement in retrieval performance. Additionally, UrbanCross incorporates an adaptive curriculum-based source sampler and a weighted adversarial cross-domain fine-tuning module, progressively enhancing adaptability across various domains. Extensive experiments confirm UrbanCross's superior efficiency in retrieval and adaptation to new urban environments, demonstrating an average performance increase of 15% over its version without domain adaptation mechanisms, effectively bridging the domain gap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin-Duk Park, Yong-Min Shin, Won-Yong Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: A series of graph filtering (GF)-based collaborative filtering (CF) showcases state-of-the-art performance on the recommendation accuracy by using a low-pass filter (LPF) without a training process. However, conventional GF-based CF approaches mostly perform matrix decomposition on the item-item similarity graph to realize the ideal LPF, which results in a non-trivial computational cost and thus makes them less practical in scenarios where rapid recommendations are essential. In this paper, we propose Turbo-CF, a GF-based CF method that is both training-free and matrix decomposition-free. Turbo-CF employs a polynomial graph filter to circumvent the issue of expensive matrix decompositions, enabling us to make full use of modern computer hardware components (i.e., GPU). Specifically, Turbo-CF first constructs an item-item similarity graph whose edge weights are effectively regulated. Then, our own polynomial LPFs are designed to retain only low-frequency signals without explicit matrix decompositions. We demonstrate that Turbo-CF is extremely fast yet accurate, achieving a runtime of less than 1 second on real-world benchmark datasets while achieving recommendation accuracies comparable to best competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Ricker, Dennis Assenmacher, Thorsten Holz, Asja Fischer, Erwin Quiring</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongge Han, Trevor McInroe, Adam Jelley, Stefano V. Albrecht, Peter Bell, Amos Storkey</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for robotics applications, particularly task planning, by harnessing their language comprehension and text generation capabilities. However, in applications such as household robotics, a critical gap remains in the personalization of these models to individual user preferences. We introduce LLM-Personalize, a novel framework with an optimization pipeline designed to personalize LLM planners for household robotics. Our LLM-Personalize framework features an LLM planner that performs iterative planning in multi-room, partially-observable household scenarios, making use of a scene graph constructed with local observations. The generated plan consists of a sequence of high-level actions which are subsequently executed by a controller. Central to our approach is the optimization pipeline, which combines imitation learning and iterative self-training to personalize the LLM planner. In particular, the imitation learning phase performs initial LLM alignment from demonstrations, and bootstraps the model to facilitate effective iterative self-training, which further explores and aligns the model to user preferences. We evaluate LLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark for household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than a 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing significantly improved alignment with human preferences.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted extensive attention due to their remarkable performance across various tasks. However, the substantial computational and memory requirements of LLM inference pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios. Efforts within the field have been directed towards developing techniques aimed at enhancing the efficiency of LLM inference. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on efficient LLM inference. We start by analyzing the primary causes of the inefficient LLM inference, i.e., the large model size, the quadratic-complexity attention operation, and the auto-regressive decoding approach. Then, we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the current literature into data-level, model-level, and system-level optimization. Moreover, the paper includes comparative experiments on representative methods within critical sub-fields to provide quantitative insights. Last but not least, we provide some knowledge summary and discuss future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Wan, Guanghua Wan, Shijie Zhang, Hongyu Zhang, Yulei Sui, Pan Zhou, Hai Jin, Lichao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in developing deep learning-based models for automated code completion. Although using source code in GitHub has been a common practice for training deep-learning-based models for code completion, it may induce some legal and ethical issues such as copyright infringement. In this paper, we investigate the legal and ethical issues of current neural code completion models by answering the following question: Is my code used to train your neural code completion model? To this end, we tailor a membership inference approach (termed CodeMI) that was originally crafted for classification tasks to a more challenging task of code completion. In particular, since the target code completion models perform as opaque black boxes, preventing access to their training data and parameters, we opt to train multiple shadow models to mimic their behavior. The acquired posteriors from these shadow models are subsequently employed to train a membership classifier. Subsequently, the membership classifier can be effectively employed to deduce the membership status of a given code sample based on the output of a target code completion model. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of this adapted approach across a diverse array of neural code completion models, (i.e., LSTM-based, CodeGPT, CodeGen, and StarCoder). Experimental results reveal that the LSTM-based and CodeGPT models suffer the membership leakage issue, which can be easily detected by our proposed membership inference approach with an accuracy of 0.842, and 0.730, respectively. Interestingly, our experiments also show that the data membership of current large language models of code, e.g., CodeGen and StarCoder, is difficult to detect, leaving amper space for further improvement. Finally, we also try to explain the findings from the perspective of model memorization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karim G. Habashy, Benjamin D. Evans, Dan F. M. Goodman, Jeffrey S. Bowers</p>
<p>Abstract: Evolution has yielded a diverse set of neurons with varying morphologies and physiological properties that impact their processing of temporal information. In addition, it is known empirically that spike timing is a significant factor in neural computations. However, despite these two observations, most neural network models deal with spatially structured inputs with synchronous time steps, while restricting variation to parameters like weights and biases. In this study, we investigate the relevance of adapting temporal parameters, like time constants and delays, in feedforward networks that map spatio-temporal spike patterns. In this context, we show that networks with richer potential dynamics are able to more easily and robustly learn tasks with temporal structure. Indeed, when adaptation was restricted to weights, networks were unable to solve most problems. We also show strong interactions between the various parameters and the advantages of adapting temporal parameters when dealing with noise in inputs and weights, which might prove useful in neuromorphic hardware design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Shmakov, Kevin Greif, Michael James Fenton, Aishik Ghosh, Pierre Baldi, Daniel Whiteson</p>
<p>Abstract: The measurements performed by particle physics experiments must account for the imperfect response of the detectors used to observe the interactions. One approach, unfolding, statistically adjusts the experimental data for detector effects. Recently, generative machine learning models have shown promise for performing unbinned unfolding in a high number of dimensions. However, all current generative approaches are limited to unfolding a fixed set of observables, making them unable to perform full-event unfolding in the variable dimensional environment of collider data. A novel modification to the variational latent diffusion model (VLD) approach to generative unfolding is presented, which allows for unfolding of high- and variable-dimensional feature spaces. The performance of this method is evaluated in the context of semi-leptonic top quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider.</p>

We explore scalable methods for extracting the subgraph of a vision model's computational graph that underlies recognition of a specific visual concept. We introduce a new method for identifying these subgraphs: specifying a visual concept using a few examples, and then tracing the interdependence of neuron activations across layers, or their functional connectivity. We find that our approach extracts circuits that causally affect model output, and that editing these circuits can defend large pretrained models from adversarial attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantitative and numerical comprehension in language is an important task in many fields like education and finance, but still remains a challenging task for language models. While tool and calculator usage has shown to be helpful to improve mathematical reasoning in large pretrained decoder-only language models, this remains unexplored for smaller language models with encoders. In this paper, we propose Pre-Calc, a simple pre-finetuning objective of learning to use the calculator for both encoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures, formulated as a discriminative and generative task respectively. We pre-train BERT and RoBERTa for discriminative calculator use and Flan-T5 for generative calculator use on the MAWPS, SVAMP, and AsDiv-A datasets, which improves performance on downstream tasks that require numerical understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutao Cheng, Zhao Zhang, Maoke Yang, Hui Nie, Chunyuan Li, Xinglong Wu, Jie Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of graphic design, automating the integration of design elements into a cohesive multi-layered artwork not only boosts productivity but also paves the way for the democratization of graphic design. One existing practice is Graphic Layout Generation (GLG), which aims to layout sequential design elements. It has been constrained by the necessity for a predefined correct sequence of layers, thus limiting creative potential and increasing user workload. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG) as a more flexible and pragmatic setup, which creates graphic composition from unordered sets of design elements. To tackle the HLG task, we introduce Graphist, the first layout generation model based on large multimodal models. Graphist efficiently reframes the HLG as a sequence generation problem, utilizing RGB-A images as input, outputs a JSON draft protocol, indicating the coordinates, size, and order of each element. We develop new evaluation metrics for HLG. Graphist outperforms prior arts and establishes a strong baseline for this field. Project homepage: https://github.com/graphic-design-ai/graphist</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> G\'abor Antal, Rich\'ard Voz\'ar, Rudolf Ferenc</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of advanced neural networks has opened up new ways in automated code generation from conceptual models, promising to enhance software development processes. This paper presents a preliminary evaluation of GPT-4-Vision, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, and its capabilities in transforming Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams into fully operating Java class files. In our study, we used exported images of 18 class diagrams comprising 10 single-class and 8 multi-class diagrams. We used 3 different prompts for each input, and we manually evaluated the results. We created a scoring system in which we scored the occurrence of elements found in the diagram within the source code. On average, the model was able to generate source code for 88% of the elements shown in the diagrams. Our results indicate that GPT-4-Vision exhibits proficiency in handling single-class UML diagrams, successfully transforming them into syntactically correct class files. However, for multi-class UML diagrams, the model's performance is weaker compared to single-class diagrams. In summary, further investigations are necessary to exploit the model's potential completely.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochen Kev Gao, Feng Yao, Kewen Zhao, Beilei He, Animesh Kumar, Vish Krishnan, Jingbo Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Model scaling is becoming the default choice for many language tasks due to the success of large language models (LLMs). However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel. In this paper, we delve into the patent approval pre-diction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data. Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up. Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text. As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses prove that incorporating FLAN Graph via various graph models consistently outperforms all LLM baselines significantly. We hope that our observations and analyses in this paper can bring more attention to this challenging task and prompt further research into the limitations of LLMs. Our source code and dataset can be obtained from http://github.com/ShangDataLab/FLAN-Graph.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced in various fields and intelligent agent applications. However, current LLMs that learn from human or external model supervision are costly and may face performance ceilings as task complexity and diversity increase. To address this issue, self-evolution approaches that enable LLM to autonomously acquire, refine, and learn from experiences generated by the model itself are rapidly growing. This new training paradigm inspired by the human experiential learning process offers the potential to scale LLMs towards superintelligence. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of self-evolution approaches in LLMs. We first propose a conceptual framework for self-evolution and outline the evolving process as iterative cycles composed of four phases: experience acquisition, experience refinement, updating, and evaluation. Second, we categorize the evolution objectives of LLMs and LLM-based agents; then, we summarize the literature and provide taxonomy and insights for each module. Lastly, we pinpoint existing challenges and propose future directions to improve self-evolution frameworks, equipping researchers with critical insights to fast-track the development of self-evolving LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mitodru Niyogi, Arnab Bhattacharya</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present Paramanu-Ganita, a 208 million parameter novel Auto Regressive (AR) decoder based language model on mathematics. The model is pretrained from scratch at context size of 4096 on our curated mixed mathematical corpus. We evaluate our model on both perplexity metric and GSM8k mathematical benchmark. Paramanu-Ganita despite being 35 times smaller than 7B LLMs, outperformed generalist LLMs such as LLaMa-1 7B by 28.4% points, LLaMa-2 7B by 27.6% points, Falcon 7B by 32.6% points, PaLM 8B by 35.3% points, and math specialised LLMs such as Minerva 8B by 23.2% points, and LLEMMA-7B by 3.0% points in GSM8k test accuracy metric respectively. Paramanu-Ganita also outperformed giant LLMs like PaLM 62B by 6.4% points, Falcon 40B by 19.8% points, LLaMa-1 33B by 3.8% points and Vicuna 13B by 11.8% points respectively. The large significant margin improvement in performance of our math model over the existing LLMs signifies that reasoning capabilities of language model are just not restricted to LLMs with humongous number of parameters. Paramanu-Ganita took 146 hours of A100 training whereas math specialised LLM, LLEMMA 7B, was trained for 23,000 A100 hours of training equivalent. Thus, our approach of pretraining powerful domain specialised language models from scratch for domain adaptation is much more cost-effective than performing continual training of LLMs for domain adaptation. Hence, we conclude that for strong mathematical reasoning abilities of language model, we do not need giant LLMs and immense computing power to our end. In the end, we want to point out that we have only trained Paramanu-Ganita only on a part of our entire mathematical corpus and yet to explore the full potential of our model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tokenization is widely used in large language models because it significantly improves performance. However, tokenization imposes several disadvantages, such as performance biases, increased adversarial vulnerability, decreased character-level modeling performance, and increased modeling complexity. To address these disadvantages without sacrificing performance, we propose SpaceByte, a novel byte-level decoder architecture that closes the performance gap between byte-level and subword autoregressive language modeling. SpaceByte consists of a byte-level Transformer model, but with extra larger transformer blocks inserted in the middle of the layers. We find that performance is significantly improved by applying these larger blocks only after certain bytes, such as space characters, which typically denote word boundaries. Our experiments show that for a fixed training and inference compute budget, SpaceByte outperforms other byte-level architectures and roughly matches the performance of tokenized Transformer architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm in multi-agent reinforcement learning, emphasizing the utilization of global information for learning an enhanced joint $Q$-function or centralized critic. In contrast, our investigation delves into harnessing global information to directly enhance individual $Q$-functions or individual actors. Notably, we discover that applying identical global information universally across all agents proves insufficient for optimal performance. Consequently, we advocate for the customization of global information tailored to each agent, creating agent-personalized global information to bolster overall performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel paradigm named Personalized Training with Distilled Execution (PTDE), wherein agent-personalized global information is distilled into the agent's local information. This distilled information is then utilized during decentralized execution, resulting in minimal performance degradation. PTDE can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms, leading to notable performance enhancements across diverse benchmarks, including the SMAC benchmark, Google Research Football (GRF) benchmark, and Learning to Rank (LTR) task.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, badminton analytics has drawn attention due to the advancement of artificial intelligence and the efficiency of data collection. While there is a line of effective applications to improve and investigate player performance, there are only a few public badminton datasets that can be used by researchers outside the badminton domain. Existing badminton singles datasets focus on specific matchups; however, they cannot provide comprehensive studies on different players and various matchups. In this paper, we provide a badminton singles dataset, ShuttleSet22, which is collected from high-ranking matches in 2022. ShuttleSet22 consists of 30,172 strokes in 2,888 rallies in the training set, 1,400 strokes in 450 rallies in the validation set, and 2,040 strokes in 654 rallies in the testing set, with detailed stroke-level metadata within a rally. To benchmark existing work with ShuttleSet22, we hold a challenge, Track 2: Forecasting Future Turn-Based Strokes in Badminton Rallies, at CoachAI Badminton Challenge @ IJCAI 2023, to encourage researchers to tackle this real-world problem through innovative approaches and to summarize insights between the state-of-the-art baseline and improved techniques, exchanging inspiring ideas.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lang Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning capabilities, particularly when guided by specifically designed prompts in complex reasoning tasks such as math word problems. These models typically solve tasks using a chain-of-thought approach, which not only bolsters their reasoning abilities but also provides valuable insights into their problem-solving process. However, there is still significant room for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Some studies suggest that the integration of an LLM output verifier can boost reasoning accuracy without necessitating additional model training. In this paper, we follow these studies and introduce a novel graph-based method to further augment the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We posit that multiple solutions to a reasoning task, generated by an LLM, can be represented as a reasoning graph due to the logical connections between intermediate steps from different reasoning paths. Therefore, we propose the Reasoning Graph Verifier (GraphReason) to analyze and verify the solutions generated by LLMs. By evaluating these graphs, models can yield more accurate and reliable results.Our experimental results show that our graph-based verification method not only significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs but also outperforms existing verifier methods in terms of improving these models' reasoning performance.</p>

Participants' decisions were based mainly on linguistic style (35%) and socioemotional traits (27%), supporting the idea that intelligence, narrowly conceived, is not sufficient to pass the Turing test. Participant knowledge about LLMs and number of games played positively correlated with accuracy in detecting AI, suggesting learning and practice as possible strategies to mitigate deception. Despite known limitations as a test of intelligence, we argue that the Turing test continues to be relevant as an assessment of naturalistic communication and deception.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Zhou, Bin Hu, Chenyang Zhao, Pu Zhang, Bin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in addressing complex sequential decision-making tasks through the provision of high-level instructions. However, LLM-based agents lack specialization in tackling specific target problems, particularly in real-time dynamic environments. Additionally, deploying an LLM-based agent in practical scenarios can be both costly and time-consuming. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) approaches train agents that specialize in the target task but often suffer from low sampling efficiency and high exploration costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that addresses these challenges by training a smaller, specialized student RL agent using instructions from an LLM-based teacher agent. By incorporating the guidance from the teacher agent, the student agent can distill the prior knowledge of the LLM into its own model. Consequently, the student agent can be trained with significantly less data. Moreover, through further training with environment feedback, the student agent surpasses the capabilities of its teacher for completing the target task. We conducted experiments on challenging MiniGrid and Habitat environments, specifically designed for embodied AI research, to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework. The results clearly demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to strong baseline methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZJLAB-AMMI/LLM4Teach.</p>

While effective for logical tasks, CoT is not conducive to creative problem-solving which often requires out-of-box thoughts and is crucial for innovation advancements. In this paper, we explore the Leap-of-Thought (LoT) abilities within LLMs -- a non-sequential, creative paradigm involving strong associations and knowledge leaps. To this end, we study LLMs on the popular Oogiri game which needs participants to have good creativity and strong associative thinking for responding unexpectedly and humorously to the given image, text, or both, and thus is suitable for LoT study. Then to investigate LLMs' LoT ability in the Oogiri game, we first build a multimodal and multilingual Oogiri-GO dataset which contains over 130,000 samples from the Oogiri game, and observe the insufficient LoT ability or failures of most existing LLMs on the Oogiri game. Accordingly, we introduce a creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) paradigm to improve LLM's LoT ability. CLoT first formulates the Oogiri-GO dataset into LoT-oriented instruction tuning data to train pretrained LLM for achieving certain LoT humor generation and discrimination abilities. Then CLoT designs an explorative self-refinement that encourages the LLM to generate more creative LoT data via exploring parallels between seemingly unrelated concepts and selects high-quality data to train itself for self-refinement. CLoT not only excels in humor generation in the Oogiri game but also boosts creative abilities in various tasks like cloud guessing game and divergent association task. These findings advance our understanding and offer a pathway to improve LLMs' creative capacities for innovative applications across domains. The dataset, code, and models will be released online. https://zhongshsh.github.io/CLoT/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: Controlling continuous-time dynamical systems is generally a two step process: first, identify or model the system dynamics with differential equations, then, minimize the control objectives to achieve optimal control function and optimal state trajectories. However, any inaccuracy in dynamics modeling will lead to sub-optimality in the resulting control function. To address this, we propose a neural ODE based method for controlling unknown dynamical systems, denoted as Neural Control (NC), which combines dynamics identification and optimal control learning using a coupled neural ODE. Through an intriguing interplay between the two neural networks in coupled neural ODE structure, our model concurrently learns system dynamics as well as optimal controls that guides towards target states. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for learning optimal control of unknown dynamical systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Quan Chong, Jiaoyang Li, Katia Sycara</p>
<p>Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem entails finding collision-free paths for a set of agents, guiding them from their start to goal locations. However, MAPF does not account for several practical task-related constraints. For example, agents may need to perform actions at goal locations with specific execution times, adhering to predetermined orders and timeframes. Moreover, goal assignments may not be predefined for agents, and the optimization objective may lack an explicit definition. To incorporate task assignment, path planning, and a user-defined objective into a coherent framework, this paper examines the Task Assignment and Path Finding with Precedence and Temporal Constraints (TAPF-PTC) problem. We augment Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to simultaneously generate task assignments and collision-free paths that adhere to precedence and temporal constraints, maximizing an objective quantified by the return from a user-defined reward function in reinforcement learning (RL). Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm, CBS-TA-PTC, can solve highly challenging bomb-defusing tasks with precedence and temporal constraints efficiently relative to MARL and adapted Target Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quentin Gallou\'edec, Edward Beeching, Cl\'ement Romac, Emmanuel Dellandr\'ea</p>
<p>Abstract: The search for a general model that can operate seamlessly across multiple domains remains a key goal in machine learning research. The prevailing methodology in Reinforcement Learning (RL) typically limits models to a single task within a unimodal framework, a limitation that contrasts with the broader vision of a versatile, multi-domain model. In this paper, we present Jack of All Trades (JAT), a transformer-based model with a unique design optimized for handling sequential decision-making tasks and multimodal data types. The JAT model demonstrates its robust capabilities and versatility by achieving strong performance on very different RL benchmarks, along with promising results on Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, all using a single set of weights. The JAT model marks a significant step towards more general, cross-domain AI model design, and notably, it is the first model of its kind to be fully open-sourced (see https://huggingface.co/jat-project/jat), including a pioneering general-purpose dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaokai Zhang, Na Zhu, Cheng Qin, Yang Li, Zhenbing Zeng, Tuo Leng</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometric problem solving has always been a long-standing challenge in the fields of automated reasoning and artificial intelligence. We built a neural-symbolic system to automatically perform human-like geometric deductive reasoning. The symbolic part is a formal system built on FormalGeo, which can automatically perform geomertic relational reasoning and algebraic calculations and organize the solving process into a solution hypertree with conditions as hypernodes and theorems as hyperedges. The neural part, called HyperGNet, is a hypergraph neural network based on the attention mechanism, including a encoder to effectively encode the structural and semantic information of the hypertree, and a solver to provide problem-solving guidance. The neural part predicts theorems according to the hypertree, and the symbolic part applies theorems and updates the hypertree, thus forming a predict-apply cycle to ultimately achieve readable and traceable automatic solving of geometric problems. Experiments demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of this neural-symbolic architecture. We achieved a step-wised accuracy of 87.65% and an overall accuracy of 85.53% on the formalgeo7k datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew J. Peterson</p>
<p>Abstract: While artificial intelligence has the potential to process vast amounts of data, generate new insights, and unlock greater productivity, its widespread adoption may entail unforeseen consequences. We identify conditions under which AI, by reducing the cost of access to certain modes of knowledge, can paradoxically harm public understanding. While large language models are trained on vast amounts of diverse data, they naturally generate output towards the 'center' of the distribution. This is generally useful, but widespread reliance on recursive AI systems could lead to a process we define as "knowledge collapse", and argue this could harm innovation and the richness of human understanding and culture. However, unlike AI models that cannot choose what data they are trained on, humans may strategically seek out diverse forms of knowledge if they perceive them to be worthwhile. To investigate this, we provide a simple model in which a community of learners or innovators choose to use traditional methods or to rely on a discounted AI-assisted process and identify conditions under which knowledge collapse occurs. In our default model, a 20% discount on AI-generated content generates public beliefs 2.3 times further from the truth than when there is no discount. An empirical approach to measuring the distribution of LLM outputs is provided in theoretical terms and illustrated through a specific example comparing the diversity of outputs across different models and prompting styles. Finally, based on the results, we consider further research directions to counteract such outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiefeng Zhou, Zhen Li, Yong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Random walk is an explainable approach for modeling natural processes at the molecular level. The Random Permutation Set Theory (RPST) serves as a framework for uncertainty reasoning, extending the applicability of Dempster-Shafer Theory. Recent explorations indicate a promising link between RPST and random walk. In this study, we conduct an analysis and construct a random walk model based on the properties of RPST, with Monte Carlo simulations of such random walk. Our findings reveal that the random walk generated through RPST exhibits characteristics similar to those of a Gaussian random walk and can be transformed into a Wiener process through a specific limiting scaling procedure. This investigation establishes a novel connection between RPST and random walk theory, thereby not only expanding the applicability of RPST, but also demonstrating the potential for combining the strengths of both approaches to improve problem-solving abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Stefik</p>
<p>Abstract: It is hard to build robots (including telerobots) that are useful, and harder to build autonomous robots that are robust and general. Current robots are built using manual programming, mathematical models, planning frameworks, and reinforcement learning. These methods do not lead to the leaps in performance and generality seen with deep learning, generative AI, and foundation models (FMs). Today's robots do not learn to provide home care, to be nursing assistants, or to do household chores and other services reliably. Addressing the aspirational opportunities of robot service applications requires improving the path to get there. The high cost of bipedal multi-sensory robots ("bodies") is a significant obstacle for both research and deployment. A deeper issue is that mainstream FMs ("minds") do not support sensing and acting in the world. They do not lead to robots that experiment, communicate, or collaborate. They do not lead to robots that learn from and with others. They do not lead to robots that know enough to be deployed in service applications. This paper focuses on what service robots need to know. It recommends developing experiential FMs for bootstrapping service robots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yimin Tang, Sven Koenig, Jiaoyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), i.e., finding collision-free paths for multiple robots, plays a critical role in many applications. Sometimes, assigning a target to each agent also presents a challenge. The Combined Target-Assignment and Path-Finding (TAPF) problem, a variant of MAPF, requires one to simultaneously assign targets to agents and plan collision-free paths for agents. Several algorithms, including CBM, CBS-TA, and ITA-CBS, optimally solve the TAPF problem, with ITA-CBS being the leading algorithm for minimizing flowtime. However, the only existing bounded-suboptimal algorithm ECBS-TA is derived from CBS-TA rather than ITA-CBS. So, it faces the same issues as CBS-TA, such as searching through multiple constraint trees and spending too much time on finding the next-best target assignment. We introduce ITA-ECBS, the first bounded-suboptimal variant of ITA-CBS. Transforming ITA-CBS to its bounded-suboptimal variant is challenging because different constraint tree nodes can have different assignments of targets to agents. ITA-ECBS uses focal search to achieve efficiency and determines target assignments based on a new lower bound matrix. We show that it runs faster than ECBS-TA in 87.42% of 54,033 test cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senkang Hu, Zhengru Fang, Zihan Fang, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Connected and autonomous driving is developing rapidly in recent years. However, current autonomous driving systems, which are primarily based on data-driven approaches, exhibit deficiencies in interpretability, generalization, and continuing learning capabilities. In addition, the single-vehicle autonomous driving systems lack of the ability of collaboration and negotiation with other vehicles, which is crucial for the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems. In order to address these issues, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to develop a novel framework, AgentsCoDriver, to enable multiple vehicles to conduct collaborative driving. AgentsCoDriver consists of five modules: observation module, reasoning engine, cognitive memory module, reinforcement reflection module, and communication module. It can accumulate knowledge, lessons, and experiences over time by continuously interacting with the environment, thereby making itself capable of lifelong learning. In addition, by leveraging the communication module, different agents can exchange information and realize negotiation and collaboration in complex traffic environments. Extensive experiments are conducted and show the superiority of AgentsCoDriver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Dalvi, Neil Ashtekar, Vasant Honavar</p>
<p>Abstract: Matching is one of the simplest approaches for estimating causal effects from observational data. Matching techniques compare the observed outcomes across pairs of individuals with similar covariate values but different treatment statuses in order to estimate causal effects. However, traditional matching techniques are unreliable given high-dimensional covariates due to the infamous curse of dimensionality. To overcome this challenge, we propose a simple, fast, yet highly effective approach to matching using Random Hyperplane Tessellations (RHPT). First, we prove that the RHPT representation is an approximate balancing score -- thus maintaining the strong ignorability assumption -- and provide empirical evidence for this claim. Second, we report results of extensive experiments showing that matching using RHPT outperforms traditional matching techniques and is competitive with state-of-the-art deep learning methods for causal effect estimation. In addition, RHPT avoids the need for computationally expensive training of deep neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zooey Nguyen, Anthony Annunziata, Vinh Luong, Sang Dinh, Quynh Le, Anh Hai Ha, Chanh Le, Hong An Phan, Shruti Raghavan, Christopher Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of domain-specific model fine-tuning and of reasoning mechanisms on the performance of question-answering (Q&A) systems powered by large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Using the FinanceBench SEC financial filings dataset, we observe that, for RAG, combining a fine-tuned embedding model with a fine-tuned LLM achieves better accuracy than generic models, with relatively greater gains attributable to fine-tuned embedding models. Additionally, employing reasoning iterations on top of RAG delivers an even bigger jump in performance, enabling the Q&A systems to get closer to human-expert quality. We discuss the implications of such findings, propose a structured technical design space capturing major technical components of Q&A AI, and provide recommendations for making high-impact technical choices for such components. We plan to follow up on this work with actionable guides for AI teams and further investigations into the impact of domain-specific augmentation in RAG and into agentic AI capabilities such as advanced planning and reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Intelligent vehicles have demonstrated excellent capabilities in many transportation scenarios, but the complex on-board sensors and the inference capabilities of on-board neural networks limit the accuracy of intelligent vehicles for accident detection in complex transportation systems. In this paper, we present AccidentBlip2, a pure vision-based multimodal large model Blip2 accident detection method. Our method first processes the multi-view through ViT-14g and inputs the multi-view features into the cross attention layer of the Qformer, while our self-designed Motion Qformer replaces the self-attention layer in Blip2's Qformer with the Temporal Attention layer in the In the inference process, the query generated in the previous frame is input into the Temporal Attention layer to realize the inference for temporal information. Then we detect whether there is an accident in the surrounding environment by performing autoregressive inference on the query input to the MLP. We also extend our approach to a multi-vehicle cooperative system by deploying Motion Qformer on each vehicle and simultaneously inputting the inference-generated query into the MLP for autoregressive inference. Our approach detects the accuracy of existing video large language models and also adapts to multi-vehicle systems, making it more applicable to intelligent transportation scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Doerr, Yassine Ghannane, Marouane Ibn Brahim</p>
<p>Abstract: While the theoretical analysis of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) has made significant progress for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems in the last 25 years, only sporadic theoretical results exist on how EAs solve permutation-based problems.
  To overcome the lack of permutation-based benchmark problems, we propose a general way to transfer the classic pseudo-Boolean benchmarks into benchmarks defined on sets of permutations. We then conduct a rigorous runtime analysis of the permutation-based $(1+1)$ EA proposed by Scharnow, Tinnefeld, and Wegener (2004) on the analogues of the LeadingOnes and Jump benchmarks. The latter shows that, different from bit-strings, it is not only the Hamming distance that determines how difficult it is to mutate a permutation $\sigma$ into another one $\tau$, but also the precise cycle structure of $\sigma \tau^{-1}$. For this reason, we also regard the more symmetric scramble mutation operator. We observe that it not only leads to simpler proofs, but also reduces the runtime on jump functions with odd jump size by a factor of $\Theta(n)$. Finally, we show that a heavy-tailed version of the scramble operator, as in the bit-string case, leads to a speed-up of order $m^{\Theta(m)}$ on jump functions with jump size $m$. A short empirical analysis confirms these findings, but also reveals that small implementation details like the rate of void mutations can make an important difference.</p>

<p>Abstract: The vector autoregressive (VAR) model has been used to describe the dependence within and across multiple time series. This is a model for stationary time series which can be extended to allow the presence of a deterministic trend in each series. Detrending the data either parametrically or nonparametrically before fitting the VAR model gives rise to more errors in the latter part. In this study, we propose a new approach called DeepVARwT that employs deep learning methodology for maximum likelihood estimation of the trend and the dependence structure at the same time. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used for this purpose. To ensure the stability of the model, we enforce the causality condition on the autoregressive coefficients using the transformation of Ansley & Kohn (1986). We provide a simulation study and an application to real data. In the simulation study, we use realistic trend functions generated from real data and compare the estimates with true function/parameter values. In the real data application, we compare the prediction performance of this model with state-of-the-art models in the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie, Farzan Farnia</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpreting neural network classifiers using gradient-based saliency maps has been extensively studied in the deep learning literature. While the existing algorithms manage to achieve satisfactory performance in application to standard image recognition datasets, recent works demonstrate the vulnerability of widely-used gradient-based interpretation schemes to norm-bounded perturbations adversarially designed for every individual input sample. However, such adversarial perturbations are commonly designed using the knowledge of an input sample, and hence perform sub-optimally in application to an unknown or constantly changing data point. In this paper, we show the existence of a Universal Perturbation for Interpretation (UPI) for standard image datasets, which can alter a gradient-based feature map of neural networks over a significant fraction of test samples. To design such a UPI, we propose a gradient-based optimization method as well as a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach to compute a UPI which can effectively alter a neural network's gradient-based interpretation on different samples. We support the proposed UPI approaches by presenting several numerical results of their successful applications to standard image datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art synthesis quality on both visual and audio tasks, and recent works further adapt them to textual data by diffusing on the embedding space. In this paper, we conduct systematic studies of the optimization challenges encountered with both the embedding space and the denoising model, which have not been carefully explored. Firstly, the data distribution is learnable for embeddings, which may lead to the collapse of the embedding space and unstable training. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new objective called the anchor loss which is more efficient than previous methods. Secondly, we find the noise levels of conventional schedules are insufficient for training a desirable denoising model while introducing varying degrees of degeneration in consequence. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called noise rescaling. Based on the above analysis, we propose Difformer, an embedding diffusion model based on Transformer. Experiments on varieties of seminal text generation tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed methods and the superiority of Difformer over previous state-of-the-art embedding diffusion baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unlike human daily activities, existing publicly available sensor datasets for work activity recognition in industrial domains are limited by difficulties in collecting realistic data as close collaboration with industrial sites is required. This also limits research on and development of methods for industrial applications. To address these challenges and contribute to research on machine recognition of work activities in industrial domains, in this study, we introduce a new large-scale dataset for packaging work recognition called OpenPack. OpenPack contains 53.8 hours of multimodal sensor data, including acceleration data, keypoints, depth images, and readings from IoT-enabled devices (e.g., handheld barcode scanners), collected from 16 distinct subjects with different levels of packaging work experience. We apply state-of-the-art human activity recognition techniques to the dataset and provide future directions of complex work activity recognition studies in the pervasive computing community based on the results. We believe that OpenPack will contribute to the sensor-based action/activity recognition community by providing challenging tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arvindh Arun, Aakash Aanegola, Amul Agrawal, Ramasuri Narayanam, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Representation Learning on graphs is gaining traction due to the increasing abundance of unlabelled network data and the compactness, richness, and usefulness of the representations generated. In this context, the need to consider fairness and bias constraints while generating the representations has been well-motivated and studied to some extent in prior works. One major limitation of most of the prior works in this setting is that they do not aim to address the bias generated due to connectivity patterns in the graphs, such as varied node centrality, which leads to a disproportionate performance across nodes. In our work, we aim to address this issue of mitigating bias due to inherent graph structure in an unsupervised setting. To this end, we propose CAFIN, a centrality-aware fairness-inducing framework that leverages the structural information of graphs to tune the representations generated by existing frameworks. We deploy it on GraphSAGE (a popular framework in this domain) and showcase its efficacy on two downstream tasks - Node Classification and Link Prediction. Empirically, CAFIN consistently reduces the performance disparity across popular datasets (varying from 18 to 80% reduction in performance disparity) from various domains while incurring only a minimal cost of fairness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) suffer from severe inefficiency. It is mainly caused by the exponential growth of node dependency with the increase of layers. It extremely limits the application of stochastic optimization algorithms so that the training of GNN is usually time-consuming. To address this problem, we propose to decouple a multi-layer GNN as multiple simple modules for more efficient training, which is comprised of classical forward training (FT)and designed backward training (BT). Under the proposed framework, each module can be trained efficiently in FT by stochastic algorithms without distortion of graph information owing to its simplicity. To avoid the only unidirectional information delivery of FT and sufficiently train shallow modules with the deeper ones, we develop a backward training mechanism that makes the former modules perceive the latter modules. The backward training introduces the reversed information delivery into the decoupled modules as well as the forward information delivery. To investigate how the decoupling and greedy training affect the representational capacity, we theoretically prove that the error produced by linear modules will not accumulate on unsupervised tasks in most cases. The theoretical and experimental results show that the proposed framework is highly efficient with reasonable performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Etienne Le Naour, Louis Serrano, L\'eon Migus, Yuan Yin, Ghislain Agoua, Nicolas Baskiotis, Patrick Gallinari, Vincent Guigue</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel modeling approach for time series imputation and forecasting, tailored to address the challenges often encountered in real-world data, such as irregular samples, missing data, or unaligned measurements from multiple sensors. Our method relies on a continuous-time-dependent model of the series' evolution dynamics. It leverages adaptations of conditional, implicit neural representations for sequential data. A modulation mechanism, driven by a meta-learning algorithm, allows adaptation to unseen samples and extrapolation beyond observed time-windows for long-term predictions. The model provides a highly flexible and unified framework for imputation and forecasting tasks across a wide range of challenging scenarios. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on classical benchmarks and outperforms alternative time-continuous models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiatong Li, Yunqing Liu, Wenqi Fan, Xiao-Yong Wei, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecule discovery plays a crucial role in various scientific fields, advancing the design of tailored materials and drugs. However, most of the existing methods heavily rely on domain experts, require excessive computational cost, or suffer from sub-optimal performance. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have shown remarkable performance in various cross-modal tasks due to their powerful capabilities in natural language understanding, generalization, and in-context learning (ICL), which provides unprecedented opportunities to advance molecule discovery. Despite several previous works trying to apply LLMs in this task, the lack of domain-specific corpus and difficulties in training specialized LLMs still remain challenges. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based framework (MolReGPT) for molecule-caption translation, where an In-Context Few-Shot Molecule Learning paradigm is introduced to empower molecule discovery with LLMs like ChatGPT to perform their in-context learning capability without domain-specific pre-training and fine-tuning. MolReGPT leverages the principle of molecular similarity to retrieve similar molecules and their text descriptions from a local database to enable LLMs to learn the task knowledge from context examples. We evaluate the effectiveness of MolReGPT on molecule-caption translation, including molecule understanding and text-based molecule generation. Experimental results show that compared to fine-tuned models, MolReGPT outperforms MolT5-base and is comparable to MolT5-large without additional training. To the best of our knowledge, MolReGPT is the first work to leverage LLMs via in-context learning in molecule-caption translation for advancing molecule discovery. Our work expands the scope of LLM applications, as well as providing a new paradigm for molecule discovery and design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Weiming Lu, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Various industries such as finance, meteorology, and energy generate vast amounts of heterogeneous data every day. There is a natural demand for humans to manage, process, and display data efficiently. However, it necessitates labor-intensive efforts and a high level of expertise for these data-related tasks. Considering that large language models (LLMs) have showcased promising capabilities in semantic understanding and reasoning, we advocate that the deployment of LLMs could autonomously manage and process massive amounts of data while displaying and interacting in a human-friendly manner. Based on this belief, we propose Data-Copilot, an LLM-based system that connects numerous data sources on one end and caters to diverse human demands on the other end. Acting like an experienced expert, Data-Copilot autonomously transforms raw data into visualization results that best match the user's intent. Specifically, Data-Copilot autonomously designs versatile interfaces (tools) for data management, processing, prediction, and visualization. In real-time response, it automatically deploys a concise workflow by invoking corresponding interfaces step by step for the user's request. The interface design and deployment processes are fully controlled by Data-Copilot itself, without human assistance. Besides, we create a Data-Copilot demo that links abundant data from different domains (stock, fund, company, economics, and live news) and accurately respond to diverse requests, serving as a reliable AI assistant.</p>

<p>Abstract: The autonomous driving community has witnessed a rapid growth in approaches that embrace an end-to-end algorithm framework, utilizing raw sensor input to generate vehicle motion plans, instead of concentrating on individual tasks such as detection and motion prediction. End-to-end systems, in comparison to modular pipelines, benefit from joint feature optimization for perception and planning. This field has flourished due to the availability of large-scale datasets, closed-loop evaluation, and the increasing need for autonomous driving algorithms to perform effectively in challenging scenarios. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of more than 270 papers, covering the motivation, roadmap, methodology, challenges, and future trends in end-to-end autonomous driving. We delve into several critical challenges, including multi-modality, interpretability, causal confusion, robustness, and world models, amongst others. Additionally, we discuss current advancements in foundation models and visual pre-training, as well as how to incorporate these techniques within the end-to-end driving framework. we maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and open-source projects at https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/End-to-end-Autonomous-Driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihuai Zhao, Wenqi Fan, Jiatong Li, Yunqing Liu, Xiaowei Mei, Yiqi Wang, Zhen Wen, Fei Wang, Xiangyu Zhao, Jiliang Tang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the prosperity of e-commerce and web applications, Recommender Systems (RecSys) have become an important component of our daily life, providing personalized suggestions that cater to user preferences. While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made significant advancements in enhancing recommender systems by modeling user-item interactions and incorporating textual side information, DNN-based methods still face limitations, such as difficulties in understanding users' interests and capturing textual side information, inabilities in generalizing to various recommendation scenarios and reasoning on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding and generation, as well as impressive generalization and reasoning capabilities. As a result, recent studies have attempted to harness the power of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems, to provide researchers in relevant fields with an in-depth understanding. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of LLM-empowered recommender systems from various aspects including Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Prompting. More specifically, we first introduce representative methods to harness the power of LLMs (as a feature encoder) for learning representations of users and items. Then, we review recent techniques of LLMs for enhancing recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss future directions in this emerging field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Jin, Zifeng Wang, Charalampos S. Floudas, Fangyuan Chen, Changlin Gong, Dara Bracken-Clarke, Elisabetta Xue, Yifan Yang, Jimeng Sun, Zhiyong Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical trials are often hindered by the challenge of patient recruitment. In this work, we introduce TrialGPT, a first-of-its-kind large language model (LLM) framework to assist patient-to-trial matching. Given a patient note, TrialGPT predicts the patient's eligibility on a criterion-by-criterion basis and then consolidates these predictions to assess the patient's eligibility for the target trial. We evaluate the trial-level prediction performance of TrialGPT on three publicly available cohorts of 184 patients with over 18,000 trial annotations. We also engaged three physicians to label over 1,000 patient-criterion pairs to assess its criterion-level prediction accuracy. Experimental results show that TrialGPT achieves a criterion-level accuracy of 87.3% with faithful explanations, close to the expert performance (88.7%-90.0%). The aggregated TrialGPT scores are highly correlated with human eligibility judgments, and they outperform the best-competing models by 32.6% to 57.2% in ranking and excluding clinical trials. Furthermore, our user study reveals that TrialGPT can significantly reduce the screening time (by 42.6%) in a real-life clinical trial matching task. These results and analyses have demonstrated promising opportunities for clinical trial matching with LLMs such as TrialGPT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Structured pruning is a widely used technique for reducing the size of pre-trained language models (PLMs), but current methods often overlook the potential of compressing the hidden dimension (d) in PLMs, a dimension critical to model size and efficiency. This paper introduces a novel structured pruning approach, Structured Pruning with PCA Projection (SP3), targeting the effective reduction of d by projecting features into a space defined by principal components before masking. Extensive experiments on benchmarks (GLUE and SQuAD) show that SP3 can reduce d by 70%, compress 94% of the BERTbase model, maintain over 96% accuracy, and outperform other methods that compress d by 6% in accuracy at the same compression ratio. SP3 has also proven effective with other models, including OPT and Llama. Our data and code are available at an anonymous repo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingting Zhu, Bo Peng, Jifan Liang, Tingchen Han, Hai Wan, Jingqiao Fu, Junjie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic communications (SC) have been expected to be a new paradigm shifting to catalyze the next generation communication, whose main concerns shift from accurate bit transmission to effective semantic information exchange in communications. However, the previous and widely-used metrics for images are not applicable to evaluate the image semantic similarity in SC. Classical metrics to measure the similarity between two images usually rely on the pixel level or the structural level, such as the PSNR and the MS-SSIM. Straightforwardly using some tailored metrics based on deep-learning methods in CV community, such as the LPIPS, is infeasible for SC. To tackle this, inspired by BERTScore in NLP community, we propose a novel metric for evaluating image semantic similarity, named Vision Transformer Score (ViTScore). We prove theoretically that ViTScore has 3 important properties, including symmetry, boundedness, and normalization, which make ViTScore convenient and intuitive for image measurement. To evaluate the performance of ViTScore, we compare ViTScore with 3 typical metrics (PSNR, MS-SSIM, and LPIPS) through 4 classes of experiments: (i) correlation with BERTScore through evaluation of image caption downstream CV task, (ii) evaluation in classical image communications, (iii) evaluation in image semantic communication systems, and (iv) evaluation in image semantic communication systems with semantic attack. Experimental results demonstrate that ViTScore is robust and efficient in evaluating the semantic similarity of images. Particularly, ViTScore outperforms the other 3 typical metrics in evaluating the image semantic changes by semantic attack, such as image inverse with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This indicates that ViTScore is an effective performance metric when deployed in SC scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in clinical applications. With the advent of advanced algorithms, various deep learning models have been adopted for ECG tasks. However, the potential of Transformers for ECG data is not yet realized, despite their widespread success in computer vision and natural language processing. In this work, we present a useful masked Transformer method for ECG classification referred to as MTECG, which expands the application of masked autoencoders to ECG time series. We construct a dataset comprising 220,251 ECG recordings with a broad range of diagnoses annoated by medical experts to explore the properties of MTECG. Under the proposed training strategies, a lightweight model with 5.7M parameters performs stably well on a broad range of masking ratios (5%-75%). The ablation studies highlight the importance of fluctuated reconstruction targets, training schedule length, layer-wise LR decay and DropPath rate. The experiments on both private and public ECG datasets demonstrate that MTECG-T significantly outperforms the recent state-of-the-art algorithms in ECG classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henry Hengyuan Zhao, Pichao Wang, Yuyang Zhao, Hao Luo, Fan Wang, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision transformers have strong representation benefits to various downstream tasks. Recently, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed, and their experiments demonstrate that tuning only 1% of extra parameters could surpass full fine-tuning in low-data resource scenarios. However, these methods overlook the task-specific information when fine-tuning diverse downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method called "Salient Channel Tuning" (SCT) to leverage the task-specific information by forwarding the model with the task images to select partial channels in a feature map that enables us to tune only 1/8 channels leading to significantly lower parameter costs. Experiments outperform full fine-tuning on 18 out of 19 tasks in the VTAB-1K benchmark by adding only 0.11M parameters of the ViT-B, which is 780x fewer than its full fine-tuning counterpart. Furthermore, experiments on domain generalization and few-shot learning surpass other PEFT methods with lower parameter costs, demonstrating our proposed tuning technique's strong capability and effectiveness in the low-data regime.</p>

<p>Abstract: The agility of animals, particularly in complex activities such as running, turning, jumping, and backflipping, stands as an exemplar for robotic system design. Transferring this suite of behaviors to legged robotic systems introduces essential inquiries: How can a robot be trained to learn multiple locomotion behaviors simultaneously? How can the robot execute these tasks with a smooth transition? How to integrate these skills for wide-range applications? This paper introduces the Versatile Instructable Motion prior (VIM) - a Reinforcement Learning framework designed to incorporate a range of agile locomotion tasks suitable for advanced robotic applications. Our framework enables legged robots to learn diverse agile low-level skills by imitating animal motions and manually designed motions. Our Functionality reward guides the robot's ability to adopt varied skills, and our Stylization reward ensures that robot motions align with reference motions. Our evaluations of the VIM framework span both simulation environments and real-world deployment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that allows a robot to concurrently learn diverse agile locomotion skills using a single learning-based controller in the real world.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02226">Think before you speak: Training Language Models With Pause Tokens</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sachin Goyal, Ziwei Ji, Ankit Singh Rawat, Aditya Krishna Menon, Sanjiv Kumar, Vaishnavh Nagarajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models generate responses by producing a series of tokens in immediate succession: the $(K+1)^{th}$ token is an outcome of manipulating $K$ hidden vectors per layer, one vector per preceding token. What if instead we were to let the model manipulate say, $K+10$ hidden vectors, before it outputs the $(K+1)^{th}$ token? We operationalize this idea by performing training and inference on language models with a (learnable) $\textit{pause}$ token, a sequence of which is appended to the input prefix. We then delay extracting the model's outputs until the last pause token is seen, thereby allowing the model to process extra computation before committing to an answer. We empirically evaluate $\textit{pause-training}$ on decoder-only models of 1B and 130M parameters with causal pretraining on C4, and on downstream tasks covering reasoning, question-answering, general understanding and fact recall. Our main finding is that inference-time delays show gains when the model is both pre-trained and finetuned with delays. For the 1B model, we witness gains on 8 of 9 tasks, most prominently, a gain of $18\%$ EM score on the QA task of SQuAD, $8\%$ on CommonSenseQA and $1\%$ accuracy on the reasoning task of GSM8k. Our work raises a range of conceptual and practical future research questions on making delayed next-token prediction a widely applicable new paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulan Hu, Zhirui Yang, Sheng Ouyang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown significant potential and has garnered increasing interest in graph learning. However, particularly for generative SSL methods, its potential in Heterogeneous Graph Learning (HGL) remains relatively underexplored. Generative SSL utilizes an encoder to map the input graph into a latent representation and a decoder to recover the input graph from the latent representation. Previous HGL SSL methods generally design complex strategies to capture graph heterogeneity, which heavily rely on contrastive view construction strategies that are often non-trivial. Yet, refining the latent representation in generative SSL can effectively improve graph learning results. In this study, we propose HGVAE, a generative SSL method specially designed for HGL. Instead of focusing on designing complex strategies to capture heterogeneity, HGVAE centers on refining the latent representation. Specifically, HGVAE innovatively develops a contrastive task based on the latent representation. To ensure the hardness of negative samples, we develop a progressive negative sample generation (PNSG) mechanism that leverages the ability of Variational Inference (VI) to generate high-quality negative samples. As a pioneer in applying generative SSL for HGL, HGVAE refines the latent representation, thereby compelling the model to learn high-quality representations. Compared with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, HGVAE achieves impressive results, thus validating its superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maryam Haghighat, Peyman Moghadam, Shaheer Mohamed, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a powerful self-supervised strategy for visual pre-training without the use of labels. MIM applies random crops to input images, processes them with an encoder, and then recovers the masked inputs with a decoder, which encourages the network to capture and learn structural information about objects and scenes. The intermediate feature representations obtained from MIM are suitable for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose an Image Modeling framework based on random orthogonal projection instead of binary masking as in MIM. Our proposed Random Orthogonal Projection Image Modeling (ROPIM) reduces spatially-wise token information under guaranteed bound on the noise variance and can be considered as masking entire spatial image area under locally varying masking degrees. Since ROPIM uses a random subspace for the projection that realizes the masking step, the readily available complement of the subspace can be used during unmasking to promote recovery of removed information. In this paper, we show that using random orthogonal projection leads to superior performance compared to crop-based masking. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dai Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the depth degradation effect in residual connections, many efficient Vision Transformers models that rely on stacking layers for information exchange often fail to form sufficient information mixing, leading to unnatural visual perception. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose Aggregated Attention, a biomimetic design-based token mixer that simulates biological foveal vision and continuous eye movement while enabling each token on the feature map to have a global perception. Furthermore, we incorporate learnable tokens that interact with conventional queries and keys, which further diversifies the generation of affinity matrices beyond merely relying on the similarity between queries and keys. Our approach does not rely on stacking for information exchange, thus effectively avoiding depth degradation and achieving natural visual perception. Additionally, we propose Convolutional GLU, a channel mixer that bridges the gap between GLU and SE mechanism, which empowers each token to have channel attention based on its nearest neighbor image features, enhancing local modeling capability and model robustness. We combine aggregated attention and convolutional GLU to create a new visual backbone called TransNeXt. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TransNeXt achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple model sizes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwei Chen, Anxing Xiao, David Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the problem of long-horizon task planning with the Large Language Model (LLM) in an open-world household environment. Existing works fail to explicitly track key objects and attributes, leading to erroneous decisions in long-horizon tasks, or rely on highly engineered state features and feedback, which is not generalizable. We propose an open state representation that provides continuous expansion and updating of object attributes from the LLM's inherent capabilities for context understanding and historical action reasoning. Our proposed representation maintains a comprehensive record of an object's attributes and changes, enabling robust retrospective summary of the sequence of actions leading to the current state. This allows continuously updating world model to enhance context understanding for decision-making in task planning. We validate our model through experiments across simulated and real-world task planning scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods in a variety of tasks requiring long-horizon state tracking and reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qipan Xu, Youlong Ding, Xinxi Zhang, Jie Gao, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data privacy protection is garnering increased attention among researchers. Diffusion models (DMs), particularly with strict differential privacy, can potentially produce images with both high privacy and visual quality. However, challenges arise such as in ensuring robust protection in privatizing specific data attributes, areas where current models often fall short. To address these challenges, we introduce the PAC Privacy Preserving Diffusion Model, a model leverages diffusion principles and ensure Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) privacy. We enhance privacy protection by integrating a private classifier guidance into the Langevin Sampling Process. Additionally, recognizing the gap in measuring the privacy of models, we have developed a novel metric to gauge privacy levels. Our model, assessed with this new metric and supported by Gaussian matrix computations for the PAC bound, has shown superior performance in privacy protection over existing leading private generative models according to benchmark tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Li, Xiao Wang, Hongrui Liu, Chuan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies reveal the connection between GNNs and the diffusion process, which motivates many diffusion-based GNNs to be proposed. However, since these two mechanisms are closely related, one fundamental question naturally arises: Is there a general diffusion framework that can formally unify these GNNs? The answer to this question can not only deepen our understanding of the learning process of GNNs, but also may open a new door to design a broad new class of GNNs. In this paper, we propose a general diffusion equation framework with the fidelity term, which formally establishes the relationship between the diffusion process with more GNNs. Meanwhile, with this framework, we identify one characteristic of graph diffusion networks, i.e., the current neural diffusion process only corresponds to the first-order diffusion equation. However, by an experimental investigation, we show that the labels of high-order neighbors actually exhibit monophily property, which induces the similarity based on labels among high-order neighbors without requiring the similarity among first-order neighbors. This discovery motives to design a new high-order neighbor-aware diffusion equation, and derive a new type of graph diffusion network (HiD-Net) based on the framework. With the high-order diffusion equation, HiD-Net is more robust against attacks and works on both homophily and heterophily graphs. We not only theoretically analyze the relation between HiD-Net with high-order random walk, but also provide a theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive experimental results well demonstrate the effectiveness of HiD-Net over state-of-the-art graph diffusion networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Xu, Haosen Wang, Weigang Wang, Pengfei Zheng, Hongyang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have shown great potential in multiple research areas. Existing diffusion-based generative methods on de novo 3D molecule generation face two major challenges. Since majority heavy atoms in molecules allow connections to multiple atoms through single bonds, solely using pair-wise distance to model molecule geometries is insufficient. Therefore, the first one involves proposing an effective neural network as the denoising kernel that is capable to capture complex multi-body interatomic relationships and learn high-quality features. Due to the discrete nature of graphs, mainstream diffusion-based methods for molecules heavily rely on predefined rules and generate edges in an indirect manner. The second challenge involves accommodating molecule generation to diffusion and accurately predicting the existence of bonds. In our research, we view the iterative way of updating molecule conformations in diffusion process is consistent with molecular dynamics and introduce a novel molecule generation method named Geometric-Facilitated Molecular Diffusion (GFMDiff). For the first challenge, we introduce a Dual-Track Transformer Network (DTN) to fully excevate global spatial relationships and learn high quality representations which contribute to accurate predictions of features and geometries. As for the second challenge, we design Geometric-Facilitated Loss (GFLoss) which intervenes the formation of bonds during the training period, instead of directly embedding edges into the latent space. Comprehensive experiments on current benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GFMDiff.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Kaufman, Jean Costa, Everlyne Kimani</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in autonomous driving provide an opportunity for AI-assisted driving instruction that directly addresses the critical need for human driving improvement. How should an AI instructor convey information to promote learning? In a pre-post experiment (n = 41), we tested the impact of an AI Coach's explanatory communications modeled after performance driving expert instructions. Participants were divided into four (4) groups to assess two (2) dimensions of the AI coach's explanations: information type ('what' and 'why'-type explanations) and presentation modality (auditory and visual). We compare how different explanatory techniques impact driving performance, cognitive load, confidence, expertise, and trust via observational learning. Through interview, we delineate participant learning processes. Results show AI coaching can effectively teach performance driving skills to novices. We find the type and modality of information influences performance outcomes. Differences in how successfully participants learned are attributed to how information directs attention, mitigates uncertainty, and influences overload experienced by participants. Results suggest efficient, modality-appropriate explanations should be opted for when designing effective HMI communications that can instruct without overwhelming. Further, results support the need to align communications with human learning and cognitive processes. We provide eight design implications for future autonomous vehicle HMI and AI coach design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alastair Anderberg, James Bailey, Ricardo J. G. B. Campello, Michael E. Houle, Henrique O. Marques, Milo\v{s} Radovanovi\'c, Arthur Zimek</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric method for outlier detection that takes full account of local variations in intrinsic dimensionality within the dataset. Using the theory of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID), our 'dimensionality-aware' outlier detection method, DAO, is derived as an estimator of an asymptotic local expected density ratio involving the query point and a close neighbor drawn at random. The dimensionality-aware behavior of DAO is due to its use of local estimation of LID values in a theoretically-justified way. Through comprehensive experimentation on more than 800 synthetic and real datasets, we show that DAO significantly outperforms three popular and important benchmark outlier detection methods: Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Simplified LOF, and kNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianwei Ni, Benjamin Eysenbach, Erfan Seyedsalehi, Michel Ma, Clement Gehring, Aditya Mahajan, Pierre-Luc Bacon</p>
<p>Abstract: Representations are at the core of all deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods for both Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Many representation learning methods and theoretical frameworks have been developed to understand what constitutes an effective representation. However, the relationships between these methods and the shared properties among them remain unclear. In this paper, we show that many of these seemingly distinct methods and frameworks for state and history abstractions are, in fact, based on a common idea of self-predictive abstraction. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights into the widely adopted objectives and optimization, such as the stop-gradient technique, in learning self-predictive representations. These findings together yield a minimalist algorithm to learn self-predictive representations for states and histories. We validate our theories by applying our algorithm to standard MDPs, MDPs with distractors, and POMDPs with sparse rewards. These findings culminate in a set of preliminary guidelines for RL practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun-Peng Ning, Shuo Yang, Yu-Yang Liu, Jia-Yu Yao, Zhen-Hui Liu, Yu Wang, Ming Pang, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) evaluation methods typically focus on testing the performance on some closed-environment and domain-specific benchmarks with human annotations. In this paper, we explore a novel unsupervised evaluation direction, utilizing peer-review mechanisms to measure LLMs automatically. In this setting, both open-source and closed-source LLMs lie in the same environment, capable of answering unlabeled questions and evaluating each other, where each LLM's response score is jointly determined by other anonymous ones. To obtain the ability hierarchy among these models, we assign each LLM a learnable capability parameter to adjust the final ranking. We formalize it as a constrained optimization problem, intending to maximize the consistency of each LLM's capabilities and scores. The key assumption behind is that high-level LLM can evaluate others' answers more accurately than low-level ones, while higher-level LLM can also achieve higher response scores. Moreover, we propose three metrics called PEN, CIN, and LIS to evaluate the gap in aligning human rankings. We perform experiments on multiple datasets with these metrics, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploring the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in puzzle solving unveils critical insights into their potential and challenges in AI, marking a significant step towards understanding their applicability in complex reasoning tasks. This survey leverages a unique taxonomy -- dividing puzzles into rule-based and rule-less categories -- to critically assess LLMs through various methodologies, including prompting techniques, neuro-symbolic approaches, and fine-tuning. Through a critical review of relevant datasets and benchmarks, we assess LLMs' performance, identifying significant challenges in complex puzzle scenarios. Our findings highlight the disparity between LLM capabilities and human-like reasoning, particularly in those requiring advanced logical inference. The survey underscores the necessity for novel strategies and richer datasets to advance LLMs' puzzle-solving proficiency and contribute to AI's logical reasoning and creative problem-solving advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Till Beemelmanns, Quan Zhang, Christian Geller, Lutz Eckstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal 3D object detection models for automated driving have demonstrated exceptional performance on computer vision benchmarks like nuScenes. However, their reliance on densely sampled LiDAR point clouds and meticulously calibrated sensor arrays poses challenges for real-world applications. Issues such as sensor misalignment, miscalibration, and disparate sampling frequencies lead to spatial and temporal misalignment in data from LiDAR and cameras. Additionally, the integrity of LiDAR and camera data is often compromised by adverse environmental conditions such as inclement weather, leading to occlusions and noise interference. To address this challenge, we introduce MultiCorrupt, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of multi-modal 3D object detectors against ten distinct types of corruptions. We evaluate five state-of-the-art multi-modal detectors on MultiCorrupt and analyze their performance in terms of their resistance ability. Our results show that existing methods exhibit varying degrees of robustness depending on the type of corruption and their fusion strategy. We provide insights into which multi-modal design choices make such models robust against certain perturbations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengqing Jiang, Zhangchen Xu, Luyao Niu, Zhen Xiang, Bhaskar Ramasubramanian, Bo Li, Radha Poovendran</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety is critical to the usage of large language models (LLMs). Multiple techniques such as data filtering and supervised fine-tuning have been developed to strengthen LLM safety. However, currently known techniques presume that corpora used for safety alignment of LLMs are solely interpreted by semantics. This assumption, however, does not hold in real-world applications, which leads to severe vulnerabilities in LLMs. For example, users of forums often use ASCII art, a form of text-based art, to convey image information. In this paper, we propose a novel ASCII art-based jailbreak attack and introduce a comprehensive benchmark Vision-in-Text Challenge (ViTC) to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in recognizing prompts that cannot be solely interpreted by semantics. We show that five SOTA LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and Llama2) struggle to recognize prompts provided in the form of ASCII art. Based on this observation, we develop the jailbreak attack ArtPrompt, which leverages the poor performance of LLMs in recognizing ASCII art to bypass safety measures and elicit undesired behaviors from LLMs. ArtPrompt only requires black-box access to the victim LLMs, making it a practical attack. We evaluate ArtPrompt on five SOTA LLMs, and show that ArtPrompt can effectively and efficiently induce undesired behaviors from all five LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/ArtPrompt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadezhda Chirkova, Vassilina Nikoulina</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot cross-lingual knowledge transfer enables a multilingual pretrained language model, finetuned on a task in one language, make predictions for this task in other languages. While being broadly studied for natural language understanding tasks, the described setting is understudied for generation. Previous works notice a frequent problem of generation in a wrong language and propose approaches to address it, usually using mT5 as a backbone model. In this work we compare various approaches proposed from the literature in unified settings, also including alternative backbone models, namely mBART and NLLB-200. We first underline the importance of tuning learning rate used for finetuning, which helps to substantially alleviate the problem of generation in the wrong language. Then, we show that with careful learning rate tuning, the simple full finetuning of the model acts as a very strong baseline and alternative approaches bring only marginal improvements. Finally, we find that mBART performs similarly to mT5 of the same size, and NLLB-200 can be competitive in some cases. Our final zero-shot models reach the performance of the approach based on data translation which is usually considered as an upper baseline for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge editing aims at updating knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to prevent them from becoming outdated. Existing work edits LLMs at the level of factual knowledge triplets. However, natural knowledge updates in the real world come from the occurrences of new events rather than direct changes in factual triplets. In this paper, we propose a new task setting: event-level knowledge editing, which directly edits new events into LLMs and improves over conventional triplet-level editing on (1) Efficiency. A single event edit leads to updates in multiple entailed knowledge triplets. (2) Completeness. Beyond updating factual knowledge, event-level editing also requires considering the event influences and updating LLMs' knowledge about future trends. We construct a high-quality event-level editing benchmark ELKEN, consisting of 1,515 event edits, 6,449 questions about factual knowledge, and 10,150 questions about future tendencies. We systematically evaluate the performance of various knowledge editing methods and LLMs on this benchmark. We find that ELKEN poses significant challenges to existing knowledge editing approaches. Our codes and dataset are publicly released to facilitate further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning (IT) is widely used to teach pretrained large language models (LLMs) to follow arbitrary instructions, but is under-studied in multilingual settings. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in IT, when an LLM is instruction-tuned on English-only data and then tested on user prompts in other languages. We advocate for the importance of evaluating various aspects of model responses in multilingual instruction following and investigate the influence of different model configuration choices. We find that cross-lingual transfer does happen successfully in IT even if all stages of model training are English-centric, but only if multiliguality is taken into account in hyperparameter tuning and with large enough IT data. English-trained LLMs are capable of generating correct-language, comprehensive and helpful responses in other languages, but suffer from low factuality and may occasionally have fluency errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harshit Kumar, Biswadeep Chakraborty, Beomseok Kang, Saibal Mukhopadhyay</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the first systematic study of Deep Neural Network (DNN) evaluation under stochastic assumptions, focusing on wildfire prediction. We note that current evaluation strategies emphasize a DNN's replication of observed ground truths rather than its ability to learn the underlying stochastic processes, crucial for capturing wildfire evolution's complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel evaluation criterion: Has the DNN learned the stochastic process? Using a synthetic dataset, we introduce a framework to characterize the stochastic process (generated by randomness in fire evolution rules). Through this framework, we assess an evaluation metric's capability to test if the DNN has learned the stochastic process. Our findings show that conventional metrics, including classification-based metrics and proper scoring rules, are inadequate. We identify the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a robust metric that tests the proposed evaluation criteria, offering asymptotic guarantees of proper scoring rules and improved interpretability through calibration curves. We extend our analysis to real-world wildfire data, highlighting the limitations of traditional evaluation methods and demonstrating the utility of ECE as a stochasticity-compatible metric alongside existing ones.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models can generate high-quality humans, but realism is lost when generating hands. Common artifacts include irregular hand poses, shapes, incorrect numbers of fingers, and physically implausible finger orientations. To generate images with realistic hands, we propose a novel diffusion-based architecture called HanDiffuser that achieves realism by injecting hand embeddings in the generative process. HanDiffuser consists of two components: a Text-to-Hand-Params diffusion model to generate SMPL-Body and MANO-Hand parameters from input text prompts, and a Text-Guided Hand-Params-to-Image diffusion model to synthesize images by conditioning on the prompts and hand parameters generated by the previous component. We incorporate multiple aspects of hand representation, including 3D shapes and joint-level finger positions, orientations and articulations, for robust learning and reliable performance during inference. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and perform user studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating images with high-quality hands.</p>

To address this problem, a unified framework including the multi-pyramid transformer (MPT) and extended frequency contrastive regularization (EFCR) is proposed to tackle two outstanding challenges in microscopy deblur: longer attention span and data deficiency. The MPT employs an explicit pyramid structure at each network stage that integrates the cross-scale window attention (CSWA), the intra-scale channel attention (ISCA), and the feature-enhancing feed-forward network (FEFN) to capture long-range cross-scale spatial interaction and global channel context. The EFCR addresses the data deficiency problem by exploring latent deblur signals from different frequency bands. It also enables deblur knowledge transfer to learn cross-domain information from extra data, improving deblur performance for labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments and downstream task validation show the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. Project page: https://github.com/PieceZhang/MPT-CataBlur.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the use of large language model-based agents for interacting with software via web browsers. Unlike prior work, we focus on measuring the agents' ability to perform tasks that span the typical daily work of knowledge workers utilizing enterprise software systems. To this end, we propose WorkArena, a remote-hosted benchmark of 29 tasks based on the widely-used ServiceNow platform. We also introduce BrowserGym, an environment for the design and evaluation of such agents, offering a rich set of actions as well as multimodal observations. Our empirical evaluation reveals that while current agents show promise on WorkArena, there remains a considerable gap towards achieving full task automation. Notably, our analysis uncovers a significant performance disparity between open and closed-source LLMs, highlighting a critical area for future exploration and development in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Gupta, Dev Sajnani, Gopala Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a unifying framework that brings two leading "locate-and-edit" model editing techniques -- ROME and MEMIT -- under a single conceptual umbrella, optimizing for the same goal, which we call the preservation-memorization objective. ROME uses an equality constraint to perform one edit at a time, whereas MEMIT employs a more flexible least-square constraint that allows for batched edits. Following the preservation-memorization objective, we present Equality-constrained Mass Model Editing algorithm for Transformers or EMMET, a new batched memory-editing algorithm that uses a closed-form solution for the equality-constrained version of the preservation-memorization objective. EMMET is a batched-version of ROME and is able to perform batched-edits up to a batch-size of 10,000 with very similar performance to MEMIT across multiple dimensions. With EMMET, we unify and achieve symmetry within the "locate-and-edit" algorithms, allowing batched-editing using both objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timur Ibrayev, Amitangshu Mukherjee, Sai Aparna Aketi, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) based machine perception frameworks process the entire input in a one-shot manner to provide answers to both "what object is being observed" and "where it is located". In contrast, the "two-stream hypothesis" from neuroscience explains the neural processing in the human visual cortex as an active vision system that utilizes two separate regions of the brain to answer the what and the where questions. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework inspired by the "two-stream hypothesis" and explore the potential benefits that it offers. Specifically, the proposed framework models the following mechanisms: 1) ventral (what) stream focusing on the input regions perceived by the fovea part of an eye (foveation), 2) dorsal (where) stream providing visual guidance, and 3) iterative processing of the two streams to calibrate visual focus and process the sequence of focused image patches. The training of the proposed framework is accomplished by label-based DNN training for the ventral stream model and reinforcement learning for the dorsal stream model. We show that the two-stream foveation-based learning is applicable to the challenging task of weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL), where the training data is limited to the object class or its attributes. The framework is capable of both predicting the properties of an object and successfully localizing it by predicting its bounding box. We also show that, due to the independent nature of the two streams, the dorsal model can be applied on its own to unseen images to localize objects from different datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayue Zhang, Yiheng Liu, Wenqi Cai, Lanlan Wu, Yali Peng, Jingjing Yu, Senqing Qi, Taotao Long, Bao Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic. This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers. Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing". The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test. However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test. Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity. However, its strengths on promoting students. knowledge application and creativity were insignificant. Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses. Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach. The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce VoiceCraft, a token infilling neural codec language model, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) on audiobooks, internet videos, and podcasts. VoiceCraft employs a Transformer decoder architecture and introduces a token rearrangement procedure that combines causal masking and delayed stacking to enable generation within an existing sequence. On speech editing tasks, VoiceCraft produces edited speech that is nearly indistinguishable from unedited recordings in terms of naturalness, as evaluated by humans; for zero-shot TTS, our model outperforms prior SotA models including VALLE and the popular commercial model XTTS-v2. Crucially, the models are evaluated on challenging and realistic datasets, that consist of diverse accents, speaking styles, recording conditions, and background noise and music, and our model performs consistently well compared to other models and real recordings. In particular, for speech editing evaluation, we introduce a high quality, challenging, and realistic dataset named RealEdit.

<p>Abstract: We present a generic Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework optimized for crafting adversarial attacks on different model types spanning from ECG signal analysis (1D), image classification (2D), and video classification (3D). The framework focuses on identifying sensitive regions and inducing misclassifications with minimal distortions and various distortion types. The novel RL method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for all three applications, proving its efficiency. Our RL approach produces superior localization masks, enhancing interpretability for image classification and ECG analysis models. For applications such as ECG analysis, our platform highlights critical ECG segments for clinicians while ensuring resilience against prevalent distortions. This comprehensive tool aims to bolster both resilience with adversarial training and transparency across varied applications and data types.</p>

<p>Abstract: Individuality and personalization comprise the distinctive characteristics that make each writer unique and influence their words in order to effectively engage readers while conveying authenticity. However, our growing reliance on LLM-based writing assistants risks compromising our creativity and individuality over time. We often overlook the negative impacts of this trend on our creativity and uniqueness, despite the possible consequences. This study investigates these concerns by performing a brief survey to explore different perspectives and concepts, as well as trying to understand people's viewpoints, in conjunction with past studies in the area. Addressing these issues is essential for improving human-computer interaction systems and enhancing writing assistants for personalization and individuality.</p>

However, using writing assistants introduces a mental dilemma, as some content isn't directly our creation. For instance, we tend to credit Large Language Models (LLMs) more in creative tasks, even though all tasks are equal for them.

<p>Abstract: Because of its use in practice, open-world object detection (OWOD) has gotten a lot of attention recently. The challenge is how can a model detect novel classes and then incrementally learn them without forgetting previously known classes. Previous approaches hinge on strongly-supervised or weakly-supervised novel-class data for novel-class detection, which may not apply to real applications. We construct a new benchmark that novel classes are only encountered at the inference stage. And we propose a new OWOD detector YOLOOC, based on the YOLO architecture yet for the Open-Class setup. We introduce label smoothing to prevent the detector from over-confidently mapping novel classes to known classes and to discover novel classes. Extensive experiments conducted on our more realistic setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for discovering novel classes in our new benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houssem Ben Braiek, Foutse Khomh</p>
<p>Abstract: This chapter explores the foundational concept of robustness in Machine Learning (ML) and its integral role in establishing trustworthiness in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. The discussion begins with a detailed definition of robustness, portraying it as the ability of ML models to maintain stable performance across varied and unexpected environmental conditions. ML robustness is dissected through several lenses: its complementarity with generalizability; its status as a requirement for trustworthy AI; its adversarial vs non-adversarial aspects; its quantitative metrics; and its indicators such as reproducibility and explainability. The chapter delves into the factors that impede robustness, such as data bias, model complexity, and the pitfalls of underspecified ML pipelines. It surveys key techniques for robustness assessment from a broad perspective, including adversarial attacks, encompassing both digital and physical realms. It covers non-adversarial data shifts and nuances of Deep Learning (DL) software testing methodologies. The discussion progresses to explore amelioration strategies for bolstering robustness, starting with data-centric approaches like debiasing and augmentation. Further examination includes a variety of model-centric methods such as transfer learning, adversarial training, and randomized smoothing. Lastly, post-training methods are discussed, including ensemble techniques, pruning, and model repairs, emerging as cost-effective strategies to make models more resilient against the unpredictable. This chapter underscores the ongoing challenges and limitations in estimating and achieving ML robustness by existing approaches. It offers insights and directions for future research on this crucial concept, as a prerequisite for trustworthy AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level optimal control problem. On the local level node controllers perform intrusion recovery, and on the global level a system controller manages the replication factor. The local and global control problems can be formulated as classical problems in operations research, namely, the machine replacement problem and the inventory replenishment problem. Based on this formulation, we design TOLERANCE, a novel control architecture for intrusion-tolerant systems. We prove that the optimal control strategies on both levels have threshold structure and design efficient algorithms for computing them. We implement and evaluate TOLERANCE in an emulation environment where we run 10 types of network intrusions. The results show that TOLERANCE can improve service availability and reduce operational cost compared with state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xusen Guo (Frank), Qiming Zhang (Frank), Junyue Jiang (Frank), Mingxing Peng (Frank),  Hao (Frank),  Yang, Meixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. It has experienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in capturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning architectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive understanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving both accuracy and responsibility in traffic prediction models remains a challenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Responsible and Reliable Traffic flow forecasting model with Large Language Models (R2T-LLM), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate responsible traffic predictions. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, R2T-LLM captures complex spatial-temporal patterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM framework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, R2T-LLM shows competitive accuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing an intuitive and reliable explanation for predictions. We discuss the spatial-temporal and input dependencies for conditional future flow forecasting, showcasing R2T-LLM's potential for diverse city prediction tasks. This paper contributes to advancing accountable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use LLM for accountable and reliable prediction of traffic flows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunxiao Li, Charlie Liu, Jonathan Chung, Zhengyang Lu, Piyush Jha, Vijay Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Restart policy is an important technique used in modern Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers, wherein some parts of the solver state are erased at certain intervals during the run of the solver. In most solvers, variable activities are preserved across restart boundaries, resulting in solvers continuing to search parts of the assignment tree that are not far from the one immediately prior to a restart. To enable the solver to search possibly "distant" parts of the assignment tree, we study the effect of resets, a variant of restarts which not only erases the assignment trail, but also randomizes the activity scores of the variables of the input formula after reset, thus potentially enabling a better global exploration of the search space.
  In this paper, we model the problem of whether to trigger reset as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose two reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive reset policies using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson sampling algorithms. These two algorithms balance the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by adaptively choosing arms (reset vs. no reset) based on their estimated rewards during the solver's run. We implement our reset policies in four baseline SOTA CDCL solvers and compare the baselines against the reset versions on Satcoin benchmarks and SAT Competition instances. Our results show that RL-based reset versions outperform the corresponding baseline solvers on both Satcoin and the SAT competition instances, suggesting that our RL policy helps to dynamically and profitably adapt the reset frequency for any given input instance. We also introduce the concept of a partial reset, where at least a constant number of variable activities are retained across reset boundaries. Building on previous results, we show that there is an exponential separation between O(1) vs. $\Omega(n)$-length partial resets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songhui Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: While AI is extensively transforming Software Engineering (SE) fields, SE is still in need of a framework to overall consider all phases to facilitate Automated Software Evolution (ASEv), particularly for intelligent applications that are context-rich, instead of conquering each division independently. Its complexity comes from the intricacy of the intelligent applications, the heterogeneity of the data sources, and the constant changes in the context. This study proposes a conceptual framework for achieving automated software evolution, emphasizing the importance of multimodality learning. A Selective Sequential Scope Model (3S) model is developed based on the conceptual framework, and it can be used to categorize existing and future research when it covers different SE phases and multimodal learning tasks. This research is a preliminary step toward the blueprint of a higher-level ASEv. The proposed conceptual framework can act as a practical guideline for practitioners to prepare themselves for diving into this area. Although the study is about intelligent applications, the framework and analysis methods may be adapted for other types of software as AI brings more intelligence into their life cycles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prior research on deep video compression (DVC) for machine tasks typically necessitates training a unique codec for each specific task, mandating a dedicated decoder per task. In contrast, traditional video codecs employ a flexible encoder controller, enabling the adaptation of a single codec to different tasks through mechanisms like mode prediction. Drawing inspiration from this, we introduce an innovative encoder controller for deep video compression for machines. This controller features a mode prediction and a Group of Pictures (GoP) selection module. Our approach centralizes control at the encoding stage, allowing for adaptable encoder adjustments across different tasks, such as detection and tracking, while maintaining compatibility with a standard pre-trained DVC decoder. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our method is applicable across multiple tasks with various existing pre-trained DVCs. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous DVC by about 25% bitrate for different tasks, with only one pre-trained decoder.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a method to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating structured content adhering to specific conventions without fine-tuning. By utilizing coroutine-based content generation constraints through a pre-agreed context-free grammar (CFG), LLMs are directed during decoding to produce formal language compliant outputs. This enhances stability and consistency in generating target data structures, types, or instructions, reducing application development complexities. Experimentally, error rates of GPT-2 and Gemma exceed 95% for DSLs longer than 36 and 282 tokens, respectively. We introduce YieldLang, a coroutine-based DSL generation framework, and evaluate it with LLMs on various tasks including JSON and Mermaid flowchart generation. Compared to benchmarks, our approach improves accuracy by 1.09 to 11.6 times, with LLMs requiring only about 16.5% of the samples to generate JSON effectively. This enhances usability of LLM-generated content for computer programs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahidur Rahoman Sohag, Sai Zhang, Min Xian, Shoukun Sun, Fei Xu, Zhegang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Industry-wide nuclear power plant operating experience is a critical source of raw data for performing parameter estimations in reliability and risk models. Much operating experience information pertains to failure events and is stored as reports containing unstructured data, such as narratives. Event reports are essential for understanding how failures are initiated and propagated, including the numerous causal relations involved. Causal relation extraction using deep learning represents a significant frontier in the field of natural language processing (NLP), and is crucial since it enables the interpretation of intricate narratives and connections contained within vast amounts of written information. This paper proposed a hybrid framework for causality detection and extraction from nuclear licensee event reports. The main contributions include: (1) we compiled an LER corpus with 20,129 text samples for causality analysis, (2) developed an interactive tool for labeling cause effect pairs, (3) built a deep-learning-based approach for causal relation detection, and (4) developed a knowledge based cause-effect extraction approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale high-quality training data is important for improving the performance of models. After trained with data that has rationales (reasoning steps), models gain reasoning capability. However, the dataset with high-quality rationales is relatively scarce due to the high annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose \textit{Self-motivated Learning} framework. The framework motivates the model itself to automatically generate rationales on existing datasets. Based on the inherent rank from correctness across multiple rationales, the model learns to generate better rationales, leading to higher reasoning capability. Specifically, we train a reward model with the rank to evaluate the quality of rationales, and improve the performance of reasoning through reinforcement learning. Experiment results of Llama2 7B on multiple reasoning datasets show that our method significantly improves the reasoning ability of models, even outperforming text-davinci-002 in some datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores object detection in historical aerial photographs of Namibia to identify long-term environmental changes. Specifically, we aim to identify key objects -- Waterholes, Omuti homesteads, and Big trees -- around Oshikango in Namibia using sub-meter gray-scale aerial imagery from 1943 and 1972. In this work, we propose a workflow for analyzing historical aerial imagery using a deep semantic segmentation model on sparse hand-labels. To this end, we employ a number of strategies including class-weighting, pseudo-labeling and empirical p-value-based filtering to balance skewed and sparse representations of objects in the ground truth data. Results demonstrate the benefits of these different training strategies resulting in an average $F_1=0.661$ and $F_1=0.755$ over the three objects of interest for the 1943 and 1972 imagery, respectively. We also identified that the average size of Waterhole and Big trees increased while the average size of Omuti homesteads decreased between 1943 and 1972 reflecting some of the local effects of the massive post-Second World War economic, agricultural, demographic, and environmental changes. This work also highlights the untapped potential of historical aerial photographs in understanding long-term environmental changes beyond Namibia (and Africa). With the lack of adequate satellite technology in the past, archival aerial photography offers a great alternative to uncover decades-long environmental changes.</p>

By indexing knowledge through vectorization, a variety of knowledge retrieval methods have emerged, significantly enhancing the efficacy of knowledge management systems. Recently, the rapid advancements in generative natural language processing technologies paved the way for generating precise and coherent answers after retrieving relevant documents tailored to user queries. However, for enterprise knowledge bases, assembling extensive training data from scratch for knowledge retrieval and generation is a formidable challenge due to the privacy and security policies of private data, frequently entailing substantial costs. To address the challenge above, in this paper, we propose EKRG, a novel Retrieval-Generation framework based on large language models (LLMs), expertly designed to enable question-answering for Enterprise Knowledge bases with limited annotation costs. Specifically, for the retrieval process, we first introduce an instruction-tuning method using an LLM to generate sufficient document-question pairs for training a knowledge retriever. This method, through carefully designed instructions, efficiently generates diverse questions for enterprise knowledge bases, encompassing both fact-oriented and solution-oriented knowledge. Additionally, we develop a relevance-aware teacher-student learning strategy to further enhance the efficiency of the training process. For the generation process, we propose a novel chain of thought (CoT) based fine-tuning method to empower the LLM-based generator to adeptly respond to user questions using retrieved documents. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Agiza, Mohamed Mostagir, Sherief Reda</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era where language models are increasingly integrated into decision-making and communication, understanding the biases within Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes imperative, especially when these models are applied in the economic and political domains. This work investigates the impact of fine-tuning and data selection on economic and political biases in LLM. We explore the methodological aspects of biasing LLMs towards specific ideologies, mindful of the biases that arise from their extensive training on diverse datasets. Our approach, distinct from earlier efforts that either focus on smaller models or entail resource-intensive pre-training, employs Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques. These techniques allow for the alignment of LLMs with targeted ideologies by modifying a small subset of parameters. We introduce a systematic method for dataset selection, annotation, and instruction tuning, and we assess its effectiveness through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work analyzes the potential of embedding specific biases into LLMs and contributes to the dialogue on the ethical application of AI, highlighting the importance of deploying AI in a manner that aligns with societal values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhao Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: The Gaussian splatting methods are getting popular. However, their loss function only contains the $\ell_1$ norm and the structural similarity between the rendered and input images, without considering the edges in these images. It is well-known that the edges in an image provide important information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Edge Guided Gaussian Splatting (EGGS) method that leverages the edges in the input images. More specifically, we give the edge region a higher weight than the flat region. With such edge guidance, the resulting Gaussian particles focus more on the edges instead of the flat regions. Moreover, such edge guidance does not crease the computation cost during the training and rendering stage. The experiments confirm that such simple edge-weighted loss function indeed improves about $1\sim2$ dB on several difference data sets. With simply plugging in the edge guidance, the proposed method can improve all Gaussian splatting methods in different scenarios, such as human head modeling, building 3D reconstruction, etc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tal Hakim</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of machine-learning solutions to movement assessment from skeleton videos has attracted significant research attention in recent years. This advancement has made rehabilitation at home more accessible, utilizing movement assessment algorithms that can operate on affordable equipment for human pose detection and analysis from 2D or 3D videos. While the primary objective of automatic assessment tasks is to score movements, the automatic generation of feedback highlighting key movement issues has the potential to significantly enhance and accelerate the rehabilitation process. While numerous research works exist in the field of automatic movement assessment, only a handful address feedback generation. In this study, we explain the types of feedback that can be generated, review existing solutions for automatic feedback generation, and discuss future research directions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of feedback generation in skeletal movement assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihan Wang, Lujun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Obtaining reliable precipitation estimation with high resolutions in time and space is of great importance to hydrological studies. However, accurately estimating precipitation is a challenging task over high mountainous complex terrain. The three widely used precipitation measurement approaches, namely rainfall gauge, precipitation radars, and satellite-based precipitation sensors, have their own pros and cons in producing reliable precipitation products over complex areas. One way to decrease the detection error probability and improve data reliability is precipitation data merging. With the rapid advancements in computational capabilities and the escalating volume and diversity of earth observational data, Deep Learning (DL) models have gained considerable attention in geoscience. In this study, a deep learning technique, namely Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), was employed to merge a radar-based and a satellite-based Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation product Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation product at hourly scale. The merged results are compared with the widely used reanalysis precipitation product, Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS), and assessed against gauge observational data from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC). The findings indicated that the LSTM-based merged precipitation notably underestimated gauge observations and, at times, failed to provide meaningful estimates, showing predominantly near-zero values. Relying solely on individual Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPEs) without additional meteorological input proved insufficient for generating reliable merged QPE. However, the merged results effectively captured the temporal trends of the observations, outperforming MRMS in this aspect. This suggested that incorporating bias correction techniques could potentially enhance the accuracy of the merged product.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Jiang, Zixin Guo, Hamed Rezazadegan Tavakoli, Luis A. Leiva, Antti Oulasvirta</p>
<p>Abstract: From a visual perception perspective, modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) comprise a complex graphics-rich two-dimensional visuospatial arrangement of text, images, and interactive objects such as buttons and menus. While existing models can accurately predict regions and objects that are likely to attract attention ``on average'', so far there is no scanpath model capable of predicting scanpaths for an individual. To close this gap, we introduce EyeFormer, which leverages a Transformer architecture as a policy network to guide a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that controls gaze locations. Our model has the unique capability of producing personalized predictions when given a few user scanpath samples. It can predict full scanpath information, including fixation positions and duration, across individuals and various stimulus types. Additionally, we demonstrate applications in GUI layout optimization driven by our model. Our software and models will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huihan Li, Liwei Jiang, Nouha Dziri, Xiang Ren, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: As the utilization of large language models (LLMs) has proliferated worldwide, it is crucial for them to have adequate knowledge and fair representation for diverse global cultures. In this work, we uncover culture perceptions of three SOTA models on 110 countries and regions on 8 culture-related topics through culture-conditioned generations, and extract symbols from these generations that are associated to each culture by the LLM. We discover that culture-conditioned generation consist of linguistic "markers" that distinguish marginalized cultures apart from default cultures. We also discover that LLMs have an uneven degree of diversity in the culture symbols, and that cultures from different geographic regions have different presence in LLMs' culture-agnostic generation. Our findings promote further research in studying the knowledge and fairness of global culture perception in LLMs. Code and Data can be found in: https://github.com/huihanlhh/Culture-Gen/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanwook Park, Sourav Saha, Jiachen Guo, Xiaoyu Xie, Satyajit Mojumder, Miguel A. Bessa, Dong Qian, Wei Chen, Gregory J. Wagner, Jian Cao, Wing Kam Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network theories has revolutionized the way software is programmed, shifting from a hard-coded series of codes to a vast neural network. However, this transition in engineering software has faced challenges such as data scarcity, multi-modality of data, low model accuracy, and slow inference. Here, we propose a new network based on interpolation theories and tensor decomposition, the interpolating neural network (INN). Instead of interpolating training data, a common notion in computer science, INN interpolates interpolation points in the physical space whose coordinates and values are trainable. It can also extrapolate if the interpolation points reside outside of the range of training data and the interpolation functions have a larger support domain. INN features orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters, faster training, a smaller memory footprint, and higher model accuracy compared to feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) or physics-informed neural networks (PINN). INN is poised to usher in Engineering Software 2.0, a unified neural network that spans various domains of space, time, parameters, and initial/boundary conditions. This has previously been computationally prohibitive due to the exponentially growing number of trainable parameters, easily exceeding the parameter size of ChatGPT, which is over 1 trillion. INN addresses this challenge by leveraging tensor decomposition and tensor product, with adaptable network architecture.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present two novel methods in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The first approach, Scattering Transform with E-GraphSAGE (STEG), utilizes the scattering transform to conduct multi-resolution analysis of edge feature vectors. This provides a detailed representation that is essential for identifying subtle anomalies in network traffic. The second approach improves node representation by initiating with Node2Vec, diverging from standard methods of using uniform values, thereby capturing a more accurate and holistic network picture. Our methods have shown significant improvements in performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in benchmark NIDS datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Duan, Jie Lu, Junyu Xuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) necessitates seamless collaboration among agents, often represented by an underlying relation graph. Existing methods for learning this graph primarily focus on agent-pair relations, neglecting higher-order relationships. While several approaches attempt to extend cooperation modelling to encompass behaviour similarities within groups, they commonly fall short in concurrently learning the latent graph, thereby constraining the information exchange among partially observed agents. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel approach to infer the Group-Aware Coordination Graph (GACG), which is designed to capture both the cooperation between agent pairs based on current observations and group-level dependencies from behaviour patterns observed across trajectories. This graph is further used in graph convolution for information exchange between agents during decision-making. To further ensure behavioural consistency among agents within the same group, we introduce a group distance loss, which promotes group cohesion and encourages specialization between groups. Our evaluations, conducted on StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, demonstrate GACG's superior performance. An ablation study further provides experimental evidence of the effectiveness of each component of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Xu, Zhaorui Zhang, Sheng Di, Benben Liu, Khalid Ayed Alharthi, Jiannong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning has been identified as an efficient decentralized training paradigm for scaling the machine learning model training on a large number of devices while guaranteeing the data privacy of the trainers. FedAvg has become a foundational parameter update strategy for federated learning, which has been promising to eliminate the effect of the heterogeneous data across clients and guarantee convergence. However, the synchronization parameter update barriers for each communication round during the training significant time on waiting, slowing down the training procedure. Therefore, recent state-of-the-art solutions propose using semi-asynchronous approaches to mitigate the waiting time cost with guaranteed convergence. Nevertheless, emerging semi-asynchronous approaches are unable to eliminate the waiting time completely.
  We propose a full asynchronous training paradigm, called FedFa, which can guarantee model convergence and eliminate the waiting time completely for federated learning by using a few buffered results on the server for parameter updating. Further, we provide theoretical proof of the convergence rate for our proposed FedFa. Extensive experimental results indicate our approach effectively improves the training performance of federated learning by up to 6x and 4x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art synchronous and semi-asynchronous strategies while retaining high accuracy in both IID and Non-IID scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lujain Ibrahim, Luc Rocher, Ana Valdivia</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of applications using artificial intelligence (AI) systems has led to a growing number of users interacting with these systems through sophisticated interfaces. Human-computer interaction research has long shown that interfaces shape both user behavior and user perception of technical capabilities and risks. Yet, practitioners and researchers evaluating the social and ethical risks of AI systems tend to overlook the impact of anthropomorphic, deceptive, and immersive interfaces on human-AI interactions. Here, we argue that design features of interfaces with adaptive AI systems can have cascading impacts, driven by feedback loops, which extend beyond those previously considered. We first conduct a scoping review of AI interface designs and their negative impact to extract salient themes of potentially harmful design patterns in AI interfaces. Then, we propose Design-Enhanced Control of AI systems (DECAI), a conceptual model to structure and facilitate impact assessments of AI interface designs. DECAI draws on principles from control systems theory -- a theory for the analysis and design of dynamic physical systems -- to dissect the role of the interface in human-AI systems. Through two case studies on recommendation systems and conversational language model systems, we show how DECAI can be used to evaluate AI interface designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojian Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate wind speed series forecast is very pivotal to security of grid dispatching and the application of wind power. Nevertheless, on account of their nonlinear and non-stationary nature, their short-term forecast is extremely challenging. Therefore, this dissertation raises one short-term wind speed forecast pattern on the foundation of attention with an improved gated recurrent neural network (AtGRU) and a tactic of error correction. That model uses the AtGRU model as the preliminary predictor and the GRU model as the error corrector. At the beginning, SSA (singular spectrum analysis) is employed in previous wind speed series for lessening the noise. Subsequently, historical wind speed series is going to be used for the predictor training. During this process, the prediction can have certain errors. The sequence of these errors processed by variational modal decomposition (VMD) is used to train the corrector of error. The eventual forecast consequence is just the sum of predictor forecast and error corrector. The proposed SSA-AtGRU-VMD-GRU model outperforms the compared models in three case studies on Woodburn, St. Thomas, and Santa Cruz. It is indicated that the model evidently enhances the correction of the wind speed forecast.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose M. Munoz, Silviu M. Udrescu, Ronald F. Garcia Ruiz</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous phenomenological nuclear models have been proposed to describe specific observables within different regions of the nuclear chart. However, developing a unified model that describes the complex behavior of all nuclei remains an open challenge. Here, we explore whether novel symbolic Machine Learning (ML) can rediscover traditional nuclear physics models or identify alternatives with improved simplicity, fidelity, and predictive power. To address this challenge, we developed a Multi-objective Iterated Symbolic Regression approach that handles symbolic regressions over multiple target observables, accounts for experimental uncertainties and is robust against high-dimensional problems. As a proof of principle, we applied this method to describe the nuclear binding energies and charge radii of light and medium mass nuclei. Our approach identified simple analytical relationships based on the number of protons and neutrons, providing interpretable models with precision comparable to state-of-the-art nuclear models. Additionally, we integrated this ML-discovered model with an existing complementary model to estimate the limits of nuclear stability. These results highlight the potential of symbolic ML to develop accurate nuclear models and guide our description of complex many-body problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Graham Todd, Tim Merino, Sam Earle, Julian Togelius</p>
<p>Abstract: The Connections puzzle published each day by the New York Times tasks players with dividing a bank of sixteen words into four groups of four words that each relate to a common theme. Solving the puzzle requires both common linguistic knowledge (i.e. definitions and typical usage) as well as, in many cases, lateral or abstract thinking. This is because the four categories ascend in complexity, with the most challenging category often requiring thinking about words in uncommon ways or as parts of larger phrases. We investigate the capacity for automated AI systems to play Connections and explore the game's potential as an automated benchmark for abstract reasoning and a way to measure the semantic information encoded by data-driven linguistic systems. In particular, we study both a sentence-embedding baseline and modern large language models (LLMs). We report their accuracy on the task, measure the impacts of chain-of-thought prompting, and discuss their failure modes. Overall, we find that the Connections task is challenging yet feasible, and a strong test-bed for future work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unleashing the synergies of rapidly evolving mobility technologies in a multi-stakeholder landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing urban transportation problems. This paper introduces a novel synthetic participatory method, critically leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create digital avatars representing diverse stakeholders to plan shared automated electric mobility systems (SAEMS). These calibratable agents collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with high controllability and comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than generated using a single LLM-enabled expert agent. Consequently, the approach provides a promising avenue for cost-efficiently improving the inclusivity and interpretability of multi-objective transportation planning, suggesting a paradigm shift in how we envision and strategize for sustainable and equitable transportation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Liang, Haotian Liu, Hongteng Xu, Dixin Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: As a significant step for human face modeling, editing, and generation, face landmarking aims at extracting facial keypoints from images. A generalizable face landmarker is required in practice because real-world facial images, e.g., the avatars in animations and games, are often stylized in various ways. However, achieving generalizable face landmarking is challenging due to the diversity of facial styles and the scarcity of labeled stylized faces. In this study, we propose a simple but effective paradigm to learn a generalizable face landmarker based on labeled real human faces and unlabeled stylized faces. Our method learns the face landmarker as the key module of a conditional face warper. Given a pair of real and stylized facial images, the conditional face warper predicts a warping field from the real face to the stylized one, in which the face landmarker predicts the ending points of the warping field and provides us with high-quality pseudo landmarks for the corresponding stylized facial images. Applying an alternating optimization strategy, we learn the face landmarker to minimize $i)$ the discrepancy between the stylized faces and the warped real ones and $ii)$ the prediction errors of both real and pseudo landmarks. Experiments on various datasets show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods in face landmarking tasks, leading to a face landmarker with better generalizability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiang Shi, Rujie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion generative modelling (DGM) based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with score matching has achieved unprecedented results in data generation. In this paper, we propose a novel fast high-quality generative modelling method based on high-order Langevin dynamics (HOLD) with score matching. This motive is proved by third-order Langevin dynamics. By augmenting the previous SDEs, e.g. variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs for single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously model position, velocity, and acceleration, thereby improving the quality and speed of the data generation at the same time. HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and two Hamiltonians, which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude. Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the public data set CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in both Frechet inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood, and achieves the state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.</p>
