<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05522">Continuous Thought Machines</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Darlow, Ciaran Regan, Sebastian Risi, Jeffrey Seely, Llion Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological brains demonstrate complex neural activity, where the timing and interplay between neurons is critical to how brains process information. Most deep learning architectures simplify neural activity by abstracting away temporal dynamics. In this paper we challenge that paradigm. By incorporating neuron-level processing and synchronization, we can effectively reintroduce neural timing as a foundational element. We present the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), a model designed to leverage neural dynamics as its core representation. The CTM has two core innovations: (1) neuron-level temporal processing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process a history of incoming signals; and (2) neural synchronization employed as a latent representation. The CTM aims to strike a balance between oversimplified neuron abstractions that improve computational efficiency, and biological realism. It operates at a level of abstraction that effectively captures essential temporal dynamics while remaining computationally tractable for deep learning. We demonstrate the CTM's strong performance and versatility across a range of challenging tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, solving 2D mazes, sorting, parity computation, question-answering, and RL tasks. Beyond displaying rich internal representations and offering a natural avenue for interpretation owing to its internal process, the CTM is able to perform tasks that require complex sequential reasoning. The CTM can also leverage adaptive compute, where it can stop earlier for simpler tasks, or keep computing when faced with more challenging instances. The goal of this work is to share the CTM and its associated innovations, rather than pushing for new state-of-the-art results. To that end, we believe the CTM represents a significant step toward developing more biologically plausible and powerful artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05525">A critical assessment of reinforcement learning methods for microswimmer navigation in complex flows</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Selim Mecanna, Aurore Loisy, Christophe Eloy</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigating in a fluid flow while being carried by it, using only information accessible from on-board sensors, is a problem commonly faced by small planktonic organisms. It is also directly relevant to autonomous robots deployed in the oceans. In the last ten years, the fluid mechanics community has widely adopted reinforcement learning, often in the form of its simplest implementations, to address this challenge. But it is unclear how good are the strategies learned by these algorithms. In this paper, we perform a quantitative assessment of reinforcement learning methods applied to navigation in partially observable flows. We first introduce a well-posed problem of directional navigation for which a quasi-optimal policy is known analytically. We then report on the poor performance and robustness of commonly used algorithms (Q-Learning, Advantage Actor Critic) in flows regularly encountered in the literature: Taylor-Green vortices, Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, and two-dimensional turbulence. We show that they are vastly surpassed by PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), a more advanced algorithm that has established dominance across a wide range of benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community. In particular, our custom implementation of PPO matches the theoretical quasi-optimal performance in turbulent flow and does so in a robust manner. Reaching this result required the use of several additional techniques, such as vectorized environments and generalized advantage estimation, as well as hyperparameter optimization. This study demonstrates the importance of algorithm selection, implementation details, and fine-tuning for discovering truly smart autonomous navigation strategies in complex flows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Perin, Cesare Bidini, Riccardo Mazzieri, Michele Rossi</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, it suffers from low scalability and numerical imprecision. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step function's non-differentiability. We formulate the problem, derive closed-form updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence properties, great potential, and possible new research directions to improve the method in a simulated proof-of-concept.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Liu, Qian Zheng, Kaiwen Tao, Zhiteng Li, Haotong Qin, Wenbo Li, Yong Guo, Xianglong Liu, Linghe Kong, Guihai Chen, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With unprecedented rapid development, deep neural networks (DNNs) have deeply influenced almost all fields. However, their heavy computation costs and model sizes are usually unacceptable in real-world deployment. Model quantization, an effective weight-lighting technique, has become an indispensable procedure in the whole deployment pipeline. The essence of quantization acceleration is the conversion from continuous floating-point numbers to discrete integer ones, which significantly speeds up the memory I/O and calculation, i.e., addition and multiplication. However, performance degradation also comes with the conversion because of the loss of precision. Therefore, it has become increasingly popular and critical to investigate how to perform the conversion and how to compensate for the information loss. This article surveys the recent five-year progress towards low-bit quantization on DNNs. We discuss and compare the state-of-the-art quantization methods and classify them into 8 main categories and 24 sub-categories according to their core techniques. Furthermore, we shed light on the potential research opportunities in the field of model quantization. A curated list of model quantization is provided at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/Awesome-Model-Quantization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05533">Rethinking Graph Contrastive Learning through Relative Similarity Preservation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Ning, Pengfei Wang, Ziyue Qiao, Pengyang Wang, Yuanchun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has achieved remarkable success by following the computer vision paradigm of preserving absolute similarity between augmented views. However, this approach faces fundamental challenges in graphs due to their discrete, non-Euclidean nature -- view generation often breaks semantic validity and similarity verification becomes unreliable. Through analyzing 11 real-world graphs, we discover a universal pattern transcending the homophily-heterophily dichotomy: label consistency systematically diminishes as structural distance increases, manifesting as smooth decay in homophily graphs and oscillatory decay in heterophily graphs. We establish theoretical guarantees for this pattern through random walk theory, proving label distribution convergence and characterizing the mechanisms behind different decay behaviors. This discovery reveals that graphs naturally encode relative similarity patterns, where structurally closer nodes exhibit collectively stronger semantic relationships. Leveraging this insight, we propose RELGCL, a novel GCL framework with complementary pairwise and listwise implementations that preserve these inherent patterns through collective similarity objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 20 existing approaches across both homophily and heterophily graphs, validating the effectiveness of leveraging natural relative similarity over artificial absolute similarity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Kamrujjaman Mobin, Md Saiful Islam, Sadik Al Barid, Md Masum</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification is crucial for automated cardiac disease diagnosis, yet existing methods often struggle to capture local morphological details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose Cardioformer, a novel multi-granularity hybrid model that integrates cross-channel patching, hierarchical residual learning, and a two-stage self-attention mechanism. Cardioformer first encodes multi-scale token embeddings to capture fine-grained local features and global contextual information and then selectively fuses these representations through intra- and inter-granularity self-attention. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark ECG datasets under subject-independent settings demonstrate that model consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines. Our Cardioformer model achieves the AUROC of 96.34$\pm$0.11, 89.99$\pm$0.12, and 95.59$\pm$1.66 in MIMIC-IV, PTB-XL and PTB dataset respectively outperforming PatchTST, Reformer, Transformer, and Medformer models. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, achieving 49.18% AUROC on PTB and 68.41% on PTB-XL when trained on MIMIC-IV. These findings underscore the potential of Cardioformer to advance automated ECG analysis, paving the way for more accurate and robust cardiovascular disease diagnosis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbo Wang, Xiyuan Wang, Quan Gan, Minjie Wang, Qibin Yang, David Wipf, Muhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Griffin, the first foundation model attemptation designed specifically for Relational Databases (RDBs). Unlike previous smaller models focused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder to handle diverse tasks. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by incorporating a cross-attention module and a novel aggregator. Griffin utilizes pretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders for categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative components such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on large-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across various domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates superior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in low-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and diversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its potential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs.

<p>Abstract: Existing biomedical benchmarks do not provide end-to-end infrastructure for training, evaluation, and inference of models that integrate multimodal biological data and a broad range of machine learning tasks in therapeutics. We present PyTDC, an open-source machine-learning platform providing streamlined training, evaluation, and inference software for multimodal biological AI models. PyTDC unifies distributed, heterogeneous, continuously updated data sources and model weights and standardizes benchmarking and inference endpoints. This paper discusses the components of PyTDC's architecture and, to our knowledge, the first-of-its-kind case study on the introduced single-cell drug-target nomination ML task. We find state-of-the-art methods in graph representation learning and domain-specific methods from graph theory perform poorly on this task. Though we find a context-aware geometric deep learning method that outperforms the evaluated SoTA and domain-specific baseline methods, the model is unable to generalize to unseen cell types or incorporate additional modalities, highlighting PyTDC's capacity to facilitate an exciting avenue of research developing multimodal, context-aware, foundation models for open problems in biomedical AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sura Alhanouti, Parinaz Naghizadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning algorithms increasingly influence critical decision making in different application areas, understanding human strategic behavior in response to these systems becomes vital. We explore individuals' choice between genuinely improving their qualifications (``improvement'') vs. attempting to deceive the algorithm by manipulating their features (``manipulation'') in response to an algorithmic decision system. We further investigate an algorithm designer's ability to shape these strategic responses, and its fairness implications. Specifically, we formulate these interactions as a Stackelberg game, where a firm deploys a (fair) classifier, and individuals strategically respond. Our model incorporates both different costs and stochastic efficacy for manipulation and improvement. The analysis reveals different potential classes of agent responses, and characterizes optimal classifiers accordingly. Based on these, we highlight the impact of the firm's anticipation of strategic behavior, identifying when and why a (fair) strategic policy can not only prevent manipulation, but also incentivize agents to opt for improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacek Karolczak, Jerzy Stefanowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Although prototype-based explanations provide a human-understandable way of representing model predictions they often fail to direct user attention to the most relevant features. We propose a novel approach to identify the most informative features within prototypes, termed alike parts. Using feature importance scores derived from an agnostic explanation method, it emphasizes the most relevant overlapping features between an instance and its nearest prototype. Furthermore, the feature importance score is incorporated into the objective function of the prototype selection algorithms to promote global prototypes diversity. Through experiments on six benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach improves user comprehension while maintaining or even increasing predictive accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05605">The Evolution of Embedding Table Optimization and Multi-Epoch Training in Pinterest Ads Conversion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Qiu, Shubham Barhate, Hin Wai Lui, Runze Su, Rafael Rios M\"uller, Kungang Li, Ling Leng, Han Sun, Shayan Ehsani, Zhifang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning for conversion prediction has found widespread applications in online advertising. These models have become more complex as they are trained to jointly predict multiple objectives such as click, add-to-cart, checkout and other conversion types. Additionally, the capacity and performance of these models can often be increased with the use of embedding tables that encode high cardinality categorical features such as advertiser, user, campaign, and product identifiers (IDs). These embedding tables can be pre-trained, but also learned end-to-end jointly with the model to directly optimize the model objectives. Training these large tables is challenging due to: gradient sparsity, the high cardinality of the categorical features, the non-uniform distribution of IDs and the very high label sparsity. These issues make training prone to both slow convergence and overfitting after the first epoch. Previous works addressed the multi-epoch overfitting issue by using: stronger feature hashing to reduce cardinality, filtering of low frequency IDs, regularization of the embedding tables, re-initialization of the embedding tables after each epoch, etc. Some of these techniques reduce overfitting at the expense of reduced model performance if used too aggressively. In this paper, we share key learnings from the development of embedding table optimization and multi-epoch training in Pinterest Ads Conversion models. We showcase how our Sparse Optimizer speeds up convergence, and how multi-epoch overfitting varies in severity between different objectives in a multi-task model depending on label sparsity. We propose a new approach to deal with multi-epoch overfitting: the use of a frequency-adaptive learning rate on the embedding tables and compare it to embedding re-initialization. We evaluate both methods offline using an industrial large-scale production dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasilis Pollatos, Debmalya Mandal, Goran Radanovic</p>
<p>Abstract: In performative Reinforcement Learning (RL), an agent faces a policy-dependent environment: the reward and transition functions depend on the agent's policy. Prior work on performative RL has studied the convergence of repeated retraining approaches to a performatively stable policy. In the finite sample regime, these approaches repeatedly solve for a saddle point of a convex-concave objective, which estimates the Lagrangian of a regularized version of the reinforcement learning problem. In this paper, we aim to extend such repeated retraining approaches, enabling them to operate under corrupted data. More specifically, we consider Huber's $\epsilon$-contamination model, where an $\epsilon$ fraction of data points is corrupted by arbitrary adversarial noise. We propose a repeated retraining approach based on convex-concave optimization under corrupted gradients and a novel problem-specific robust mean estimator for the gradients. We prove that our approach exhibits last-iterate convergence to an approximately stable policy, with the approximation error linear in $\sqrt{\epsilon}$. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of accounting for corruption in performative RL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Estimating rate constants from complex chemical reactions is essential for advancing detailed chemistry. However, the stiffness inherent in real-world atmospheric chemistry systems poses severe challenges, leading to training instability and poor convergence that hinder effective rate constant estimation using learning-based approaches. To address this, we propose a Stiff Physics-Informed Neural ODE framework (SPIN-ODE) for chemical reaction modelling. Our method introduces a three-stage optimisation process: first, a latent neural ODE learns the continuous and differentiable trajectory between chemical concentrations and their time derivatives; second, an explicit Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN) extracts the underlying rate coefficients based on the learned dynamics; and third, fine-tune CRNN using a neural ODE solver to further improve rate coefficient estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and newly proposed real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. As the first work on stiff Neural ODEs for chemical rate coefficient discovery, our study opens promising directions for integrating neural networks with detailed chemistry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tien Dang, Truong-Son Hy</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular interactions often involve high-order relationships that cannot be fully captured by traditional graph-based models limited to pairwise connections. Hypergraphs naturally extend graphs by enabling multi-way interactions, making them well-suited for modeling complex molecular systems. In this work, we introduce EquiHGNN, an Equivariant HyperGraph Neural Network framework that integrates symmetry-aware representations to improve molecular modeling. By enforcing the equivariance under relevant transformation groups, our approach preserves geometric and topological properties, leading to more robust and physically meaningful representations. We examine a range of equivariant architectures and demonstrate that integrating symmetry constraints leads to notable performance gains on large-scale molecular datasets. Experiments on both small and large molecules show that high-order interactions offer limited benefits for small molecules but consistently outperform 2D graphs on larger ones. Adding geometric features to these high-order structures further improves the performance, emphasizing the value of spatial information in molecular learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Winston Chen, Trenton Chang, Jenna Wiens</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects can inform treatment decisions. Under the presence of non-adherence (e.g., patients do not adhere to their assigned treatment), both the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD) and the conditional front-door adjustment (CFD) can recover unbiased estimates of the treatment assignment effects. However, the estimation variance of these approaches may vary widely across settings, which remains underexplored in the literature. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that CFD yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true effect of treatment assignment is small (i.e., assigning an intervention leads to small changes in patients' future outcome). Additionally, since CFD requires estimating multiple nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network that implements CFD with joint modeling of the nuisance parameters. Empirically, LobsterNet reduces estimation error across several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets compared to baselines. Our findings suggest CFD with shared nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment assignment effect estimation under non-adherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongjin Choi, Gahee Kim, Yong-Geun Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: The absence of intrinsic adjacency relations and orientation systems in hypergraphs creates fundamental challenges for constructing sheaf Laplacians of arbitrary degrees. We resolve these limitations through symmetric simplicial sets derived directly from hypergraphs, which encode all possible oriented subrelations within each hyperedge as ordered tuples. This construction canonically defines adjacency via facet maps while inherently preserving hyperedge provenance. We establish that the normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian on our induced symmetric simplicial set reduces exactly to the traditional graph normalized sheaf Laplacian when restricted to graphs, validating its mathematical consistency with prior graph-based sheaf theory. Furthermore, the induced structure preserves all structural information from the original hypergraph, ensuring that every multi-way relational detail is faithfully retained. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Hypergraph Neural Sheaf Diffusion (HNSD), the first principled extension of Neural Sheaf Diffusion (NSD) to hypergraphs. HNSD operates via normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacians over symmetric simplicial sets, resolving orientation ambiguity and adjacency sparsity inherent to hypergraph learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate HNSD's competitive performance across established benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rushabh Solanki, Meghana Bhange, Ulrich A\"ivodji, Elliot Creager</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of AI into daily life has generated considerable attention and excitement, while also raising concerns about automating algorithmic harms and re-entrenching existing social inequities. While the responsible deployment of trustworthy AI systems is a worthy goal, there are many possible ways to realize it, from policy and regulation to improved algorithm design and evaluation. In fact, since AI trains on social data, there is even a possibility for everyday users, citizens, or workers to directly steer its behavior through Algorithmic Collective Action, by deliberately modifying the data they share with a platform to drive its learning process in their favor. This paper considers how these grassroots efforts to influence AI interact with methods already used by AI firms and governments to improve model trustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the setting where the AI firm deploys a differentially private model, motivated by the growing regulatory focus on privacy and data protection. We investigate how the use of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) affects the collective's ability to influence the learning process. Our findings show that while differential privacy contributes to the protection of individual data, it introduces challenges for effective algorithmic collective action. We characterize lower bounds on the success of algorithmic collective action under differential privacy as a function of the collective's size and the firm's privacy parameters, and verify these trends experimentally by simulating collective action during the training of deep neural network classifiers across several datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Limai Jiang, Yunpeng Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models capture the true distribution of data, yielding semantically rich representations. Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) exhibit superior generative capabilities, though efficient representation learning for them are lacking. In this work, we employ a multi-level denoising autoencoder framework to expand the representation capacity of DDMs, which introduces sequentially consistent Diffusion Transformers and an additional timestep-dependent encoder to acquire embedding representations on the denoising Markov chain through self-conditional diffusion learning. Intuitively, the encoder, conditioned on the entire diffusion process, compresses high-dimensional data into directional vectors in latent under different noise levels, facilitating the learning of image embeddings across all timesteps. To verify the semantic adequacy of embeddings generated through this approach, extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, demonstrating that optimally learned embeddings by DDMs surpass state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning methods in most cases, achieving remarkable discriminative semantic representation quality. Our work justifies that DDMs are not only suitable for generative tasks, but also potentially advantageous for general-purpose deep learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Niu, Jinliang Deng, Lulu Zhang, Zimu Zhou, Yongxin Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is essential for applications such as traffic management and weather prediction, which depend on capturing long-range temporal dependencies and interactions between entities. Existing methods, particularly those based on Transformer architectures, compute pairwise dependencies across all time steps, leading to a computational complexity that scales quadratically with the length of the input. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Forecaster with Offline Clustering Using Segments (FOCUS), a novel approach to MTS forecasting that simplifies long-range dependency modeling through the use of prototypes extracted via offline clustering. These prototypes encapsulate high-level events in the real-world system underlying the data, summarizing the key characteristics of similar time segments. In the online phase, FOCUS dynamically adapts these patterns to the current input and captures dependencies between the input segment and high-level events, enabling both accurate and efficient forecasting. By identifying prototypes during the offline clustering phase, FOCUS reduces the computational complexity of modeling long-range dependencies in the online phase to linear scaling. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi He, Yi Miao, Max A. Little</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the first globally optimal algorithm for the empirical risk minimization problem of two-layer maxout and ReLU networks, i.e., minimizing the number of misclassifications. The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of $O\left(N^{DK+1}\right)$, where $K$ denotes the number of hidden neurons and $D$ represents the number of features. It can be can be generalized to accommodate arbitrary computable loss functions without affecting its computational complexity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides provably exact solutions for small-scale datasets. To handle larger datasets, we introduce a novel coreset selection method that reduces the data size to a manageable scale, making it feasible for our algorithm. This extension enables efficient processing of large-scale datasets and achieves significantly improved performance, with a 20-30\% reduction in misclassifications for both training and prediction, compared to state-of-the-art approaches (neural networks trained using gradient descent and support vector machines), when applied to the same models (two-layer networks with fixed hidden nodes and linear models).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruxue Shi, Hengrui Gu, Xu Shen, Xin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in solving complex tasks, making them a promising tool for enhancing tabular learning. However, existing LLM-based methods suffer from high resource requirements, suboptimal demonstration selection, and limited interpretability, which largely hinder their prediction performance and application in the real world. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel in-context learning framework for tabular prediction. The core idea is to leverage the explanations generated by LLMs to guide a smaller, locally deployable Surrogate Language Model (SLM) to make interpretable tabular predictions. Specifically, our framework mainly involves three stages: (i) Post Hoc Explanation Generation, where LLMs are utilized to generate explanations for question-answer pairs in candidate demonstrations, providing insights into the reasoning behind the answer. (ii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Demonstrations Selection, which utilizes explanations generated by LLMs to guide the process of demonstration selection from candidate demonstrations. (iii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Interpretable SLM Prediction, which utilizes the demonstrations obtained in step (ii) as in-context and merges corresponding explanations as rationales to improve the performance of SLM and guide the model to generate interpretable outputs. Experimental results highlight the framework's effectiveness, with an average accuracy improvement of 5.31% across various tabular datasets in diverse domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Academic misconduct detection in biomedical research remains challenging due to algorithmic narrowness in existing methods and fragmented analytical pipelines. We present BMMDetect, a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates journal metadata (SJR, institutional data), semantic embeddings (PubMedBERT), and GPT-4o-mined textual attributes (methodological statistics, data anomalies) for holistic manuscript evaluation. Key innovations include: (1) multimodal fusion of domain-specific features to reduce detection bias; (2) quantitative evaluation of feature importance, identifying journal authority metrics (e.g., SJR-index) and textual anomalies (e.g., statistical outliers) as dominant predictors; and (3) the BioMCD dataset, a large-scale benchmark with 13,160 retracted articles and 53,411 controls. BMMDetect achieves 74.33% AUC, outperforming single-modality baselines by 8.6%, and demonstrates transferability across biomedical subfields. This work advances scalable, interpretable tools for safeguarding research integrity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henan Sun, Xunkai Li, Lei Zhu, Junyi Han, Guang Zeng, Ronghua Li, Guoren Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization has gained increasing attentions for machine learning on graphs, as graph neural networks (GNNs) often exhibit performance degradation under distribution shifts. Existing graph OOD methods tend to follow the basic ideas of invariant risk minimization and structural causal models, interpreting the invariant knowledge across datasets under various distribution shifts as graph topology or graph spectrum. However, these interpretations may be inconsistent with real-world scenarios, as neither invariant topology nor spectrum is assured. In this paper, we advocate the learnable random walk (LRW) perspective as the instantiation of invariant knowledge, and propose LRW-OOD to realize graph OOD generalization learning. Instead of employing fixed probability transition matrix (i.e., degree-normalized adjacency matrix), we parameterize the transition matrix with an LRW-sampler and a path encoder. Furthermore, we propose the kernel density estimation (KDE)-based mutual information (MI) loss to generate random walk sequences that adhere to OOD principles. Extensive experiment demonstrates that our model can effectively enhance graph OOD generalization under various types of distribution shifts and yield a significant accuracy improvement of 3.87% over state-of-the-art graph OOD generalization baselines.</p>

Ablation studies further confirm that ECOC consistently enhances performance across FastKAN and FasterKAN variants. These results demonstrate that ECOC integration significantly boosts KAN generalizability in critical healthcare AI applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integration of ECOC with KAN for enhancing multi-class medical image classification performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face deployment challenges due to their large parameter counts and computational demands. We explore quantization for MoE models and highlight two key insights: 1) linear blocks exhibit varying quantization sensitivity, and 2) divergent expert activation frequencies create heterogeneous computational characteristics. Based on these observations, we introduce MxMoE, a mixed-precision optimization framework for MoE models that considers both algorithmic and system perspectives. MxMoE navigates the design space defined by parameter sensitivity, expert activation dynamics, and hardware resources to derive efficient mixed-precision configurations. Additionally, MxMoE automatically generates optimized mixed-precision GroupGEMM kernels, enabling parallel execution of GEMMs with different precisions. Evaluations show that MxMoE outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.4 lower Wikitext-2 perplexity than GPTQ at 2.25-bit and delivering up to 3.4x speedup over full precision, as well as up to 29.4% speedup over uniform quantization at equivalent accuracy with 5-bit weight-activation quantization.

<p>Abstract: The state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of electric vehicles. Nevertheless, the prevailing SOH estimation methods often have limited generalizability. This paper introduces a data-driven approach for estimating the SOH of LIBs, which is designed to improve generalization. We construct a hybrid model named ACLA, which integrates the attention mechanism, convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory network (LSTM) into the augmented neural ordinary differential equation (ANODE) framework. This model employs normalized charging time corresponding to specific voltages in the constant current charging phase as input and outputs the SOH as well as remaining useful of life. The model is trained on NASA and Oxford datasets and validated on the TJU and HUST datasets. Compared to the benchmark models NODE and ANODE, ACLA exhibits higher accuracy with root mean square errors (RMSE) for SOH estimation as low as 1.01% and 2.24% on the TJU and HUST datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiufu Li, Huibin Xiao, Linlin Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: When training classification models, it expects that the learned features are compact within classes, and can well separate different classes. As the dominant loss function for training classification models, minimizing cross-entropy (CE) loss maximizes the compactness and distinctiveness, i.e., reaching neural collapse (NC). The recent works show that binary CE (BCE) performs also well in multi-class tasks. In this paper, we compare BCE and CE in deep feature learning. For the first time, we prove that BCE can also maximize the intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness when reaching its minimum, i.e., leading to NC. We point out that CE measures the relative values of decision scores in the model training, implicitly enhancing the feature properties by classifying samples one-by-one. In contrast, BCE measures the absolute values of decision scores and adjust the positive/negative decision scores across all samples to uniformly high/low levels. Meanwhile, the classifier biases in BCE present a substantial constraint on the decision scores to explicitly enhance the feature properties in the training. The experimental results are aligned with above analysis, and show that BCE could improve the classification and leads to better compactness and distinctiveness among sample features. The codes will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning junta distributions on $\{0, 1\}^n$, where a distribution is a $k$-junta if its probability mass function depends on a subset of at most $k$ variables. We make two main contributions:
  - We show that learning $k$-junta distributions is \emph{computationally} equivalent to learning $k$-parity functions with noise (LPN), a landmark problem in computational learning theory.
  - We design an algorithm for learning junta distributions whose statistical complexity is optimal, up to polylogarithmic factors. Computationally, our algorithm matches the complexity of previous (non-sample-optimal) algorithms.
  Combined, our two contributions imply that our algorithm cannot be significantly improved, statistically or computationally, barring a breakthrough for LPN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Justin, Qingshi Sun, Andr\'es G\'omez, Phebe Vayanos</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last few decades, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved significant success across domains ranging from healthcare, sustainability, and the social sciences, to criminal justice and finance. But its deployment in increasingly sophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups they belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around fairness, transparency, robustness, and privacy, among others. As the complexity and scale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are deployed grow, so does the need for responsible ML methods that address these challenges while providing guaranteed performance in deployment.
  Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding responsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while maintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently transparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain specific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and comprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and practical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML, their importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building ML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical formulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for efficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML. It concludes with a discussion on current limitations and open research questions, providing suggestions for future work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open set label shift (OSLS) occurs when label distributions change from a source to a target distribution, and the target distribution has an additional out-of-distribution (OOD) class. In this work, we build estimators for both source and target open set label distributions using a source domain in-distribution (ID) classifier and an ID/OOD classifier. With reasonable assumptions on the ID/OOD classifier, the estimators are assembled into a sequence of three stages: 1) an estimate of the source label distribution of the OOD class, 2) an EM algorithm for Maximum Likelihood estimates (MLE) of the target label distribution, and 3) an estimate of the target label distribution of OOD class under relaxed assumptions on the OOD classifier. The sampling errors of estimates in 1) and 3) are quantified with a concentration inequality. The estimation result allows us to correct the ID classifier trained on the source distribution to the target distribution without retraining. Experiments on a variety of open set label shift settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChangkunYe/OpenSetLabelShift.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a promising approach for uncovering the underlying laws governing complex systems. However, purely data driven techniques face the dilemma of balancing search space with optimization efficiency. This study introduces a knowledge guided approach that incorporates existing PDEs documented in a mathematical handbook to facilitate the discovery process. These PDEs are encoded as sentence like structures composed of operators and basic terms, and used to train a generative model, called EqGPT, which enables the generation of free form PDEs. A loop of generation evaluation optimization is constructed to autonomously identify the most suitable PDE. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework can recover a variety of PDE forms with high accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in cases involving complex temporal derivatives or intricate spatial terms, which are often beyond the reach of conventional methods. The approach also exhibits generalizability to irregular spatial domains and higher dimensional settings. Notably, it succeeds in discovering a previously unreported PDE governing strongly nonlinear surface gravity waves propagating toward breaking, based on real world experimental data, highlighting its applicability to practical scenarios and its potential to support scientific discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating molecules that bind to specific protein targets via diffusion models has shown good promise for structure-based drug design and molecule optimization. Especially, the diffusion models with binding interaction guidance enables molecule generation with high affinity through forming favorable interaction within protein pocket. However, the generated molecules may not form interactions with the highly conserved residues, which are important for protein functions and bioactivities of the ligands. Herein, we developed a new 3D target-aware diffusion model DiffDecip, which explicitly incorporates the protein-ligand binding interactions and evolutionary conservation information of protein residues into both diffusion and sampling process, for molecule optimization through scaffold decoration. The model performance revealed that DiffDecip outperforms baseline model DiffDec on molecule optimization towards higher affinity through forming more non-covalent interactions with highly conserved residues in the protein pocket.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Yin, Ruyue Liu, Xiaoshuai Hao, Xingrui Zhou, Yong Liu, Can Ma, Weiping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate extraction of molecular representations is a critical step in the drug discovery process. In recent years, significant progress has been made in molecular representation learning methods, among which multi-modal molecular representation methods based on images, and 2D/3D topologies have become increasingly mainstream. However, existing these multi-modal approaches often directly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential of intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex higher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To overcome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal self-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed to enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge between molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal molecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module. The multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively processes information from different modalities of the same molecule to overcome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding. Subsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular representation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order correlations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism for storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory anchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the model generalization ability. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of MMSA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MoleculeNet benchmark, with average ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 1.8% to 9.6% over baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhou, Yibo Wang, Chao Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world datasets are time series that are sequentially collected and contain rich temporal information. Thus, a common interest in practice is to capture dynamics of time series and predict their future evolutions. To this end, the recurrent neural network (RNN) has been a prevalent and effective machine learning option, which admits a nonlinear state-space model representation. Motivated by the resemblance between RNN and Kalman filter (KF) for linear state-space models, we propose in this paper Innovation-driven RNN (IRNN), a novel RNN architecture tailored to time-series data modeling and prediction tasks. By adapting the concept of "innovation" from KF to RNN, past prediction errors are adopted as additional input signals to update hidden states of RNN and boost prediction performance. Since innovation data depend on network parameters, existing training algorithms for RNN do not apply to IRNN straightforwardly. Thus, a tailored training algorithm dubbed input updating-based back-propagation through time (IU-BPTT) is further proposed, which alternates between updating innovations and optimizing network parameters via gradient descent. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets show that the integration of innovations into various forms of RNN leads to remarkably improved prediction accuracy of IRNN without increasing the training cost substantially.</p>

<p>Abstract: In class-incremental learning (CIL), effective incremental learning strategies are essential to mitigate task confusion and catastrophic forgetting, especially as the number of tasks $t$ increases. Current exemplar replay strategies impose $\mathcal{O}(t)$ memory/compute complexities. We propose an autoencoder-based hybrid replay (AHR) strategy that leverages our new hybrid autoencoder (HAE) to function as a compressor to alleviate the requirement for large memory, achieving $\mathcal{O}(0.1 t)$ at the worst case with the computing complexity of $\mathcal{O}(t)$ while accomplishing state-of-the-art performance. The decoder later recovers the exemplar data stored in the latent space, rather than in raw format. Additionally, HAE is designed for both discriminative and generative modeling, enabling classification and replay capabilities, respectively. HAE adopts the charged particle system energy minimization equations and repulsive force algorithm for the incremental embedding and distribution of new class centroids in its latent space. Our results demonstrate that AHR consistently outperforms recent baselines across multiple benchmarks while operating with the same memory/compute budgets. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Zhou, Zheng Li, Jun Zhang, Jue Wang, Yiping Wang, Zhongle Xie, Ke Chen, Lidan Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, there is a growing demand for efficient inference on memory-constrained devices. While offloading expert parameters to CPU memory and loading activated experts on demand has emerged as a potential solution, the large size of activated experts overburdens the limited PCIe bandwidth, hindering the effectiveness in latency-sensitive scenarios. To mitigate this, we propose FloE, an on-the-fly MoE inference system on memory-constrained GPUs. FloE is built on the insight that there exists substantial untapped redundancy within sparsely activated experts. It employs various compression techniques on the expert's internal parameter matrices to reduce the data movement load, combined with low-cost sparse prediction, achieving perceptible inference acceleration in wall-clock time on resource-constrained devices. Empirically, FloE achieves a 9.3x compression of parameters per expert in Mixtral-8x7B; enables deployment on a GPU with only 11GB VRAM, reducing the memory footprint by up to 8.5x; and delivers a 48.7x inference speedup compared to DeepSpeed-MII on a single GeForce RTX 3090.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uyoata E. Uyoata, Gilberto Berardinelli, Ramoni Adeogun</p>
<p>Abstract: In-X Subnetworks are envisioned to meet the stringent demands of short-range communication in diverse 6G use cases. In the context of In-Factory scenarios, effective power control is critical to mitigating the impact of interference resulting from potentially high subnetwork density. Existing approaches to power control in this domain have predominantly emphasized the data plane, often overlooking the impact of signaling overhead. Furthermore, prior work has typically adopted a network-centric perspective, relying on the assumption of complete and up-to-date channel state information (CSI) being readily available at the central controller. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to enable access points to autonomously learn both signaling and power control protocols in an In-Factory Subnetwork environment. By formulating the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and leveraging multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), the proposed approach achieves significant advantages. The simulation results demonstrate that the learning-based method reduces signaling overhead by a factor of 8 while maintaining a buffer flush rate that lags the ideal "Genie" approach by only 5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Qiao, Wenhao Li, Shanchao Yang, Hongyuan Zha, Baoxiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces critical challenges due to distributional shifts, further exacerbated by the high dimensionality of joint action spaces and the diversity in coordination strategies and quality among agents. Conventional approaches, including independent learning frameworks and value decomposition methods based on pessimistic principles, remain susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions and often yield suboptimal performance. Through systematic analysis of prevalent offline MARL benchmarks, we identify that this limitation primarily stems from the inherently multimodal nature of joint collaborative policies induced by offline data collection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework: First, we employ a diffusion-based generative model to explicitly capture the complex behavior policy, enabling accurate modeling of diverse multi-agent coordination patterns. Second, we introduce a sequential score function decomposition mechanism to regularize individual policies and enable decentralized execution. Extensive experiments on continuous control tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple standard offline MARL benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by 26.3\% in normalized returns. Our approach provides new insights into offline coordination and equilibrium selection in cooperative multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Mohan, Biyan Zhou, Zhou Wang, Anil Bharath, Emmanuel Drakakis, Arindam Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents an efficient decoding pipeline for neuromorphic implantable brain-machine interfaces (Neu-iBMI), leveraging sparse neural event data from an event-based neural sensing scheme. We introduce a tunable event filter (EvFilter), which also functions as a spike detector (EvFilter-SPD), significantly reducing the number of events processed for decoding by 192X and 554X, respectively. The proposed pipeline achieves high decoding performance, up to R^2=0.73, with ANN- and SNN-based decoders, eliminating the need for signal recovery, spike detection, or sorting, commonly performed in conventional iBMI systems. The SNN-Decoder reduces computations and memory required by 5-23X compared to NN-, and LSTM-Decoders, while the ST-NN-Decoder delivers similar performance to an LSTM-Decoder requiring 2.5X fewer resources. This streamlined approach significantly reduces computational and memory demands, making it ideal for low-power, on-implant, or wearable iBMIs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephan Bartl, Kevin Innerebner, Elisabeth Lex</p>
<p>Abstract: As recommender systems become increasingly complex, transparency is essential to increase user trust, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Neuro-symbolic approaches that integrate symbolic reasoning with sub-symbolic learning offer a promising approach toward transparent and user-centric systems. In this work-in-progress, we investigate using fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) as a neuro-symbolic approach for recommendations that learn logic-based rules over predefined, human-readable atoms. Each rule corresponds to a fuzzy logic expression, making the recommender's decision process inherently transparent. In contrast to black-box machine learning methods, our approach reveals the reasoning behind a recommendation while maintaining competitive performance. We evaluate our method on a synthetic and MovieLens 1M datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. Our results demonstrate that our approach accurately captures user behavior while providing a transparent decision-making process. Finally, the differentiable nature of this approach facilitates an integration with other neural models, enabling the development of hybrid, transparent recommender systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Shiraishi, Yohei Hayamizu, Tomonori Hashiyama</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the impact of rule representation in Michigan-style Learning Fuzzy-Classifier Systems (LFCSs) on its classification performance. A well-representation of the rules in an LFCS is crucial for improving its performance. However, conventional rule representations frequently need help addressing problems with unknown data characteristics. To address this issue, this paper proposes a supervised LFCS (i.e., Fuzzy-UCS) with a self-adaptive rule representation mechanism, entitled Adaptive-UCS. Adaptive-UCS incorporates a fuzzy indicator as a new rule parameter that sets the membership function of a rule as either rectangular (i.e., crisp) or triangular (i.e., fuzzy) shapes. The fuzzy indicator is optimized with evolutionary operators, allowing the system to search for an optimal rule representation. Results from extensive experiments conducted on continuous space problems demonstrate that Adaptive-UCS outperforms other UCSs with conventional crisp-hyperrectangular and fuzzy-hypertrapezoidal rule representations in classification accuracy. Additionally, Adaptive-UCS exhibits robustness in the case of noisy inputs and real-world problems with inherent uncertainty, such as missing values, leading to stable classification performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: The approximation capabilities of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) are commonly justified by general Universal Approximation Theorems (UATs) that do not leverage the intrinsic structural properties of the optimal Q-function, the solution to a Bellman equation. This paper establishes a UAT for a class of DQNs whose architecture is designed to emulate the iterative refinement process inherent in Bellman updates. A central element of our analysis is the propagation of regularity: while the transformation induced by a single Bellman operator application exhibits regularity, for which Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) theory provides analytical tools, the uniform regularity of the entire sequence of value iteration iterates--specifically, their uniform Lipschitz continuity on compact domains under standard Lipschitz assumptions on the problem data--is derived from finite-horizon dynamic programming principles. We demonstrate that layers of a deep residual network, conceived as neural operators acting on function spaces, can approximate the action of the Bellman operator. The resulting approximation theorem is thus intrinsically linked to the control problem's structure, offering a proof technique wherein network depth directly corresponds to iterations of value function refinement, accompanied by controlled error propagation. This perspective reveals a dynamic systems view of the network's operation on a space of value functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leon Eshuijs, Shihan Wang, Antske Fokkens</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliance on spurious correlations (shortcuts) has been shown to underlie many of the successes of language models. Previous work focused on identifying the input elements that impact prediction. We investigate how shortcuts are actually processed within the model's decision-making mechanism. We use actor names in movie reviews as controllable shortcuts with known impact on the outcome. We use mechanistic interpretability methods and identify specific attention heads that focus on shortcuts. These heads gear the model towards a label before processing the complete input, effectively making premature decisions that bypass contextual analysis. Based on these findings, we introduce Head-based Token Attribution (HTA), which traces intermediate decisions back to input tokens. We show that HTA is effective in detecting shortcuts in LLMs and enables targeted mitigation by selectively deactivating shortcut-related attention heads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rustem Islamov, Yarden As, Ilyas Fatkhullin</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning faces severe communication bottlenecks due to the high dimensionality of model updates. Communication compression with contractive compressors (e.g., Top-K) is often preferable in practice but can degrade performance without proper handling. Error feedback (EF) mitigates such issues but has been largely restricted for smooth, unconstrained problems, limiting its real-world applicability where non-smooth objectives and safety constraints are critical. We advance our understanding of EF in the canonical non-smooth convex setting by establishing new lower complexity bounds for first-order algorithms with contractive compression. Next, we propose Safe-EF, a novel algorithm that matches our lower bound (up to a constant) while enforcing safety constraints essential for practical applications. Extending our approach to the stochastic setting, we bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation. Extensive experiments in a reinforcement learning setup, simulating distributed humanoid robot training, validate the effectiveness of Safe-EF in ensuring safety and reducing communication complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents an integrated methodology for fault detection in wind turbine blades using 3D-printed scaled models, finite element simulations, experimental modal analysis, and machine learning techniques. A scaled model of the NREL 5MW blade was fabricated using 3D printing, and crack-type damages were introduced at critical locations. Finite Element Analysis was employed to predict the impact of these damages on the natural frequencies, with the results validated through controlled hammer impact tests. Vibration data was processed to extract both time-domain and frequency-domain features, and key discriminative variables were identified using statistical analyses (ANOVA). Machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors, achieved classification accuracies exceeding 94%. The results revealed that vibration modes 3, 4, and 6 are particularly sensitive to structural anomalies for this blade. This integrated approach confirms the feasibility of combining numerical simulations with experimental validations and paves the way for structural health monitoring systems in wind energy applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergio Garc\'ia-Heredia, \'Angela Fern\'andez, Carlos M. Ala\'iz</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the fundamental problems within the field of machine learning is dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction methods make it possible to combat the so-called curse of dimensionality, visualize high-dimensional data and, in general, improve the efficiency of storing and processing large data sets. One of the best-known nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods is Diffusion Maps. However, despite their virtues, both Diffusion Maps and many other manifold learning methods based on the spectral decomposition of kernel matrices have drawbacks such as the inability to apply them to data outside the initial set, their computational complexity, and high memory costs for large data sets. In this work, we propose to alleviate these problems by resorting to deep learning. Specifically, a new formulation of Diffusion Maps embedding is offered as a solution to a certain unconstrained minimization problem and, based on it, a cost function to train a neural network which computes Diffusion Maps embedding -- both inside and outside the training sample -- without the need to perform any spectral decomposition. The capabilities of this approach are compared on different data sets, both real and synthetic, with those of Diffusion Maps and the Nystrom method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinxin Li, Juan Zhang, Da Li, Xingyu Liu, Jin Xu, Junping Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for automatically discovering mathematical expressions from input data. Mainstream SR algorithms search for the optimal symbolic tree in a vast function space, but the increasing complexity of the tree structure limits their performance. Inspired by neural networks, symbolic networks have emerged as a promising new paradigm. However, most existing symbolic networks still face certain challenges: binary nonlinear operators $\{\times, \div\}$ cannot be naturally extended to multivariate operators, and training with fixed architecture often leads to higher complexity and overfitting. In this work, we propose a Unified Symbolic Network that unifies nonlinear binary operators into nested unary operators and define the conditions under which UniSymNet can reduce complexity. Moreover, we pre-train a Transformer model with a novel label encoding method to guide structural selection, and adopt objective-specific optimization strategies to learn the parameters of the symbolic network. UniSymNet shows high fitting accuracy, excellent symbolic solution rate, and relatively low expression complexity, achieving competitive performance on low-dimensional Standard Benchmarks and high-dimensional SRBench.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on eight diverse biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning, virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study period, with the top model now performing twice as well as expert virologists. Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other challenging benchmarks, including LAB-Bench CloningScenarios and the biology subsets of GPQA and WMDP. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below 100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Analyzing time series data is crucial to a wide spectrum of applications, including economics, online marketplaces, and human healthcare. In particular, time series classification plays an indispensable role in segmenting different phases in stock markets, predicting customer behavior, and classifying worker actions and engagement levels. These aspects contribute significantly to the advancement of automated decision-making and system optimization in real-world applications. However, there is a large consensus that time series data often suffers from domain shifts between training and test sets, which dramatically degrades the classification performance. Despite the success of (reversible) instance normalization in handling the domain shifts for time series regression tasks, its performance in classification is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose \textit{FIC-TSC}, a training framework for time series classification that leverages Fisher information as the constraint. We theoretically and empirically show this is an efficient and effective solution to guide the model converge toward flatter minima, which enhances its generalizability to distribution shifts. We rigorously evaluate our method on 30 UEA multivariate and 85 UCR univariate datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over 14 recent state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian F. Schumann, Jeroen Hagenus, Frederik Baymler Mathiesen, Arkady Zgonnikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a key element of autonomous vehicle systems, enabling them to anticipate and react to the movements of other road users. Evaluating the robustness of prediction models against adversarial attacks is essential to ensure their reliability in real-world traffic. However, current approaches tend to focus on perturbing the past positions of surrounding agents, which can generate unrealistic scenarios and overlook critical vulnerabilities. This limitation may result in overly optimistic assessments of model performance in real-world conditions.
  In this work, we demonstrate that perturbing not just past but also future states of adversarial agents can uncover previously undetected weaknesses and thereby provide a more rigorous evaluation of model robustness. Our novel approach incorporates dynamic constraints and preserves tactical behaviors, enabling more effective and realistic adversarial attacks. We introduce new performance measures to assess the realism and impact of these adversarial trajectories. Testing our method on a state-of-the-art prediction model revealed significant increases in prediction errors and collision rates under adversarial conditions. Qualitative analysis further showed that our attacks can expose critical weaknesses, such as the inability of the model to detect potential collisions in what appear to be safe predictions. These results underscore the need for more comprehensive adversarial testing to better evaluate and improve the reliability of trajectory prediction models for autonomous vehicles.</p>

We prove a sharp $n$ lower bound on the ICNN depth complexity of MAX$_n$. We also prove depth separations between ReLU networks and ICNNs; for every $k$, there is a depth-2 ReLU network of size $O(k^2)$ that cannot be simulated by a depth-$k$ ICNN. The proofs are based on deep connections between neural networks and polyhedral geometry, and also use isoperimetric properties of triangulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linjiang Cao, Maonan Wang, Xi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability, we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer training steps required for convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Hasegawa, Yukihiko Okada</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern data-driven tasks such as classification, optimization, and forecasting, mitigating the effects of intrinsic noise is crucial for improving predictive accuracy. While numerous denoising techniques have been developed, the rising dimensionality of real-world datasets limits conventional matrix-based methods in preserving data structure and accuracy. This challenge has led to increasing interest in tensor-based approaches, which naturally capture multi-way data relationships. However, classical tensor decomposition methods (e.g., HOSVD, HOOI) typically require pre-specified ranks and iterative optimization, making them computationally expensive and less practical. In this work, we propose a novel low-rank approximation method for tensor data that avoids these limitations. Our approach applies statistically grounded singular value thresholding to mode-wise matricizations, enabling automatic extraction of significant components without requiring prior rank specification or iterative refinement. Experiments on synthetic and real-world tensors show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency, especially in noisy high-dimensional settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Plachouras, Julien Guinot, George Fazekas, Elio Quinton, Emmanouil Benetos, Johan Pauwels</p>
<p>Abstract: Downstream probing has been the dominant method for evaluating model representations, an important process given the increasing prominence of self-supervised learning and foundation models. However, downstream probing primarily assesses the availability of task-relevant information in the model's latent space, overlooking attributes such as equivariance, invariance, and disentanglement, which contribute to the interpretability, adaptability, and utility of representations in real-world applications. While some attempts have been made to measure these qualities in representations, no unified evaluation framework with modular, generalizable, and interpretable metrics exists.
  In this paper, we argue for the importance of representation evaluation beyond downstream probing. We introduce a standardized protocol to quantify informativeness, equivariance, invariance, and disentanglement of factors of variation in model representations. We use it to evaluate representations from a variety of models in the image and speech domains using different architectures and pretraining approaches on identified controllable factors of variation. We find that representations from models with similar downstream performance can behave substantially differently with regard to these attributes. This hints that the respective mechanisms underlying their downstream performance are functionally different, prompting new research directions to understand and improve representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constructive neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has attracted growing research attention due to its ability to solve complex routing problems without relying on handcrafted rules. However, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in generalizing to large-scale problems due to high computational complexity and inefficient capture of structural patterns. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning-based search space reduction method that adaptively selects a small set of promising candidate nodes at each step of the constructive NCO process. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed heuristics, our selection model dynamically prioritizes nodes based on learned patterns, significantly reducing the search space while maintaining solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained solely on 100-node instances from uniform distribution, generalizes remarkably well to large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) instances with up to 1 million nodes from the uniform distribution and over 80K nodes from other distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Zhang (ETHOS Lab, EPFL-ENAC-IIC), Andrew Sonta (ETHOS Lab, EPFL-ENAC-IIC)</p>
<p>Abstract: Buildings account for a significant share of global energy consumption and emissions, making it critical to operate them efficiently. As electricity grids become more volatile with renewable penetration, buildings must provide flexibility to support grid stability. Building automation plays a key role in enhancing efficiency and flexibility via centralized operations, but it must prioritize occupant-centric strategies to balance energy and comfort targets. However, incorporating occupant information into large-scale, centralized building operations remains challenging due to data limitations. We investigate the potential of using whole-building smart meter data to infer both occupancy and system operations. Integrating these insights into data-driven building energy analysis allows more occupant-centric energy-saving and flexibility at scale. Specifically, we propose OccuEMBED, a unified framework for occupancy inference and system-level load analysis. It combines two key components: a probabilistic occupancy profile generator, and a controllable and interpretable load disaggregator supported by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). This design embeds knowledge of occupancy patterns and load-occupancy-weather relationships into deep learning models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations to demonstrate its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets compared to various occupancy inference baselines. OccuEMBED always achieved average F1 scores above 0.8 in discrete occupancy inference and RMSE within 0.1-0.2 for continuous occupancy ratios. We further demonstrate how OccuEMBED integrates with building load monitoring platforms to display occupancy profiles, analyze system-level operations, and inform occupant-responsive strategies. Our model lays a robust foundation in scaling occupant-centric building management systems to meet the challenges of an evolving energy system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Finn Gueterbock, Raul Santos-Rodriguez, Jeffrey N. Clark</p>
<p>Abstract: Air pollution is a significant global health risk, contributing to millions of premature deaths annually. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a harmful pollutant, disproportionately affects urban areas where monitoring networks are often sparse. We propose a novel method for predicting NO2 concentrations at unmonitored locations using transfer learning with satellite and meteorological data. Leveraging the GraphSAGE framework, our approach integrates autoregression and transfer learning to enhance predictive accuracy in data-scarce regions like Bristol. Pre-trained on data from London, UK, our model achieves a 8.6% reduction in Normalised Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) and a 32.6% reduction in Gradient RMSE compared to a baseline model. This work demonstrates the potential of virtual sensors for cost-effective air quality monitoring, contributing to actionable insights for climate and health interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Arauzo-Azofra, Jose Molina-Baena, Maria Luque-Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: The circadian rhythm plays a crucial role in regulating biological processes, and its disruption is linked to various health issues. Identifying small molecules that influence the circadian period is essential for developing targeted therapies. This study explores the use of evolutionary optimization techniques to enhance the classification of these molecules. We applied an evolutionary algorithm to optimize feature selection and classification performance. Several machine learning classifiers were employed, and performance was evaluated using accuracy and generalization ability. The findings demonstrate that the proposed evolutionary optimization method improves classification accuracy and reduces overfitting compared to baseline models. Additionally, the use of variance in accuracy as a penalty factor may enhance the model's reliability for real-world applications. Our study confirms that evolutionary optimization is an effective strategy for classifying small molecules regulating the circadian rhythm. The proposed approach not only improves predictive performance but also ensures a more robust model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Kiggundu, Dennis Krummacker, Hans D. Schotten</p>
<p>Abstract: To improve business efficiency and minimize costs, Artificial Intelligence (AI) practitioners have adopted a shift from formulating models from scratch towards sharing pretrained models. The pretrained models are then aggregated into a global model with higher generalization capabilities, which is afterwards distributed to the client devices. This approach is known as federated learning and inherently utilizes different techniques to select the candidate client models averaged to obtain the global model. This approach, in the case of communication systems, faces challenges arising from the existential diversity in device profiles. The multiplicity in profiles motivates our conceptual assessment of a metaheuristic algorithm (FedAvgen), which relates each pretrained model with its weight space as metadata, to a phenotype and genotype, respectively. This parent-child genetic evolution characterizes the global averaging step in federated learning. We then compare the results of our approach to two widely adopted baseline federated learning algorithms like Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Morando</p>
<p>Abstract: Processes of evidence accumulation for motor control contribute to the ecological validity of driver models. According to established theories of cognition, drivers make control adjustments when a process of accumulation of perceptual inputs reaches a decision boundary. Unfortunately, there is not a standard way for building such models, limiting their use. Current implementations are hand-crafted, lack adaptability, and rely on inefficient optimization techniques that do not scale well with large datasets. This paper introduces Akkumula, an evidence accumulation modelling framework built using deep learning techniques to leverage established coding libraries, gradient optimization, and large batch training. The core of the library is based on Spiking Neural Networks, whose operation mimic the evidence accumulation process in the biological brain. The model was tested on data collected during a test-track experiment. Results are promising. The model fits well the time course of vehicle control (brake, accelerate, steering) based on vehicle sensor data. The perceptual inputs are extracted by a dedicated neural network, increasing the context-awareness of the model in dynamic scenarios. Akkumula integrates with existing machine learning architectures, benefits from continuous advancements in deep learning, efficiently processes large datasets, adapts to diverse driving scenarios, and maintains a degree of transparency in its core mechanisms.</p>

To bridge this gap, we introduce DetoxAI, an open-source Python library for improving fairness in deep learning vision classifiers through post-hoc debiasing. DetoxAI implements state-of-the-art debiasing algorithms, fairness metrics, and visualization tools. It supports debiasing via interventions in internal representations and includes attribution-based visualization tools and quantitative algorithmic fairness metrics to show how bias is mitigated. This paper presents the motivation, design, and use cases of DetoxAI, demonstrating its tangible value to engineers and researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avanija Menon, Ovidiu Serban</p>
<p>Abstract: The European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) requires companies to prove their products do not contribute to deforestation, creating a critical demand for precise, asset-level environmental impact data. Current databases lack the necessary detail, relying heavily on broad financial metrics and manual data collection, which limits regulatory compliance and accurate environmental modeling. This study presents an automated, end-to-end data extraction pipeline that uses LLMs to create, clean, and validate structured databases, specifically targeting sectors with a high risk of deforestation. The pipeline introduces Instructional, Role-Based, Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (IRZ-CoT) prompting to enhance data extraction accuracy and a Retrieval-Augmented Validation (RAV) process that integrates real-time web searches for improved data reliability. Applied to SEC EDGAR filings in the Mining, Oil & Gas, and Utilities sectors, the pipeline demonstrates significant improvements over traditional zero-shot prompting approaches, particularly in extraction accuracy and validation coverage. This work advances NLP-driven automation for regulatory compliance, CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), and ESG, with broad sectoral applicability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta) is a recent paradigm for generating neural networks of varying width and depth. Based on Implicit Neural Representation (INR), NeuMeta learns a continuous weight manifold, enabling the direct generation of compressed models, including those with configurations not seen during training. While promising, the original formulation of NeuMeta proves effective only for the final layers of the undelying model, limiting its broader applicability. In this work, we propose a training algorithm that extends the capabilities of NeuMeta to enable full-network metamorphosis with minimal accuracy degradation. Our approach follows a structured recipe comprising block-wise incremental training, INR initialization, and strategies for replacing batch normalization. The resulting metamorphic networks maintain competitive accuracy across a wide range of compression ratios, offering a scalable solution for adaptable and efficient deployment of deep models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanghui Song, Aoqi Li, Lilei Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to analyze the economic performance of various parks under different conditions, particularly focusing on the operational costs and power load balancing before and after the deployment of energy storage systems. Firstly, the economic performance of the parks without energy storage was analyzed using a random forest model. Taking Park A as an example, it was found that the cost had the greatest correlation with electricity purchase, followed by photovoltaic output, indicating that solar and wind power output are key factors affecting economic performance. Subsequently, the operation of the parks after the configuration of a 50kW/100kWh energy storage system was simulated, and the total cost and operation strategy of the energy storage system were calculated. The results showed that after the deployment of energy storage, the amount of wind and solar power curtailment in each park decreased, and the operational costs were reduced. Finally, a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the energy storage configuration of each park. The energy storage operation strategy was optimized through fitness functions, crossover operations, and mutation operations. After optimization, the economic indicators of Parks A, B, and C all improved. The research results indicate that by optimizing energy storage configuration, each park can reduce costs, enhance economic benefits, and achieve sustainable development of the power system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zinan Liu, Haoran Li, Jingyi Lu, Gaoyuan Ma, Xu Hong, Giovanni Iacca, Arvind Kumar, Shaojun Tang, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous AI is no longer a hard-to-reach concept, it enables the agents to move beyond executing tasks to independently addressing complex problems, adapting to change while handling the uncertainty of the environment. However, what makes the agents truly autonomous? It is agentic reasoning, that is crucial for foundation models to develop symbolic logic, statistical correlations, or large-scale pattern recognition to process information, draw inferences, and make decisions. However, it remains unclear why and how existing agentic reasoning approaches work, in comparison to biological reasoning, which instead is deeply rooted in neural mechanisms involving hierarchical cognition, multimodal integration, and dynamic interactions. In this work, we propose a novel neuroscience-inspired framework for agentic reasoning. Grounded in three neuroscience-based definitions and supported by mathematical and biological foundations, we propose a unified framework modeling reasoning from perception to action, encompassing four core types, perceptual, dimensional, logical, and interactive, inspired by distinct functional roles observed in the human brain. We apply this framework to systematically classify and analyze existing AI reasoning methods, evaluating their theoretical foundations, computational designs, and practical limitations. We also explore its implications for building more generalizable, cognitively aligned agents in physical and virtual environments. Finally, building on our framework, we outline future directions and propose new neural-inspired reasoning methods, analogous to chain-of-thought prompting. By bridging cognitive neuroscience and AI, this work offers a theoretical foundation and practical roadmap for advancing agentic reasoning in intelligent systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyi Chen, Yunchao Yao, Yufei Ye, Zhixuan Xu, Homanga Bharadhwaj, Jiashun Wang, Shubham Tulsiani, Zackory Erickson, Jeffrey Ichnowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Functional grasp is essential for enabling dexterous multi-finger robot hands to manipulate objects effectively. However, most prior work either focuses on power grasping, which simply involves holding an object still, or relies on costly teleoperated robot demonstrations to teach robots how to grasp each object functionally. Instead, we propose extracting human grasp information from web images since they depict natural and functional object interactions, thereby bypassing the need for curated demonstrations. We reconstruct human hand-object interaction (HOI) 3D meshes from RGB images, retarget the human hand to multi-finger robot hands, and align the noisy object mesh with its accurate 3D shape. We show that these relatively low-quality HOI data from inexpensive web sources can effectively train a functional grasping model. To further expand the grasp dataset for seen and unseen objects, we use the initially-trained grasping policy with web data in the IsaacGym simulator to generate physically feasible grasps while preserving functionality. We train the grasping model on 10 object categories and evaluate it on 9 unseen objects, including challenging items such as syringes, pens, spray bottles, and tongs, which are underrepresented in existing datasets. The model trained on the web HOI dataset, achieving a 75.8% success rate on seen objects and 61.8% across all objects in simulation, with a 6.7% improvement in success rate and a 1.8x increase in functionality ratings over baselines. Simulator-augmented data further boosts performance from 61.8% to 83.4%. The sim-to-real transfer to the LEAP Hand achieves a 85% success rate. Project website is at: https://webgrasp.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanxun Huang, Sarah Erfani, Yige Li, Xingjun Ma, James Bailey</p>
<p>Abstract: As Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are increasingly adopted for diverse downstream tasks and integrated into large vision-language models (VLMs), their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations has emerged as a critical concern. In this work, we introduce \textbf{X-Transfer}, a novel attack method that exposes a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP. X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of deceiving various CLIP encoders and downstream VLMs across different samples, tasks, and domains. We refer to this property as \textbf{super transferability}--a single perturbation achieving cross-data, cross-domain, cross-model, and cross-task adversarial transferability simultaneously. This is achieved through \textbf{surrogate scaling}, a key innovation of our approach. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed surrogate models, which are computationally intensive to scale, X-Transfer employs an efficient surrogate scaling strategy that dynamically selects a small subset of suitable surrogates from a large search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that X-Transfer significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art UAP methods, establishing a new benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/HanxunH/XTransferBench}{GitHub repository}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models represent an important step toward general-purpose robotic systems by integrating visual perception, language understanding, and action execution. However, systematic evaluation of these models, particularly their zero-shot generalization capabilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, remains limited.

Our analysis reveals several critical insights: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant limitations in zero-shot generalization to OOD tasks, with performance heavily influenced by factors such as action representation and task complexit; (2) VLAs generally outperform other models due to their robust architectural design; and (3) VLM variants demonstrate substantial improvements when constrained appropriately, highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to precise prompt engineering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modular, Jacobi, and mock-modular forms serve as generating functions for BPS black hole degeneracies. By training feed-forward neural networks on Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms derived from the Dedekind eta function, Eisenstein series, and Jacobi theta functions, we demonstrate that machine learning techniques can accurately predict modular weights from truncated expansions. Our results reveal strong performance for negative weight modular and quasi-modular forms, particularly those arising in exact black hole counting formulae, with lower accuracy for positive weights and more complicated combinations of Jacobi theta functions. This study establishes a proof of concept for using machine learning to identify how data is organized in terms of modular symmetries in gravitational systems and suggests a pathway toward automated detection and verification of symmetries in quantum gravity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Salah Bouafif, Mohammad Hamdaqa, Edward Zulkoski</p>
<p>Abstract: Mutation testing is a widely recognized technique for assessing and enhancing the effectiveness of software test suites by introducing deliberate code mutations. However, its application often results in overly large test suites, as developers generate numerous tests to kill specific mutants, increasing computational overhead. This paper introduces PRIMG (Prioritization and Refinement Integrated Mutation-driven Generation), a novel framework for incremental and adaptive test case generation for Solidity smart contracts. PRIMG integrates two core components: a mutation prioritization module, which employs a machine learning model trained on mutant subsumption graphs to predict the usefulness of surviving mutants, and a test case generation module, which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and iteratively refine test cases to achieve syntactic and behavioral correctness.
  We evaluated PRIMG on real-world Solidity projects from Code4Arena to assess its effectiveness in improving mutation scores and generating high-quality test cases. The experimental results demonstrate that PRIMG significantly reduces test suite size while maintaining high mutation coverage. The prioritization module consistently outperformed random mutant selection, enabling the generation of high-impact tests with reduced computational effort. Furthermore, the refining process enhanced the correctness and utility of LLM-generated tests, addressing their inherent limitations in handling edge cases and complex program logic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reactive dance generation (RDG) produces follower movements conditioned on guiding dancer and music while ensuring spatial coordination and temporal coherence. However, existing methods overemphasize global constraints and optimization, overlooking local information, such as fine-grained spatial interactions and localized temporal context. Therefore, we present ReactDance, a novel diffusion-based framework for high-fidelity RDG with long-term coherence and multi-scale controllability. Unlike existing methods that struggle with interaction fidelity, synchronization, and temporal consistency in duet synthesis, our approach introduces two key innovations: 1)Group Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (GRFSQ), a multi-scale disentangled motion representation that captures interaction semantics from coarse body rhythms to fine-grained joint dynamics, and 2)Blockwise Local Context (BLC), a sampling strategy eliminating error accumulation in long sequence generation via local block causal masking and periodic positional encoding. Built on the decoupled multi-scale GRFSQ representation, we implement a diffusion model withLayer-Decoupled Classifier-free Guidance (LDCFG), allowing granular control over motion semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ReactDance surpasses existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing broadly generalizable visual navigation policies for robots is a significant challenge, primarily constrained by the availability of large-scale, diverse training data. While curated datasets collected by researchers offer high quality, their limited size restricts policy generalization. To overcome this, we explore leveraging abundant, passively collected data sources, including large volumes of crowd-sourced teleoperation data and unlabeled YouTube videos, despite their potential for lower quality or missing action labels. We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework that utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or generate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data is then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on visual goals or GPS waypoints. We demonstrate that LogoNav, trained using MBRA-processed data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust navigation over distances exceeding 300 meters in previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. Our extensive real-world evaluations, conducted across a fleet of robots (including quadrupeds) in six cities on three continents, validate the policy's ability to generalize and navigate effectively even amidst pedestrians in crowded settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Guo, Yuda Wang, Zeqiao Huang, Changjiang Zhang, Shumin ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In the complex landscape of traditional futures trading, where vast data and variables like real-time Limit Order Books (LOB) complicate price predictions, we introduce the FutureQuant Transformer model, leveraging attention mechanisms to navigate these challenges. Unlike conventional models focused on point predictions, the FutureQuant model excels in forecasting the range and volatility of future prices, thus offering richer insights for trading strategies. Its ability to parse and learn from intricate market patterns allows for enhanced decision-making, significantly improving risk management and achieving a notable average gain of 0.1193% per 30-minute trade over state-of-the-art models with a simple algorithm using factors such as RSI, ATR, and Bollinger Bands. This innovation marks a substantial leap forward in predictive analytics within the volatile domain of futures trading.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Gon\c{c}alves, Miguel Silva, Eva Maia, Isabel Pra\c{c}a</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of Artificial Intelligence has become a powerful approach to detecting software vulnerabilities. However, effective vulnerability detection relies on accurately capturing the semantic structure of code and its contextual relationships. Given that the same functionality can be implemented in various forms, a preprocessing tool that standardizes code representation is important. This tool must be efficient, adaptable across programming languages, and capable of supporting new transformations. To address this challenge, we build on the existing SCoPE framework and introduce SCoPE2, an enhanced version with improved performance. We compare both versions in terms of processing time and memory usage and evaluate their impact on a Large Language Model (LLM) for vulnerability detection. Our results show a 97.3\% reduction in processing time with SCoPE2, along with an improved F1-score for the LLM, solely due to the refined preprocessing approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Wang, Yining Pan, Minghao Zhou, Zijia Tang, Yanfei Wang, Guangyu Wang, Qianqian Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Drug resistance presents a major challenge in cancer therapy. Single cell profiling offers insights into cellular heterogeneity, yet the application of large-scale foundation models for predicting drug response in single cell data remains underexplored. To address this, we developed scDrugMap, an integrated framework featuring both a Python command-line interface and a web server for drug response prediction. scDrugMap evaluates a wide range of foundation models, including eight single-cell models and two large language models, using a curated dataset of over 326,000 cells in the primary collection and 18,800 cells in the validation set, spanning 36 datasets and diverse tissue and cancer types. We benchmarked model performance under pooled-data and cross-data evaluation settings, employing both layer freezing and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning strategies. In the pooled-data scenario, scFoundation achieved the best performance, with mean F1 scores of 0.971 (layer freezing) and 0.947 (fine-tuning), outperforming the lowest-performing model by over 50%. In the cross-data setting, UCE excelled post fine-tuning (mean F1: 0.774), while scGPT led in zero-shot learning (mean F1: 0.858). Overall, scDrugMap provides the first large-scale benchmark of foundation models for drug response prediction in single-cell data and serves as a user-friendly, flexible platform for advancing drug discovery and translational research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Achraf Azize, Yulian Wu, Junya Honda, Francesco Orabona, Shinji Ito, Debabrota Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: As sequential learning algorithms are increasingly applied to real life, ensuring data privacy while maintaining their utilities emerges as a timely question. In this context, regret minimisation in stochastic bandits under $\epsilon$-global Differential Privacy (DP) has been widely studied. Unlike bandits without DP, there is a significant gap between the best-known regret lower and upper bound in this setting, though they "match" in order. Thus, we revisit the regret lower and upper bounds of $\epsilon$-global DP algorithms for Bernoulli bandits and improve both. First, we prove a tighter regret lower bound involving a novel information-theoretic quantity characterising the hardness of $\epsilon$-global DP in stochastic bandits. Our lower bound strictly improves on the existing ones across all $\epsilon$ values. Then, we choose two asymptotically optimal bandit algorithms, i.e. DP-KLUCB and DP-IMED, and propose their DP versions using a unified blueprint, i.e., (a) running in arm-dependent phases, and (b) adding Laplace noise to achieve privacy. For Bernoulli bandits, we analyse the regrets of these algorithms and show that their regrets asymptotically match our lower bound up to a constant arbitrary close to 1. This refutes the conjecture that forgetting past rewards is necessary to design optimal bandit algorithms under global DP. At the core of our algorithms lies a new concentration inequality for sums of Bernoulli variables under Laplace mechanism, which is a new DP version of the Chernoff bound. This result is universally useful as the DP literature commonly treats the concentrations of Laplace noise and random variables separately, while we couple them to yield a tighter bound.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Di Fruscia, Jana Marie Weber</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting enzymatic reactions is crucial for applications in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and drug discovery, yet it remains a complex and resource-intensive task. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in various scientific domains, e.g., through their ability to generalize knowledge, reason over complex structures, and leverage in-context learning strategies. In this study, we systematically evaluate the capability of LLMs, particularly the Llama-3.1 family (8B and 70B), across three core biochemical tasks: Enzyme Commission number prediction, forward synthesis, and retrosynthesis. We compare single-task and multitask learning strategies, employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA adapters. Additionally, we assess performance across different data regimes to explore their adaptability in low-data settings. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs capture biochemical knowledge, with multitask learning enhancing forward- and retrosynthesis predictions by leveraging shared enzymatic information. We also identify key limitations, for example challenges in hierarchical EC classification schemes, highlighting areas for further improvement in LLM-driven biochemical modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kalyan Nakka, Jimmy Dani, Ausmit Mondal, Nitesh Saxena</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has influenced the development of their lighter counterparts-Small Language Models (SLMs)-to enable on-device deployment across smartphones and edge devices. These SLMs offer enhanced privacy, reduced latency, server-free functionality, and improved user experience. However, due to resource constraints of on-device environment, SLMs undergo size optimization through compression techniques like quantization, which can inadvertently introduce fairness, ethical and privacy risks. Critically, quantized SLMs may respond to harmful queries directly, without requiring adversarial manipulation, raising significant safety and trust concerns.
  To address this, we propose LiteLMGuard (LLMG), an on-device prompt guard that provides real-time, prompt-level defense for quantized SLMs. Additionally, our prompt guard is designed to be model-agnostic such that it can be seamlessly integrated with any SLM, operating independently of underlying architectures. Our LLMG formalizes prompt filtering as a deep learning (DL)-based prompt answerability classification task, leveraging semantic understanding to determine whether a query should be answered by any SLM. Using our curated dataset, Answerable-or-Not, we trained and fine-tuned several DL models and selected ELECTRA as the candidate, with 97.75% answerability classification accuracy.
  Our safety effectiveness evaluations demonstrate that LLMG defends against over 87% of harmful prompts, including both direct instruction and jailbreak attack strategies. We further showcase its ability to mitigate the Open Knowledge Attacks, where compromised SLMs provide unsafe responses without adversarial prompting. In terms of prompt filtering effectiveness, LLMG achieves near state-of-the-art filtering accuracy of 94%, with an average latency of 135 ms, incurring negligible overhead for users.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we train a transformer using differential privacy (DP) for language modeling in SwiftKey. We run multiple experiments to balance the trade-off between the model size, run-time speed and accuracy. We show that we get small and consistent gains in the next-word-prediction and accuracy with graceful increase in memory and speed compared to the production GRU. This is obtained by scaling down a GPT2 architecture to fit the required size and a two stage training process that builds a seed model on general data and DP finetunes it on typing data. The transformer is integrated using ONNX offering both flexibility and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongweiyang Xu, Xulin Fan, Zhong-Qiu Wang, Xilin Jiang, Romit Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR.

<p>Abstract: EfficientNet models are convolutional neural networks optimized for parameter allocation by jointly balancing network width, depth, and resolution. Renowned for their exceptional accuracy, these models have become a standard for image classification tasks across diverse computer vision benchmarks. While traditional neural networks learn correlations between feature channels during training, vector-valued neural networks inherently treat multidimensional data as coherent entities, taking for granted the inter-channel relationships. This paper introduces vector-valued EfficientNets (V-EfficientNets), a novel extension of EfficientNet designed to process arbitrary vector-valued data. The proposed models are evaluated on a medical image classification task, achieving an average accuracy of 99.46% on the ALL-IDB2 dataset for detecting acute lymphoblastic leukemia. V-EfficientNets demonstrate remarkable efficiency, significantly reducing parameters while outperforming state-of-the-art models, including the original EfficientNet.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wu, Jie Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph completion (KGC) has obtained significant attention due to its practical applications in real-world scenarios, where new knowledge often emerges with limited available data. While most existing methods for few-shot KGC have predominantly focused on leveraging relational information, rich semantics inherent in KGs have been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a novel prompted meta-learning (PromptMeta) framework that seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot KGC. PrompMeta has two key innovations: (1) a meta-semantic prompt pool that captures and consolidates high-level meta-semantics, enabling effective knowledge transfer and adaptation to rare and newly emerging relations. (2) a learnable fusion prompt that dynamically combines meta-semantic information with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks. Both components are optimized together with model parameters within a meta-learning framework. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuyao Chen, Yuexi Du, Tal Zeevi, Nicha C. Dvornek, John A. Onofrey</p>
<p>Abstract: Histopathology evaluation of tissue specimens through microscopic examination is essential for accurate disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, traditional manual analysis by specially trained pathologists is time-consuming, labor-intensive, cost-inefficient, and prone to inter-rater variability, potentially affecting diagnostic consistency and accuracy. As digital pathology images continue to proliferate, there is a pressing need for automated analysis to address these challenges. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence-based tools such as machine learning (ML) models, have significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of analyzing histopathological slides. However, despite their impressive performance, ML models are invariant only to translation, lacking invariance to rotation and reflection. This limitation restricts their ability to generalize effectively, particularly in histopathology, where images intrinsically lack meaningful orientation. In this study, we develop robust, equivariant histopathological biomarkers through a novel symmetric convolutional kernel via unsupervised segmentation. The approach is validated using prostate tissue micro-array (TMA) images from 50 patients in the Gleason 2019 Challenge public dataset. The biomarkers extracted through this approach demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalizability against rotation compared to models using standard convolution kernels, holding promise for enhancing the accuracy, consistency, and robustness of ML models in digital pathology. Ultimately, this work aims to improve diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of histopathology beyond prostate cancer through equivariant imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: The motion planning problem involves finding a collision-free path from a robot's starting to its target configuration. Recently, self-supervised learning methods have emerged to tackle motion planning problems without requiring expensive expert demonstrations. They solve the Eikonal equation for training neural networks and lead to efficient solutions. However, these methods struggle in complex environments because they fail to maintain key properties of the Eikonal equation, such as optimal value functions and geodesic distances. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised temporal difference metric learning approach that solves the Eikonal equation more accurately and enhances performance in solving complex and unseen planning tasks. Our method enforces Bellman's principle of optimality over finite regions, using temporal difference learning to avoid spurious local minima while incorporating metric learning to preserve the Eikonal equation's essential geodesic properties. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods in handling complex environments and generalizing to unseen environments, with robot configurations ranging from 2 to 12 degrees of freedom (DOF).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ohida Binte Amin, Varun Mishra, Tinashe M. Tapera, Robert Volpe, Aarti Sathyanarayana</p>
<p>Abstract: Wearable sensors are widely used to collect physiological data and develop stress detection models. However, most studies focus on a single dataset, rarely evaluating model reproducibility across devices, populations, or study conditions. We previously assessed the reproducibility of stress detection models across multiple studies, testing models trained on one dataset against others using heart rate (with R-R interval) and electrodermal activity (EDA). In this study, we extended our stress detection reproducibility to consumer wearable sensors. We compared validated research-grade devices, to consumer wearables - Biopac MP160, Polar H10, Empatica E4, to the Garmin Forerunner 55s, assessing device-specific stress detection performance by conducting a new stress study on undergraduate students. Thirty-five students completed three standardized stress-induction tasks in a lab setting. Biopac MP160 performed the best, being consistent with our expectations of it as the gold standard, though performance varied across devices and models. Combining heart rate variability (HRV) and EDA enhanced stress prediction across most scenarios. However, Empatica E4 showed variability; while HRV and EDA improved stress detection in leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) evaluations (AUROC up to 0.953), device-specific limitations led to underperformance when tested with our pre-trained stress detection tool (AUROC 0.723), highlighting generalizability challenges related to hardware-model compatibility. Garmin Forerunner 55s demonstrated strong potential for real-world stress monitoring, achieving the best mental arithmetic stress detection performance in LOSO (AUROC up to 0.961) comparable to research-grade devices like Polar H10 (AUROC 0.954), and Empatica E4 (AUROC 0.905 with HRV-only model and AUROC 0.953 with HRV+EDA model), with the added advantage of consumer-friendly wearability for free-living contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongchan Park, Mingyu Park, Donghwan Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy from a static dataset without further interactions with the environment. Collecting sufficiently large datasets for offline RL is exhausting since this data collection requires colossus interactions with environments and becomes tricky when the interaction with the environment is restricted. Hence, how an agent learns the best policy with a minimal static dataset is a crucial issue in offline RL, similar to the sample efficiency problem in online RL. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play pretraining method to initialize a feature of a $Q$-network to enhance data efficiency in offline RL. Specifically, we introduce a shared $Q$-network structure that outputs predictions of the next state and $Q$-value. We pretrain the shared $Q$-network through a supervised regression task that predicts a next state and trains the shared $Q$-network using diverse offline RL methods. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing popular offline RL methods on the D4RL, Robomimic and V-D4RL benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our method significantly boosts data-efficient offline RL across various data qualities and data distributions trough D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks. Notably, our method adapted with only 10% of the dataset outperforms standard algorithms even with full datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training is one of the most demanding distributed computations today, often requiring thousands of GPUs with frequent synchronization across machines. Such a workload pattern makes it susceptible to stragglers, where the training can be stalled by few slow workers. At ByteDance we find stragglers are not trivially always caused by hardware failures, but can arise from multiple complex factors. This work aims to present a comprehensive study on the straggler issues in LLM training, using a five-month trace collected from our ByteDance LLM training cluster. The core methodology is what-if analysis that simulates the scenario without any stragglers and contrasts with the actual case. We use this method to study the following questions: (1) how often do stragglers affect training jobs, and what effect do they have on job performance; (2) do stragglers exhibit temporal or spatial patterns; and (3) what are the potential root causes for stragglers?</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Da Wu, Zhanliang Wang, Quan Nguyen, Zhuoran Xu, Kai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality multimodal biomedical data limits the ability to effectively fine-tune pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized biomedical tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce MINT (Multimodal Integrated kNowledge Transfer), a framework that aligns unimodal large decoder models with domain-specific decision patterns from multimodal biomedical data through preference optimization. While MINT supports different optimization techniques, we primarily implement it with the Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) framework as its backbone. This strategy enables the aligned LLMs to perform predictive tasks using text-only or image-only inputs while retaining knowledge learnt from multimodal data. MINT leverages an upstream multimodal machine learning (MML) model trained on high-quality multimodal data to transfer domain-specific insights to downstream text-only or image-only LLMs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two key applications: (1) Rare genetic disease prediction from texts, where MINT uses a multimodal encoder model, trained on facial photos and clinical notes, to generate a preference dataset for aligning a lightweight Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct. Despite relying on text input only, the MINT-derived model outperforms models trained with SFT, RAG, or DPO, and even outperforms Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct. (2) Tissue type classification using cell nucleus images, where MINT uses a vision-language foundation model as the preference generator, containing knowledge learnt from both text and histopathological images to align downstream image-only models. The resulting MINT-derived model significantly improves the performance of Llama 3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct on tissue type classification. In summary, MINT provides an effective strategy to align unimodal LLMs with high-quality multimodal expertise through preference optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automation can play a prominent role in improving efficiency, accuracy, and scalability in infrastructure surveying and assessing construction and compliance standards. This paper presents a framework for automation of geometric measurements and compliance assessment using point cloud data. The proposed approach integrates deep learning-based detection and segmentation, in conjunction with geometric and signal processing techniques, to automate surveying tasks. As a proof of concept, we apply this framework to automatically evaluate the compliance of curb ramps with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), demonstrating the utility of point cloud data in survey automation. The method leverages a newly collected, large annotated dataset of curb ramps, made publicly available as part of this work, to facilitate robust model training and evaluation. Experimental results, including comparison with manual field measurements of several ramps, validate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to significantly reduce manual effort and improve consistency in infrastructure assessment. Beyond ADA compliance, the proposed framework lays the groundwork for broader applications in infrastructure surveying and automated construction evaluation, promoting wider adoption of point cloud data in these domains.

In this work, we focus on the axis of embodiment and investigate embodiment scaling laws$\unicode{x2013}$the hypothesis that increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones. Using robot locomotion as a test bed, we procedurally generate a dataset of $\sim$1,000 varied embodiments, spanning humanoids, quadrupeds, and hexapods, and train generalist policies capable of handling diverse observation and action spaces on random subsets. We find that increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones, and scaling embodiments is more effective in enabling embodiment-level generalization than scaling data on small, fixed sets of embodiments. Notably, our best policy, trained on the full dataset, zero-shot transfers to novel embodiments in the real world, such as Unitree Go2 and H1. These results represent a step toward general embodied intelligence, with potential relevance to adaptive control for configurable robots, co-design of morphology and control, and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruvesh Patel, Aishwarya Sahoo, Avinash Amballa, Tahira Naseem, Tim G. J. Rudner, Andrew McCallum</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs), which predict subsequent tokens one-by-one ``from left to right,'' have achieved significant success across a wide range of sequence generation tasks. However, they struggle to accurately represent sequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential dependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking multiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs cannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be filled in is not known in advance. In this work, we introduce Insertion Language Models (ILMs), which learn to insert tokens at arbitrary positions in a sequence -- that is, they select jointly both the position and the vocabulary element to be inserted. By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent strong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in arbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token dependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs, we propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising objective. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that ILMs outperform both ARMs and MDMs on common planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that ILMs outperform MDMs and perform on par with ARMs in an unconditional text generation task while offering greater flexibility than MDMs in arbitrary-length text infilling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehao Fan, Garrett Gagnon, Zhenyu Liu, Liu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models are the foundation of modern machine learning, but their execution, particularly during autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs), places significant pressure on memory systems due to frequent memory accesses and growing key-value (KV) caches. This creates a bottleneck in memory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth and compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily optimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access patterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they suffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization. In this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme tailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC clusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory regions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve relevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed centroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without frequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM system show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces attention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a KV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and 45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval. Meanwhile, STARC maintains model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art sparse attention methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and hardware-friendly long-context LLM inference on PIM architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Chen, Keyi Li, Yifan Jia, Le Ye, Yufei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, thanks for their exceptional generative capabilities and scalability. Nonetheless, the iterative nature of diffusion models (DMs) results in high computation complexity, posing challenges for deployment. Although existing cache-based acceleration methods try to utilize the inherent temporal similarity to skip redundant computations of DiT, the lack of correction may induce potential quality degradation. In this paper, we propose increment-calibrated caching, a training-free method for DiT acceleration, where the calibration parameters are generated from the pre-trained model itself with low-rank approximation. To deal with the possible correction failure arising from outlier activations, we introduce channel-aware Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which further strengthens the calibration effect. Experimental results show that our method always achieve better performance than existing naive caching methods with a similar computation resource budget. When compared with 35-step DDIM, our method eliminates more than 45% computation and improves IS by 12 at the cost of less than 0.06 FID increase.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Xin, Jianfeng Lu, Shuqin Cao, Gang Li, Haozhao Wang, Guanghui Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Online Federated Learning (OFL) is a real-time learning paradigm that sequentially executes parameter aggregation immediately for each random arriving client. To motivate clients to participate in OFL, it is crucial to offer appropriate incentives to offset the training resource consumption. However, the design of incentive mechanisms in OFL is constrained by the dynamic variability of Two-sided Incomplete Information (TII) concerning resources, where the server is unaware of the clients' dynamically changing computational resources, while clients lack knowledge of the real-time communication resources allocated by the server. To incentivize clients to participate in training by offering dynamic rewards to each arriving client, we design a novel Dynamic Bayesian persuasion pricing for online Federated learning (DaringFed) under TII. Specifically, we begin by formulating the interaction between the server and clients as a dynamic signaling and pricing allocation problem within a Bayesian persuasion game, and then demonstrate the existence of a unique Bayesian persuasion Nash equilibrium. By deriving the optimal design of DaringFed under one-sided incomplete information, we further analyze the approximate optimal design of DaringFed with a specific bound under TII. Finally, extensive evaluation conducted on real datasets demonstrate that DaringFed optimizes accuracy and converges speed by 16.99%, while experiments with synthetic datasets validate the convergence of estimate unknown values and the effectiveness of DaringFed in improving the server's utility by up to 12.6%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guohao Lin, Shidong Pan, Rasul Khanbayov, Changxi Yang, Ani Khaloian-Sarnaghi, Andriy Kovryga</p>
<p>Abstract: Knots in wood are critical to both aesthetics and structural integrity, making their detection and pairing essential in timber processing. However, traditional manual annotation was labor-intensive and inefficient, necessitating automation. This paper proposes a lightweight and fully automated pipeline for knot detection and pairing based on machine learning techniques. In the detection stage, high-resolution surface images of wooden boards were collected using industrial-grade cameras, and a large-scale dataset was manually annotated and preprocessed. After the transfer learning, the YOLOv8l achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.887. In the pairing stage, detected knots were analyzed and paired based on multidimensional feature extraction. A triplet neural network was used to map the features into a latent space, enabling clustering algorithms to identify and pair corresponding knots. The triplet network with learnable weights achieved a pairing accuracy of 0.85. Further analysis revealed that he distances from the knot's start and end points to the bottom of the wooden board, and the longitudinal coordinates play crucial roles in achieving high pairing accuracy. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, demonstrating the potential of AI in advancing wood science and industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Janik Kaden, Maximilian Hilger, Tim Schreiter, Marius Schaab, Thomas Graichen, Andrey Rudenko, Ulrich Heinkel, Achim J. Lilienthal</p>
<p>Abstract: With robots increasingly integrating into human environments, understanding and predicting human motion is essential for safe and efficient interactions. Modern human motion and activity prediction approaches require high quality and quantity of data for training and evaluation, usually collected from motion capture systems, onboard or stationary sensors. Setting up these systems is challenging due to the intricate setup of hardware components, extensive calibration procedures, occlusions, and substantial costs. These constraints make deploying such systems in new and large environments difficult and limit their usability for in-the-wild measurements. In this paper we investigate the possibility to apply the novel Ultra-Wideband (UWB) localization technology as a scalable alternative for human motion capture in crowded and occlusion-prone environments. We include additional sensing modalities such as eye-tracking, onboard robot LiDAR and radar sensors, and record motion capture data as ground truth for evaluation and comparison. The environment imitates a museum setup, with up to four active participants navigating toward random goals in a natural way, and offers more than 130 minutes of multi-modal data. Our investigation provides a step toward scalable and accurate motion data collection beyond vision-based systems, laying a foundation for evaluating sensing modalities like UWB in larger and complex environments like warehouses, airports, or convention centers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Split Learning (SL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed deep learning, allowing resource-constrained clients to offload portions of their model computation to servers while maintaining collaborative learning. However, recent research has demonstrated that SL remains vulnerable to a range of privacy and security threats, including information leakage, model inversion, and adversarial attacks. While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, a systematic understanding of the attack landscape and corresponding countermeasures is still lacking. In this study, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks and defenses in SL, categorizing them along three key dimensions: employed strategies, constraints, and effectiveness. Furthermore, we identify key open challenges and research gaps in SL based on our systematization, highlighting potential future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Lappe, Martin A. Giese</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has shown that the attention maps of the widely popular DINOv2 model exhibit artifacts, which hurt both model interpretability and performance on dense image tasks. These artifacts emerge due to the model repurposing patch tokens with redundant local information for the storage of global image information. To address this problem, additional register tokens have been incorporated in which the model can store such information instead. We carefully examine the influence of these register tokens on the relationship between global and local image features, showing that while register tokens yield cleaner attention maps, these maps do not accurately reflect the integration of local image information in large models. Instead, global information is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading to a disconnect between local and global features. Inspired by these findings, we show that the CLS token itself, which can be interpreted as a register, leads to a very similar phenomenon in models without explicit register tokens. Our work shows that care must be taken when interpreting attention maps of large ViTs. Further, by clearly attributing the faulty behaviour to register and CLS tokens, we show a path towards more interpretable vision models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghee Han, Soongyu Choi, Joo-Young Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Protein Structure Prediction Models (PPMs), such as AlphaFold2 and ESMFold, have revolutionized computational biology by achieving unprecedented accuracy in predicting three-dimensional protein folding structures. However, these models face significant scalability challenges, particularly when processing proteins with long amino acid sequences (e.g., sequence length > 1,000). The primary bottleneck that arises from the exponential growth in activation sizes is driven by the unique data structure in PPM, which introduces an additional dimension that leads to substantial memory and computational demands. These limitations have hindered the effective scaling of PPM for real-world applications, such as analyzing large proteins or complex multimers with critical biological and pharmaceutical relevance.
  In this paper, we present LightNobel, the first hardware-software co-designed accelerator developed to overcome scalability limitations on the sequence length in PPM. At the software level, we propose Token-wise Adaptive Activation Quantization (AAQ), which leverages unique token-wise characteristics, such as distogram patterns in PPM activations, to enable fine-grained quantization techniques without compromising accuracy. At the hardware level, LightNobel integrates the multi-precision reconfigurable matrix processing unit (RMPU) and versatile vector processing unit (VVPU) to enable the efficient execution of AAQ. Through these innovations, LightNobel achieves up to 8.44x, 8.41x speedup and 37.29x, 43.35x higher power efficiency over the latest NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs, respectively, while maintaining negligible accuracy loss. It also reduces the peak memory requirement up to 120.05x in PPM, enabling scalable processing for proteins with long sequences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity due to their remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation. However, despite their widespread deployment in inference services such as ChatGPT, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive user data have arisen. Existing solutions primarily rely on privacy-enhancing technologies to mitigate such risks, facing the trade-off among efficiency, privacy, and utility. To narrow this gap, we propose Cape, a context-aware prompt perturbation mechanism based on differential privacy, to enable efficient inference with an improved privacy-utility trade-off. Concretely, we introduce a hybrid utility function that better captures the token similarity. Additionally, we propose a bucketized sampling mechanism to handle large sampling space, which might lead to long-tail phenomenons. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, along with ablation studies, demonstrate that Cape achieves a better privacy-utility trade-off compared to prior state-of-the-art works.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modal methods for simulating vibrations of strings, membranes, and plates are widely used in acoustics and physically informed audio synthesis. However, traditional implementations, particularly for non-linear models like the von K\'arm\'an plate, are computationally demanding and lack differentiability, limiting inverse modelling and real-time applications. We introduce a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated modal framework built with the JAX library, providing efficient simulations and enabling gradient-based inverse modelling. Benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms CPU and GPU-based implementations, particularly for simulations with many modes. Inverse modelling experiments demonstrate that our approach can recover physical parameters, including tension, stiffness, and geometry, from both synthetic and experimental data. Although fitting physical parameters is more sensitive to initialisation compared to other methods, it provides greater interpretability and more compact parameterisation. The code is released as open source to support future research and applications in differentiable physical modelling and sound synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of ConvNeXt and its variants has reaffirmed the conceptual and structural suitability of CNN-based models for vision tasks, re-establishing them as key players in image classification in general, and in facial expression recognition (FER) in particular. In this paper, we propose a new set of models that build on these advancements by incorporating a new set of attention mechanisms that combines Triplet attention with Squeeze-and-Excitation (TripSE) in four different variants. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these variants by applying them to the ResNet18, DenseNet and ConvNext architectures to validate their versatility and impact. Our study shows that incorporating a TripSE block in these CNN models boosts their performances, particularly for the ConvNeXt architecture, indicating its utility. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms and associated models across four datasets, namely CIFAR100, ImageNet, FER2013 and AffectNet datasets, where ConvNext with TripSE achieves state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of \textbf{78.27\%} on the popular FER2013 dataset, a new feat for this dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyu Wang, Gilberto Berardinelli, Hei Victor Cheng, Petar Popovski, Ramoni Adeogun</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile users are prone to experience beam failure due to beam drifting in millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Sensing can help alleviate beam drifting with timely beam changes and low overhead since it does not need user feedback. This work studies the problem of optimizing sensing-aided communication by dynamically managing beams allocated to mobile users. A multi-beam scheme is introduced, which allocates multiple beams to the users that need an update on the angle of departure (AoD) estimates and a single beam to the users that have satisfied AoD estimation precision. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) assisted method is developed to optimize the beam allocation policy, relying only upon the sensing echoes. For comparison, a heuristic AoD-based method using approximated Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for allocation is also presented. Both methods require neither user feedback nor prior state evolution information. Results show that the DRL-assisted method achieves a considerable gain in throughput than the conventional beam sweeping method and the AoD-based method, and it is robust to different user speeds.</p>

<p>Abstract: While classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image classification, the emergence of quantum computing presents new opportunities for enhancing neural network architectures. Quantum CNNs (QCNNs) leverage quantum mechanical properties and hold potential to outperform classical approaches. However, their implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices remains challenging due to hardware limitations. In our research, we address this challenge by introducing an encoding scheme that significantly reduces the input dimensionality. We demonstrate that a primitive QCNN architecture with 49 qubits is sufficient to directly process $28\times 28$ pixel MNIST images, eliminating the need for classical dimensionality reduction pre-processing. Additionally, we propose an automated framework based on expressibility, entanglement, and complexity characteristics to identify the building blocks of QCNNs, parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Our approach demonstrates advantages in accuracy and convergence speed with a similar parameter count compared to both hybrid QCNNs and classical CNNs. We validated our experiments on IBM's Heron r2 quantum processor, achieving $96.08\%$ classification accuracy, surpassing the $71.74\%$ benchmark of traditional approaches under identical training conditions. These results represent one of the first implementations of image classifications on real quantum hardware and validate the potential of quantum computing in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongye Zheng, Yue Xing, Lipeng Zhu, Xu Han, Junliang Du, Wanyu Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: This study focuses on the problem of path modeling in heterogeneous information networks and proposes a multi-hop path-aware recommendation framework. The method centers on multi-hop paths composed of various types of entities and relations. It models user preferences through three stages: path selection, semantic representation, and attention-based fusion. In the path selection stage, a path filtering mechanism is introduced to remove redundant and noisy information. In the representation learning stage, a sequential modeling structure is used to jointly encode entities and relations, preserving the semantic dependencies within paths. In the fusion stage, an attention mechanism assigns different weights to each path to generate a global user interest representation. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets such as Amazon-Book show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing recommendation models across multiple evaluation metrics, including HR@10, Recall@10, and Precision@10. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-hop paths in capturing high-order interaction semantics and demonstrate the expressive modeling capabilities of the framework in heterogeneous recommendation scenarios. This method provides both theoretical and practical value by integrating structural information modeling in heterogeneous networks with recommendation algorithm design. It offers a more expressive and flexible paradigm for learning user preferences in complex data environments.</p>

To align the sparsification with human perception, we learn the masking in the space of semantically meaningful pixel regions rather than on pixel-level. Additionally, we introduce an explicit way to dynamically determine the required level of sparsity for each instance. We show empirically on semi-synthetic and natural image datasets that our inherently interpretable classifier produces more meaningful, human-understandable predictions than state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Unilogit, a novel self-distillation method for machine unlearning in Large Language Models. Unilogit addresses the challenge of selectively forgetting specific information while maintaining overall model utility, a critical task in compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR. Unlike prior methods that rely on static hyperparameters or starting model outputs, Unilogit dynamically adjusts target logits to achieve a uniform probability for the target token, leveraging the current model's outputs for more accurate self-distillation targets. This approach not only eliminates the need for additional hyperparameters but also enhances the model's ability to approximate the golden targets. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and an in-house e-commerce dataset demonstrate Unilogit's superior performance in balancing forget and retain objectives, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as NPO and UnDIAL. Our analysis further reveals Unilogit's robustness across various scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability and effectiveness in achieving efficacious machine unlearning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Combining natural language and geometric shapes is an emerging research area with multiple applications in robotics and language-assisted design. A crucial task in this domain is object referent identification, which involves selecting a 3D object given a textual description of the target. Variability in language descriptions and spatial relationships of 3D objects makes this a complex task, increasing the need to better understand the behavior of neural network models in this domain. However, limited research has been conducted in this area. Specifically, when a model makes an incorrect prediction despite being provided with a seemingly correct object description, practitioners are left wondering: "Why is the model wrong?". In this work, we present a method answering this question by generating counterfactual examples. Our method takes a misclassified sample, which includes two objects and a text description, and generates an alternative yet similar formulation that would have resulted in a correct prediction by the model. We have evaluated our approach with data from the ShapeTalk dataset along with three distinct models. Our counterfactual examples maintain the structure of the original description, are semantically similar and meaningful. They reveal weaknesses in the description, model bias and enhance the understanding of the models behavior. Theses insights help practitioners to better interact with systems as well as engineers to improve models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large deep-learning models for music, including those focused on learning general-purpose music audio representations, are often assumed to require substantial training data to achieve high performance. If true, this would pose challenges in scenarios where audio data or annotations are scarce, such as for underrepresented music traditions, non-popular genres, and personalized music creation and listening. Understanding how these models behave in limited-data scenarios could be crucial for developing techniques to tackle them.
  In this work, we investigate the behavior of several music audio representation models under limited-data learning regimes. We consider music models with various architectures, training paradigms, and input durations, and train them on data collections ranging from 5 to 8,000 minutes long. We evaluate the learned representations on various music information retrieval tasks and analyze their robustness to noise. We show that, under certain conditions, representations from limited-data and even random models perform comparably to ones from large-dataset models, though handcrafted features outperform all learned representations in some tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Harris, Fan Grayson, Felix Feldman, Timothy Laurence, Toby Nonnenmacher, Oliver Higgins, Leo Loman, Selina Patel, Thomas Finnie, Samuel Collins, Michael Borowitz</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, a detailed understanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for successful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health, where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form responses to public health queries, created via an automated pipeline. We also release a new dataset of the extracted UK Government public health guidance documents used as source text for PubHealthBench. Assessing 24 LLMs on PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% in the MCQA setup, and outperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Therefore, whilst there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate source of public health information, additional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingwen Bu, Yanting Yang, Jisong Cai, Shenyuan Gao, Guanghui Ren, Maoqing Yao, Ping Luo, Hongyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: A generalist robot should perform effectively across various environments. However, most existing approaches heavily rely on scaling action-annotated data to enhance their capabilities. Consequently, they are often limited to single physical specification and struggle to learn transferable knowledge across different embodiments and environments. To confront these limitations, we propose UniVLA, a new framework for learning cross-embodiment vision-language-action (VLA) policies. Our key innovation is to derive task-centric action representations from videos with a latent action model. This enables us to exploit extensive data across a wide spectrum of embodiments and perspectives. To mitigate the effect of task-irrelevant dynamics, we incorporate language instructions and establish a latent action model within the DINO feature space. Learned from internet-scale videos, the generalist policy can be deployed to various robots through efficient latent action decoding. We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and navigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments. UniVLA achieves superior performance over OpenVLA with less than 1/20 of pretraining compute and 1/10 of downstream data. Continuous performance improvements are observed as heterogeneous data, even including human videos, are incorporated into the training pipeline. The results underscore UniVLA's potential to facilitate scalable and efficient robot policy learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Han, Yumeng Sun, Weiqiang Huang, Hongye Zheng, Junliang Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot text classification has important application value in low-resource environments. This paper proposes a strategy that combines adaptive fine-tuning, contrastive learning, and regularization optimization to improve the classification performance of Transformer-based models. Experiments on the FewRel 2.0 dataset show that T5-small, DeBERTa-v3, and RoBERTa-base perform well in few-shot tasks, especially in the 5-shot setting, which can more effectively capture text features and improve classification accuracy. The experiment also found that there are significant differences in the classification difficulty of different relationship categories. Some categories have fuzzy semantic boundaries or complex feature distributions, making it difficult for the standard cross entropy loss to learn the discriminative information required to distinguish categories. By introducing contrastive loss and regularization loss, the generalization ability of the model is enhanced, effectively alleviating the overfitting problem in few-shot environments. In addition, the research results show that the use of Transformer models or generative architectures with stronger self-attention mechanisms can help improve the stability and accuracy of few-shot classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Idan Attias, Xing Gao, Lev Reyzin</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-augmented algorithms are a prominent recent development in beyond worst-case analysis. In this framework, a problem instance is provided with a prediction (``advice'') from a machine-learning oracle, which provides partial information about an optimal solution, and the goal is to design algorithms that leverage this advice to improve worst-case performance. We study the classic Boolean satisfiability (SAT) decision and optimization problems within this framework using two forms of advice. ``Subset advice" provides a random $\epsilon$ fraction of the variables from an optimal assignment, whereas ``label advice" provides noisy predictions for all variables in an optimal assignment.
  For the decision problem $k$-SAT, by using the subset advice we accelerate the exponential running time of the PPSZ family of algorithms due to Paturi, Pudlak, Saks and Zane, which currently represent the state of the art in the worst case. We accelerate the running time by a multiplicative factor of $2^{-c}$ in the base of the exponent, where $c$ is a function of $\epsilon$ and $k$. For the optimization problem, we show how to incorporate subset advice in a black-box fashion with any $\alpha$-approximation algorithm, improving the approximation ratio to $\alpha + (1 - \alpha)\epsilon$. Specifically, we achieve approximations of $0.94 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-$2$-SAT, $7/8 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-$3$-SAT, and $0.79 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-SAT. Moreover, for label advice, we obtain near-optimal approximation for instances with large average degree, thereby generalizing recent results on MAX-CUT and MAX-$2$-LIN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niladri Shekhar Dutt, Duygu Ceylan, Niloy J. Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs. Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural alternatives.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Schneider, Cristiana de Farias, Roberto Calandra, Liming Chen, Jan Peters</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans make extensive use of haptic exploration to map and identify the properties of the objects that we touch. In robotics, active tactile perception has emerged as an important research domain that complements vision for tasks such as object classification, shape reconstruction, and manipulation. This work introduces TAP (Task-agnostic Active Perception) -- a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer-based architectures to address the challenges posed by partially observable environments. TAP integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and CrossQ algorithms within a unified optimization objective, jointly training a perception module and decision-making policy. By design, TAP is completely task-agnostic and can, in principle, generalize to any active perception problem. We evaluate TAP across diverse tasks, including toy examples and realistic applications involving haptic exploration of 3D models from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TAP, achieving high accuracies on the Tactile MNIST haptic digit recognition task and a tactile pose estimation task. These findings underscore the potential of TAP as a versatile and generalizable framework for advancing active tactile perception in robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayuan Mao, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Jiajun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This article presents a concept-centric paradigm for building agents that can learn continually and reason flexibly. The concept-centric agent utilizes a vocabulary of neuro-symbolic concepts. These concepts, such as object, relation, and action concepts, are grounded on sensory inputs and actuation outputs. They are also compositional, allowing for the creation of novel concepts through their structural combination. To facilitate learning and reasoning, the concepts are typed and represented using a combination of symbolic programs and neural network representations. Leveraging such neuro-symbolic concepts, the agent can efficiently learn and recombine them to solve various tasks across different domains, ranging from 2D images, videos, 3D scenes, and robotic manipulation tasks. This concept-centric framework offers several advantages, including data efficiency, compositional generalization, continual learning, and zero-shot transfer.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the first application of the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline $\texttt{cecilia}$ to determine the physical parameters and photospheric composition of five metal-polluted He-atmosphere white dwarfs without well-characterised elemental abundances. To achieve this, we perform a joint and iterative Bayesian fit to their $\textit{SDSS}$ (R=2,000) and $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ (R=4,500) optical spectra, covering the wavelength range from about 3,800\r{A} to 9,000\r{A}. Our analysis measures the abundances of at least two $-$and up to six$-$ chemical elements in their atmospheres with a predictive accuracy similar to that of conventional WD analysis techniques ($\approx$0.20 dex). The white dwarfs with the largest number of detected heavy elements are SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which simultaneously exhibit O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe in their $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ spectra. For all systems, we find that the bulk composition of their pollutants is largely consistent with those of primitive CI chondrites to within 1-2$\sigma$. We also find evidence of statistically significant ($>2\sigma$) oxygen excesses for SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of oxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical surveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community, $\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs, therefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar compositions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce NPEFF (Non-Negative Per-Example Fisher Factorization), an interpretability method that aims to uncover strategies used by a model to generate its predictions. NPEFF decomposes per-example Fisher matrices using a novel decomposition algorithm that learns a set of components represented by learned rank-1 positive semi-definite matrices. Through a combination of human evaluation and automated analysis, we demonstrate that these NPEFF components correspond to model processing strategies for a variety of language models and text processing tasks. We further show how to construct parameter perturbations from NPEFF components to selectively disrupt a given component's role in the model's processing. Along with conducting extensive ablation studies, we include experiments to show how NPEFF can be used to analyze and mitigate collateral effects of unlearning and use NPEFF to study in-context learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the advantages of NPEFF over baselines such as gradient clustering and using sparse autoencoders for dictionary learning over model activations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gouki Minegishi, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Grokking is an intriguing phenomenon of delayed generalization, where neural networks initially memorize training data with perfect accuracy but exhibit poor generalization, subsequently transitioning to a generalizing solution with continued training. While factors such as weight norms and sparsity have been proposed to explain this delayed generalization, the influence of network structure remains underexplored. In this work, we link the grokking phenomenon to the lottery ticket hypothesis to investigate the impact of internal network structures. We demonstrate that utilizing lottery tickets obtained during the generalizing phase (termed grokked tickets) significantly reduces delayed generalization across various tasks, including multiple modular arithmetic operations, polynomial regression, sparse parity, and MNIST classification. Through controlled experiments, we show that the mitigation of delayed generalization is not due solely to reduced weight norms or increased sparsity, but rather to the discovery of good subnetworks. Furthermore, we find that grokked tickets exhibit periodic weight patterns, beneficial graph properties such as increased average path lengths and reduced clustering coefficients, and undergo rapid structural changes that coincide with improvements in generalization. Additionally, pruning techniques like the edge-popup algorithm can identify these effective structures without modifying the weights, thereby transforming memorizing networks into generalizing ones. These results underscore the novel insight that structural exploration plays a pivotal role in understanding grokking.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Liang, Donghua Yang, Zhiyu Liang, Hongzhi Wang, Zheng Liang, Xiyang Zhang, Jianfeng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent times, the field of unsupervised representation learning (URL) for time series data has garnered significant interest due to its remarkable adaptability across diverse downstream applications. Unsupervised learning goals differ from downstream tasks, making it tricky to ensure downstream task utility by focusing only on temporal feature characterization. Researchers have proposed multiple transformations to extract discriminative patterns implied in informative time series, trying to fill the gap. Despite the introduction of a variety of feature engineering techniques, e.g. spectral domain, wavelet transformed features, features in image form and symbolic features etc. the utilization of intricate feature fusion methods and dependence on heterogeneous features during inference hampers the scalability of the solutions. To address this, our study introduces an innovative approach that focuses on aligning and binding time series representations encoded from different modalities, inspired by spectral graph theory, thereby guiding the neural encoder to uncover latent pattern associations among these multi-modal features. In contrast to conventional methods that fuse features from multiple modalities, our proposed approach simplifies the neural architecture by retaining a single time series encoder, consequently leading to preserved scalability. We further demonstrate and prove mechanisms for the encoder to maintain better inductive bias. In our experimental evaluation, we validated the proposed method on a diverse set of time series datasets from various domains. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art URL methods across diverse downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernhard Jaeger, Andreas Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: Training a deep neural network to maximize a target objective has become the standard recipe for successful machine learning over the last decade. These networks can be optimized with supervised learning, if the target objective is differentiable. For many interesting problems, this is however not the case. Common objectives like intersection over union (IoU), bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score or rewards cannot be optimized with supervised learning. A common workaround is to define differentiable surrogate losses, leading to suboptimal solutions with respect to the actual objective. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising alternative for optimizing deep neural networks to maximize non-differentiable objectives in recent years. Examples include aligning large language models via human feedback, code generation, object detection or control problems. This makes RL techniques relevant to the larger machine learning audience. The subject is, however, time intensive to approach due to the large range of methods, as well as the often very theoretical presentation. In this introduction, we take an alternative approach, different from classic reinforcement learning textbooks. Rather than focusing on tabular problems, we introduce reinforcement learning as a generalization of supervised learning, which we first apply to non-differentiable objectives and later to temporal problems. Assuming only basic knowledge of supervised learning, the reader will be able to understand state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms like proximal policy optimization (PPO) after reading this tutorial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas M\"uller, Carlo Curino, Raghu Ramakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are transforming machine learning across many modalities, with in-context learning replacing classical model training. Recent work on tabular data hints at a similar opportunity to build foundation models for classification for numerical data. However, existing meta-learning approaches can not compete with tree-based methods in terms of inference time. In this paper, we propose MotherNet, a hypernetwork architecture trained on synthetic classification tasks that, once prompted with a never-seen-before training set generates the weights of a trained ``child'' neural-network by in-context learning using a single forward pass. In contrast to most existing hypernetworks that are usually trained for relatively constrained multi-task settings, MotherNet can create models for multiclass classification on arbitrary tabular datasets without any dataset specific gradient descent. The child network generated by MotherNet outperforms neural networks trained using gradient descent on small datasets, and is comparable to predictions by TabPFN and standard ML methods like Gradient Boosting. Unlike a direct application of TabPFN, MotherNet generated networks are highly efficient at inference time. We also demonstrate that HyperFast is unable to perform effective in-context learning on small datasets, and heavily relies on dataset specific fine-tuning and hyper-parameter tuning, while MotherNet requires no fine-tuning or per-dataset hyper-parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robust federated learning aims to maintain reliable performance despite the presence of adversarial or misbehaving workers. While state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust distributed gradient descent (Robust-DGD) methods were proven theoretically optimal, their empirical success has often relied on pre-aggregation gradient clipping. However, existing static clipping strategies yield inconsistent results: enhancing robustness against some attacks while being ineffective or even detrimental against others. To address this limitation, we propose a principled adaptive clipping strategy, Adaptive Robust Clipping (ARC), which dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on the input gradients. We prove that ARC not only preserves the theoretical robustness guarantees of SOTA Robust-DGD methods but also provably improves asymptotic convergence when the model is well-initialized. Extensive experiments on benchmark image classification tasks confirm these theoretical insights, demonstrating that ARC significantly enhances robustness, particularly in highly heterogeneous and adversarial settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaizheng Wang, Fabio Cuzzolin, Keivan Shariatmadar, David Moens, Hans Hallez</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach, called credal wrapper, to formulating a credal set representation of model averaging for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles (DEs), capable of improving uncertainty estimation in classification tasks. Given a finite collection of single predictive distributions derived from BNNs or DEs, the proposed credal wrapper approach extracts an upper and a lower probability bound per class, acknowledging the epistemic uncertainty due to the availability of a limited amount of distributions. Such probability intervals over classes can be mapped on a convex set of probabilities (a credal set) from which, in turn, a unique prediction can be obtained using a transformation called intersection probability transformation. In this article, we conduct extensive experiments on several out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks, encompassing various dataset pairs (CIFAR10/100 vs SVHN/Tiny-ImageNet, CIFAR10 vs CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100 vs CIFAR100-C and ImageNet vs ImageNet-O) and using different network architectures (such as VGG16, ResNet-18/50, EfficientNet B2, and ViT Base). Compared to the BNN and DE baselines, the proposed credal wrapper method exhibits superior performance in uncertainty estimation and achieves a lower expected calibration error on corrupted data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghwan Cheon, Sang Wan Lee, Se-Bum Paik</p>
<p>Abstract: The brain prepares for learning even before interacting with the environment, by refining and optimizing its structures through spontaneous neural activity that resembles random noise. However, the mechanism of such a process has yet to be thoroughly understood, and it is unclear whether this process can benefit the algorithm of machine learning. Here, we study this issue using a neural network with a feedback alignment algorithm, demonstrating that pretraining neural networks with random noise increases the learning efficiency as well as generalization abilities without weight transport. First, we found that random noise training modifies forward weights to match backward synaptic feedback, which is necessary for teaching errors by feedback alignment. As a result, a network with pre-aligned weights learns notably faster than a network without random noise training, even reaching a convergence speed comparable to that of a backpropagation algorithm. Sequential training with both random noise and data brings weights closer to synaptic feedback than training solely with data, enabling more precise credit assignment and faster learning. We also found that each readout probability approaches the chance level and that the effective dimensionality of weights decreases in a network pretrained with random noise. This pre-regularization allows the network to learn simple solutions of a low rank, reducing the generalization loss during subsequent training. This also enables the network robustly to generalize a novel, out-of-distribution dataset. Lastly, we confirmed that random noise pretraining reduces the amount of meta-loss, enhancing the network ability to adapt to various tasks. Overall, our results suggest that random noise training with feedback alignment offers a straightforward yet effective method of pretraining that facilitates quick and reliable learning without weight transport.</p>

This paper presents Horae, a unified specification language for modeling (multimodal) regulation rules across a diverse set of domains. We showcase how Horae facilitates an intelligent service regulation pipeline by further exploiting a fine-tuned large language model named RuleGPT that automates the Horae modeling process, thereby yielding an end-to-end framework for fully automated intelligent service regulation. The feasibility and effectiveness of our framework are demonstrated over a benchmark of various real-world regulation domains. In particular, we show that our open-sourced, fine-tuned RuleGPT with 7B parameters suffices to outperform GPT-3.5 and perform on par with GPT-4o.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youyang Qu, Ming Liu, Tianqing Zhu, Longxiang Gao, Shui Yu, Wanlei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in a decentralized manner while preserving data privacy and minimizing communication overhead. This survey examines recent advancements in FL-driven LLMs, with a particular emphasis on architectural designs, performance optimization, and security concerns, including the emerging area of machine unlearning. In this context, machine unlearning refers to the systematic removal of specific data contributions from trained models to comply with privacy regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten. We review a range of strategies enabling unlearning in federated LLMs, including perturbation-based methods, model decomposition, and incremental retraining, while evaluating their trade-offs in terms of efficiency, privacy guarantees, and model utility. Through selected case studies and empirical evaluations, we analyze how these methods perform in practical FL scenarios. This survey identifies critical research directions toward developing secure, adaptable, and high-performing federated LLM systems for real-world deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amey Agrawal, Haoran Qiu, Junda Chen, \'I\~nigo Goiri, Chaojie Zhang, Rayyan Shahid, Ramachandran Ramjee, Alexey Tumanov, Esha Choukse</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving long inference requests of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. We show that existing work for long context inference is largely based on techniques from long context training, and does not handle the high variability in input lengths during inference. This leads to inefficient resource utilization, server fragmentation, and head-of-line (HOL) blocking.
  We present Medha, an end-to-end system for efficient long-context LLM inference that addresses these challenges through fine-grained time sharing. Medha introduces three key innovations: (1) the mechanism of adaptive prefill chunking to help mitigate HOL blocking with preemption; (2) two new parallelism strategies: Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce time-to-first-token by pipelining prefill chunks, and KV-Cache Parallelism (KVP) to lower time-peroutput-token by distributing decoding across servers; and (3) a novel input-length aware least remaining slack scheduling to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
  Medha enables exact inference scaling beyond 10 million tokens, maintaining high throughput and low latency across mixed-length workloads. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, Medha reduces server fragmentation, cuts median latency by up to 30x, and improves throughput by over 5x, delivering production-scale long-context inference without compromising performance on shorter requests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satoshi Hayakawa, Yuhta Takida, Masaaki Imaizumi, Hiromi Wakaki, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performances in various fields of generative modeling, but suffer from slow sampling speed due to their iterative nature. While this issue is being addressed in continuous domains, discrete diffusion models face unique challenges, particularly in capturing dependencies between elements (e.g., pixel relationships in image, sequential dependencies in language) mainly due to the computational cost of processing high-dimensional joint distributions. In this paper, (i) we propose "mixture" models for discrete diffusion that are capable of treating dimensional correlations while remaining scalable, and (ii) we provide a set of loss functions for distilling the iterations of existing models. Two primary theoretical insights underpin our approach: First, conventional models with element-wise independence can well approximate the data distribution, but essentially require {\it many sampling steps}. Second, our loss functions enable the mixture models to distill such many-step conventional models into just a few steps by learning the dimensional correlations. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling pretrained discrete diffusion models across image and language domains.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we discuss learning algorithms and their importance in different types of applications which includes training to identify important patterns and features in a straightforward, easy-to-understand manner. We will review the main concepts of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid models. Some important subsets of Machine Learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are also discussed in this paper. These techniques can be used for some important tasks like prediction, classification, and segmentation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for image and video processing and many more applications. We dive into the architecture of CNNs and how to integrate CNNs with ML algorithms to build hybrid models. This paper explores the vulnerability of learning algorithms to noise, leading to misclassification. We further discuss the integration of learning algorithms with Large Language Models (LLM) to generate coherent responses applicable to many domains such as healthcare, marketing, and finance by learning important patterns from large volumes of data.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16386">LEGO-Learn: Label-Efficient Graph Open-Set Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyan Xu, Kay Liu, Zhengtao Yao, Philip S. Yu, Mengyuan Li, Kaize Ding, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: How can we train graph-based models to recognize unseen classes while keeping labeling costs low? Graph open-set learning (GOL) and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aim to address this challenge by training models that can accurately classify known, in-distribution (ID) classes while identifying and handling previously unseen classes during inference. It is critical for high-stakes, real-world applications where models frequently encounter unexpected data, including finance, security, and healthcare. However, current GOL methods assume access to many labeled ID samples, which is unrealistic for large-scale graphs due to high annotation costs. In this paper, we propose LEGO-Learn (Label-Efficient Graph Open-set Learning), a novel framework that tackles open-set node classification on graphs within a given label budget by selecting the most informative ID nodes. LEGO-Learn employs a GNN-based filter to identify and exclude potential OOD nodes and then select highly informative ID nodes for labeling using the K-Medoids algorithm. To prevent the filter from discarding valuable ID examples, we introduce a classifier that differentiates between the C known ID classes and an additional class representing OOD nodes (hence, a C+1 classifier). This classifier uses a weighted cross-entropy loss to balance the removal of OOD nodes while retaining informative ID nodes. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that LEGO-Learn significantly outperforms leading methods, with up to a 6.62% improvement in ID classification accuracy and a 7.49% increase in AUROC for OOD detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renhao Wang, Kevin Frans, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, Alexei A. Efros</p>
<p>Abstract: Sample-efficient online reinforcement learning often uses replay buffers to store experience for reuse when updating the value function. However, uniform replay is inefficient, since certain classes of transitions can be more relevant to learning. While prioritization of more useful samples is helpful, this strategy can also lead to overfitting, as useful samples are likely to be more rare. In this work, we instead propose a prioritized, parametric version of an agent's memory, using generative models to capture online experience. This paradigm enables (1) densification of past experience, with new generations that benefit from the generative model's generalization capacity and (2) guidance via a family of "relevance functions" that push these generations towards more useful parts of an agent's acquired history. We show this recipe can be instantiated using conditional diffusion models and simple relevance functions such as curiosity- or value-based metrics. Our approach consistently improves performance and sample efficiency in both state- and pixel-based domains. We expose the mechanisms underlying these gains, showing how guidance promotes diversity in our generated transitions and reduces overfitting. We also showcase how our approach can train policies with even higher update-to-data ratios than before, opening up avenues to better scale online RL agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates crash severity risk modeling strategies for work zones involving large vehicles (i.e., trucks, buses, and vans) under crash data imbalance between low-severity (LS) and high-severity (HS) crashes. We utilized crash data involving large vehicles in South Carolina work zones from 2014 to 2018, which included four times more LS crashes than HS crashes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the crash severity prediction performance of various statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models under different feature selection and data balancing techniques. Findings highlight a disparity in LS and HS predictions, with lower accuracy for HS crashes due to class imbalance and feature overlap. Discriminative Mutual Information (DMI) yields the most effective feature set for predicting HS crashes without requiring data balancing, particularly when paired with gradient boosting models and deep neural networks such as CatBoost, NeuralNetTorch, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Data balancing techniques such as NearMiss-1 maximize HS recall when combined with DMI-selected features and certain models such as LightGBM, making them well-suited for HS crash prediction. Conversely, RandomUnderSampler, HS Class Weighting, and RandomOverSampler achieve more balanced performance, which is defined as an equitable trade-off between LS and HS metrics, especially when applied to NeuralNetTorch, NeuralNetFastAI, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Bayesian Mixed Logit (BML) using merged feature sets or models without feature selection. The insights from this study offer safety analysts guidance on selecting models, feature selection, and data balancing techniques aligned with specific safety goals, providing a robust foundation for enhancing work-zone crash severity prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh Tu Ngo, Chuan Song Heng, Nandish Chattopadhyay, Anupam Chattopadhyay</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained considerable traction in recent years due to the unparalleled results they gathered. However, the cost behind training such sophisticated models is resource intensive, resulting in many to consider DNNs to be intellectual property (IP) to model owners. In this era of cloud computing, high-performance DNNs are often deployed all over the internet so that people can access them publicly. As such, DNN watermarking schemes, especially backdoor-based watermarks, have been actively developed in recent years to preserve proprietary rights. Nonetheless, there lies much uncertainty on the robustness of existing backdoor watermark schemes, towards both adversarial attacks and unintended means such as fine-tuning neural network models. One reason for this is that no complete guarantee of robustness can be assured in the context of backdoor-based watermark. In this paper, we extensively evaluate the persistence of recent backdoor-based watermarks within neural networks in the scenario of fine-tuning, we propose/develop a novel data-driven idea to restore watermark after fine-tuning without exposing the trigger set. Our empirical results show that by solely introducing training data after fine-tuning, the watermark can be restored if model parameters do not shift dramatically during fine-tuning. Depending on the types of trigger samples used, trigger accuracy can be reinstated to up to 100%. Our study further explores how the restoration process works using loss landscape visualization, as well as the idea of introducing training data in fine-tuning stage to alleviate watermark vanishing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Feng, Yuanzhe Gao, Alberto Huertas Celdran, Gerome Bovet, Burkhard Stiller</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is widely recognized as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm due to its model-sharing mechanism that avoids direct data exchange. Nevertheless, model training leaves exploitable traces that can be used to infer sensitive information. In Decentralized FL (DFL), the topology, defining how participants are connected, plays a crucial role in shaping the model's privacy, robustness, and convergence. However, the topology introduces an unexplored vulnerability: attackers can exploit it to infer participant relationships and launch targeted attacks. This work uncovers the hidden risks of DFL topologies by proposing a novel Topology Inference Attack that infers the topology solely from model behavior. A taxonomy of topology inference attacks is introduced, categorizing them by the attacker's capabilities and knowledge. Practical attack strategies are designed for various scenarios, and experiments are conducted to identify key factors influencing attack success. The results demonstrate that analyzing only the model of each node can accurately infer the DFL topology, highlighting a critical privacy risk in DFL systems. These findings offer valuable insights for improving privacy preservation in DFL environments.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13986">An Efficient Sparse Kernel Generator for O(3)-Equivariant Deep Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Bharadwaj, Austin Glover, Aydin Buluc, James Demmel</p>
<p>Abstract: Rotation equivariant graph neural networks, i.e. networks designed to guarantee certain geometric relations between their inputs and outputs, yield state of the art performance on spatial deep learning tasks. They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly-structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedups over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing the limited GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of smaller kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our kernels offer up to 1.3x speedup over NVIDIA's closed-source cuEquivariance package, as well as 10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. In FP64 precision, we offer up to 6.2x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingxiang Liu, Chenghao Liu, Sheng Sun, Di Yao, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection of multivariate time series is a challenging task, given the requirements of deriving a compact detection criterion without accessing the anomaly points. The existing methods are mainly based on reconstruction error or association divergence, which are both confined to isolated subsequences with limited horizons, hardly promising unified series-level criterion. In this paper, we propose the Global Dictionary-enhanced Transformer (GDformer) with a renovated dictionary-based cross attention mechanism to cultivate the global representations shared by all normal points in the entire series. Accordingly, the cross-attention maps reflect the correlation weights between the point and global representations, which naturally leads to the representation-wise similarity-based detection criterion. To foster more compact detection boundary, prototypes are introduced to capture the distribution of normal point-global correlation weights. GDformer consistently achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection performance on five real-world benchmark datasets. Further experiments validate the global dictionary has great transferability among various datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/yuppielqx/GDformer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods used for solving real-world optimization problems often involve dynamic state-action spaces, larger scale, and sparse rewards, leading to significant challenges in convergence, scalability, and efficient exploration of the solution space. This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiru Jiao, Sander van Cranenburgh, Simeon Calvert, Hans van Lint</p>
<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aristotelis Ballas, Christos Diou</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) research has gained considerable traction as of late, since the ability to generalize to unseen data distributions is a requirement that eludes even state-of-the-art training algorithms. In this paper we observe that the initial iterations of model training play a key role in domain generalization effectiveness, since the loss landscape may be significantly different across the training and test distributions, contrary to the case of i.i.d. data. Conflicts between gradients of the loss components of each domain lead the optimization procedure to undesirable local minima that do not capture the domain-invariant features of the target classes. We propose alleviating domain conflicts in model optimization, by iteratively annealing the parameters of a model in the early stages of training and searching for points where gradients align between domains. By discovering a set of parameter values where gradients are updated towards the same direction for each data distribution present in the training set, the proposed Gradient-Guided Annealing (GGA) algorithm encourages models to seek out minima that exhibit improved robustness against domain shifts. The efficacy of GGA is evaluated on five widely accepted and challenging image classification domain generalization benchmarks, where its use alone is able to establish highly competitive or even state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, when combined with previously proposed domain-generalization algorithms it is able to consistently improve their effectiveness by significant margins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Latif, Xiaoming Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Data privacy remains a critical concern in educational research, requiring strict adherence to ethical standards and regulatory protocols. While traditional approaches rely on anonymization and centralized data collection, they often expose raw student data to security vulnerabilities and impose substantial logistical overhead. In this study, we propose a federated learning (FL) framework for automated scoring of educational assessments that eliminates the need to share sensitive data across institutions. Our approach leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling each client (school) to train locally while sharing only optimized model updates. To address data heterogeneity, we implement an adaptive weighted aggregation strategy that considers both client performance and data volume. We benchmark our model against two state-of-the-art FL methods and a centralized learning baseline using NGSS-aligned multi-label science assessment data from nine middle schools. Results show that our model achieves the highest accuracy (94.5%) among FL approaches, and performs within 0.5-1.0 percentage points of the centralized model on these metrics. Additionally, it achieves comparable rubric-level scoring accuracy, with only a 1.3% difference in rubric match and a lower score deviation (MAE), highlighting its effectiveness in preserving both prediction quality and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Herbst, Stefanie Jegelka</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph limit models, like graphons for limits of dense graphs, have recently been used to study size transferability of graph neural networks (GNNs). While most literature focuses on message passing GNNs (MPNNs), in this work we attend to the more powerful higher-order GNNs. First, we extend the $k$-WL test for graphons (B\"oker, 2023) to the graphon-signal space and introduce signal-weighted homomorphism densities as a key tool. As an exemplary focus, we generalize Invariant Graph Networks (IGNs) to graphons, proposing Invariant Graphon Networks (IWNs) defined via a subset of the IGN basis corresponding to bounded linear operators. Even with this restricted basis, we show that IWNs of order $k$ are at least as powerful as the $k$-WL test, and we establish universal approximation results for graphon-signals in $L^p$ distances. This significantly extends the prior work of Cai & Wang (2022), showing that IWNs--a subset of their IGN-small--retain effectively the same expressivity as the full IGN basis in the limit. In contrast to their approach, our blueprint of IWNs also aligns better with the geometry of graphon space, for example facilitating comparability to MPNNs. We highlight that, while typical higher-order GNNs are discontinuous w.r.t. cut distance--which causes their lack of convergence and is inherently tied to the definition of $k$-WL--transferability remains achievable.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21223">Rethinking Graph Structure Learning in the Era of LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihan Zhang, Xunkai Li, Zhu Lei, Guang Zeng, Ronghua Li, Guoren Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the emergence of LLMs has prompted researchers to integrate language descriptions into graphs, aiming to enhance model encoding capabilities from a data-centric perspective. This graph representation is called text-attributed graphs (TAGs). A review of prior advancements highlights that graph structure learning (GSL) is a pivotal technique for improving data utility, making it highly relevant to efficient TAG learning. However, most GSL methods are tailored for traditional graphs without textual information, underscoring the necessity of developing a new GSL paradigm. Despite clear motivations, it remains challenging: (1) How can we define a reasonable optimization objective for GSL in the era of LLMs, considering the massive parameters in LLM? (2) How can we design an efficient model architecture that enables seamless integration of LLM for this optimization objective? For Question 1, we reformulate existing GSL optimization objectives as a tree optimization framework, shifting the focus from obtaining a well-trained edge predictor to a language-aware tree sampler. For Question 2, we propose decoupled and training-free model design principles for LLM integration, shifting the focus from computation-intensive fine-tuning to more efficient inference. Based on this, we propose Large Language and Tree Assistant (LLaTA), which leverages tree-based LLM in-context learning to enhance the understanding of topology and text, enabling reliable inference and generating improved graph structure. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets demonstrate that LLaTA enjoys flexibility-incorporated with any backbone; scalability-outperforms other LLM-enhanced graph learning methods; effectiveness-achieves SOTA predictive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josh Millar, Yushan Huang, Sarab Sethi, Hamed Haddadi, Anil Madhavapeddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient on-device neural network (NN) inference has various advantages over cloud-based processing, including predictable latency, enhanced privacy, greater reliability, and reduced operating costs for vendors. This has sparked the recent rapid development of microcontroller-scale NN accelerators, often referred to as neural processing units ($\mu$NPUs), designed specifically for ultra-low-power applications.
  In this paper we present the first comparative evaluation of a number of commercially-available $\mu$NPUs, as well as the first independent benchmarks for several of these platforms. We develop and open-source a model compilation framework to enable consistent benchmarking of quantized models across diverse $\mu$NPU hardware. Our benchmark targets end-to-end performance and includes model inference latency, power consumption, and memory overhead, alongside other factors. The resulting analysis uncovers both expected performance trends as well as surprising disparities between hardware specifications and actual performance, including $\mu$NPUs exhibiting unexpected scaling behaviors with increasing model complexity. Our framework provides a foundation for further evaluation of $\mu$NPU platforms alongside valuable insights for both hardware designers and software developers in this rapidly evolving space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelmonem Elrefaey, Rong Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Using both observational and experimental data, a causal discovery process can identify the causal relationships between variables. A unique adaptive intervention design paradigm is presented in this work, where causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are for effectively recovered with practical budgetary considerations. In order to choose treatments that optimize information gain under these considerations, an iterative integer programming (IP) approach is proposed, which drastically reduces the number of experiments required. Simulations over a broad range of graph sizes and edge densities are used to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach. Results show that the proposed adaptive IP approach achieves full causal graph recovery with fewer intervention iterations and variable manipulations than random intervention baselines, and it is also flexible enough to accommodate a variety of practical constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harvey Dam, Tripti Agarwal, Ganesh Gopalakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Preserving critical topological features in learned latent spaces is a fundamental challenge in representation learning, particularly for topology-sensitive data. This paper introduces directional sign loss (DSL), a novel loss function that approximates the number of mismatches in the signs of finite differences between corresponding elements of two arrays. By penalizing discrepancies in critical points between input and reconstructed data, DSL encourages autoencoders and other learnable compressors to retain the topological features of the original data. We present the mathematical formulation, complexity analysis, and practical implementation of DSL, comparing its behavior to its non-differentiable counterpart and to other topological measures. Experiments on one-, two-, and three-dimensional data show that combining DSL with traditional loss functions preserves topological features more effectively than traditional losses alone. Moreover, DSL serves as a differentiable, efficient proxy for common topology-based metrics, enabling its use in gradient-based optimization frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shota Deguchi, Mitsuteru Asai</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have attracted significant attention in scientific machine learning for their capability to solve forward and inverse problems governed by partial differential equations. However, the accuracy of PINN solutions is often limited by the treatment of boundary conditions. Conventional penalty-based methods, which incorporate boundary conditions as penalty terms in the loss function, cannot guarantee exact satisfaction of the given boundary conditions and are highly sensitive to the choice of penalty parameters. This paper demonstrates that distance functions, specifically R-functions, can be leveraged to enforce boundary conditions, overcoming these limitations. R-functions provide normalized distance fields, enabling accurate representation of boundary geometries, including non-convex domains, and facilitating various types of boundary conditions. We extend this distance function-based boundary condition imposition method to inverse problems using PINNs and introduce an adaptive weight tuning technique to ensure reliable and efficient inverse analysis. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method through several numerical experiments. Numerical results show that the proposed method solves inverse problems more accurately and efficiently than penalty-based methods, even in the presence of complex non-convex geometries. This approach offers a reliable and efficient framework for inverse analysis using PINNs, with potential applications across a wide range of engineering problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In tackling frequent batch anomalies in high-speed stamping processes, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised in-process anomaly monitoring framework, utilizing accelerometer signals and physics information, to capture the process anomaly effectively. The proposed framework facilitates the construction of a monitoring model with imbalanced sample distribution, which enables in-process condition monitoring in real-time to prevent batch anomalies, which helps to reduce batch defects risk and enhance production yield. Firstly, to effectively capture key features from raw data containing redundant information, a hybrid feature extraction algorithm is proposed to utilize data-driven methods and physical mechanisms simultaneously. Secondly, to address the challenge brought by imbalanced sample distribution, a semi-supervised anomaly detection model is established, which merely employs normal samples to build a golden baseline model, and a novel deviation score is proposed to quantify the anomaly level of each online stamping stroke. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is validated with various classification algorithms. A real-world in-process dataset from stamping manufacturing workshop is employed to illustrate the superiority of proposed semi-supervised framework with enhance performance for process anomaly monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Hsiang Lan, Eric K. Oermann</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farhana Elias, Md Shihab Reza, Muhammad Zawad Mahmud, Samiha Islam, Shahran Rahman Alve</p>
<p>Abstract: The present research tackles the difficulty of predicting osteoporosis risk via machine learning (ML) approaches, emphasizing the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve model transparency. Osteoporosis is a significant public health concern, sometimes remaining untreated owing to its asymptomatic characteristics, and early identification is essential to avert fractures. The research assesses six machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting and utilizes a dataset based on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables. The models are refined using GridSearchCV to calibrate hyperparameters, with the objective of enhancing predictive efficacy. XGBoost had the greatest accuracy (91%) among the evaluated models, surpassing others in precision (0.92), recall (0.91), and F1-score (0.90). The research further integrates XAI approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, and Permutation Feature Importance, to elucidate the decision-making process of the optimal model. The study indicates that age is the primary determinant in forecasting osteoporosis risk, followed by hormonal alterations and familial history. These results corroborate clinical knowledge and affirm the models' therapeutic significance. The research underscores the significance of explainability in machine learning models for healthcare applications, guaranteeing that physicians can rely on the system's predictions. The report ultimately proposes directions for further research, such as validation across varied populations and the integration of supplementary biomarkers for enhanced predictive accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Irene Wang, Newsha Ardalani, Mostafa Elhoushi, Daniel Jiang, Samuel Hsia, Ekin Sumbul, Divya Mahajan, Carole-Jean Wu, Bilge Acun</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of machine learning (ML) systems necessitates a more comprehensive evaluation of their environmental impact, particularly their carbon footprint, which comprises operational carbon from training and inference execution and embodied carbon from hardware manufacturing and its entire life-cycle. Despite the increasing importance of embodied emissions, there is a lack of tools and frameworks to holistically quantify and optimize the total carbon footprint of ML systems. To address this, we propose CATransformers, a carbon-aware architecture search framework that enables sustainability-driven co-optimization of ML models and hardware architectures. By incorporating both operational and embodied carbon metrics into early design space exploration of domain-specific hardware accelerators, CATransformers demonstrates that optimizing for carbon yields design choices distinct from those optimized solely for latency or energy efficiency. We apply our framework to multi-modal CLIP-based models, producing CarbonCLIP, a family of CLIP models achieving up to 17% reduction in total carbon emissions while maintaining accuracy and latency compared to state-of-the-art edge small CLIP baselines. This work underscores the need for holistic optimization methods to design high-performance, environmentally sustainable AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Bielik v3, a series of parameter-efficient generative text models (1.5B and 4.5B) optimized for Polish language processing. These models demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized architectures can achieve performance comparable to much larger counterparts while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Our approach incorporates several key innovations: a custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) that significantly improves token efficiency, Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss to balance learning across instruction types, and Adaptive Learning Rate that dynamically adjusts based on training progress. Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens spanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks, including the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding Benchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter model achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the 1.5B model delivers strong performance despite its extremely compact profile. These advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages, making high-quality Polish language AI more accessible for resource-constrained applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruichu Cai, Junjie Wan, Weilin Chen, Zeqin Yang, Zijian Li, Peng Zhen, Jiecheng Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating long-term causal effects by combining long-term observational and short-term experimental data is a crucial but challenging problem in many real-world scenarios. In existing methods, several ideal assumptions, e.g. latent unconfoundedness assumption or additive equi-confounding bias assumption, are proposed to address the latent confounder problem raised by the observational data. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are typically violated which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the long-term individual causal effects without the aforementioned assumptions. Specifically, we propose to utilize the natural heterogeneity of data, such as data from multiple sources, to identify latent confounders, thereby significantly avoiding reliance on idealized assumptions. Practically, we devise a latent representation learning-based estimator of long-term causal effects. Theoretically, we establish the identifiability of latent confounders, with which we further achieve long-term effect identification. Extensive experimental studies, conducted on multiple synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samir Sadok, Simon Leglaive, Renaud S\'eguier</p>
<p>Abstract: An important challenge in emotion recognition is to develop methods that can leverage unlabeled training data. In this paper, we propose the VQ-MAE-AV model, a self-supervised multimodal model that leverages masked autoencoders to learn representations of audiovisual speech without labels. The model includes vector quantized variational autoencoders that compress raw audio and visual speech data into discrete tokens. The audiovisual speech tokens are used to train a multimodal masked autoencoder that consists of an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms. The model is designed to extract both local (i.e., at the frame level) and global (i.e., at the sequence level) representations of audiovisual speech. During self-supervised pre-training, the VQ-MAE-AV model is trained on a large-scale unlabeled dataset of audiovisual speech, for the task of reconstructing randomly masked audiovisual speech tokens and with a contrastive learning strategy. During this pre-training, the encoder learns to extract a representation of audiovisual speech that can be subsequently leveraged for emotion recognition. During the supervised fine-tuning stage, a small classification model is trained on top of the VQ-MAE-AV encoder for an emotion recognition task. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art emotion recognition results across several datasets in both controlled and in-the-wild conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Scholl, Maged Iskandar, Sebastian Wolf, Jinoh Lee, Aras Bacho, Alexander Dietrich, Alin Albu-Sch\"affer, Gitta Kutyniok</p>
<p>Abstract: In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, wherein artificial intelligence and the automation of machines occupy a central role, the deployment of robots is indispensable. However, the manufacturing process using robots, especially in collaboration with humans, is highly intricate. In particular, modeling the friction torque in robotic joints is a longstanding problem due to the lack of a good mathematical description. This motivates the usage of data-driven methods in recent works. However, model-based and data-driven models often exhibit limitations in their ability to generalize beyond the specific dynamics they were trained on, as we demonstrate in this paper. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on residual learning, which aims to adapt an existing friction model to new dynamics using as little data as possible. We validate our approach by training a base neural network on a symmetric friction data set to learn an accurate relation between the velocity and the friction torque. Subsequently, to adapt to more complex asymmetric settings, we train a second network on a small dataset, focusing on predicting the residual of the initial network's output. By combining the output of both networks in a suitable manner, our proposed estimator outperforms the conventional model-based approach, an extended LuGre model, and the base neural network significantly. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on trajectories involving external loads and still observe a substantial improvement, approximately 60-70%, over the conventional approach. Our method does not rely on data with external load during training, eliminating the need for external torque sensors. This demonstrates the generalization capability of our approach, even with a small amount of data--less than a minute--enabling adaptation to diverse scenarios based on prior knowledge about friction in different settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose hybrid digital-analog learning algorithms on Rydberg atom arrays, combining the potentially practical utility and near-term realizability of quantum learning with the rapidly scaling architectures of neutral atoms. Our construction requires only single-qubit operations in the digital setting and global driving according to the Rydberg Hamiltonian in the analog setting. We perform a comprehensive numerical study of our algorithm on both classical and quantum data, given respectively by handwritten digit classification and unsupervised quantum phase boundary learning. We show in the two representative problems that digital-analog learning is not only feasible in the near term, but also requires shorter circuit depths and is more robust to realistic error models as compared to digital learning schemes. Our results suggest that digital-analog learning opens a promising path towards improved variational quantum learning experiments in the near term.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic sleep staging is essential for sleep assessment and disorder diagnosis. Most existing methods depend on one specific dataset and are limited to be generalized to other unseen datasets, for which the training data and testing data are from the same dataset. In this paper, we introduce domain generalization into automatic sleep staging and propose the task of generalizable sleep staging which aims to improve the model generalization ability to unseen datasets. Inspired by existing domain generalization methods, we adopt the feature alignment idea and propose a framework called SleepDG to solve it. Considering both of local salient features and sequential features are important for sleep staging, we propose a Multi-level Feature Alignment combining epoch-level and sequence-level feature alignment to learn domain-invariant feature representations. Specifically, we design an Epoch-level Feature Alignment to align the feature distribution of each single sleep epoch among different domains, and a Sequence-level Feature Alignment to minimize the discrepancy of sequential features among different domains. SleepDG is validated on five public datasets, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large AI Models (LAIMs), particularly diffusion models and large language models, has marked a new era where AI-generated multimedia is increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life. Although beneficial in numerous fields, this content presents significant risks, including potential misuse, societal disruptions, and ethical concerns. Consequently, detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs has become crucial, with a marked rise in related research. Despite this, there remains a notable gap in systematic surveys that focus specifically on detecting LAIM-generated multimedia. Addressing this, we provide the first survey to comprehensively cover existing research on detecting multimedia (such as text, images, videos, audio, and multimodal content) created by LAIMs. Specifically, we introduce a novel taxonomy for detection methods, categorized by media modality, and aligned with two perspectives: pure detection (aiming to enhance detection performance) and beyond detection (adding attributes like generalizability, robustness, and interpretability to detectors). Additionally, we have presented a brief overview of generation mechanisms, public datasets, online detection tools, and evaluation metrics to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in this field. Most importantly, we offer a focused analysis from a social media perspective to highlight their broader societal impact. Furthermore, we identify current challenges in detection and propose directions for future research that address unexplored, ongoing, and emerging issues in detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs. Our aim for this survey is to fill an academic gap and contribute to global AI security efforts, helping to ensure the integrity of information in the digital realm.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Priorelli, Ivilin Peev Stoianov</p>
<p>Abstract: To determine an optimal plan for complex tasks, one often deals with dynamic and hierarchical relationships between several entities. Traditionally, such problems are tackled with optimal control, which relies on the optimization of cost functions; instead, a recent biologically-motivated proposal casts planning and control as an inference process. Active inference assumes that action and perception are two complementary aspects of life whereby the role of the former is to fulfill the predictions inferred by the latter. Here, we present an active inference approach that exploits discrete and continuous processing, based on three features: the representation of potential body configurations in relation to the objects of interest; the use of hierarchical relationships that enable the agent to easily interpret and flexibly expand its body schema for tool use; the definition of potential trajectories related to the agent's intentions, used to infer and plan with dynamic elements at different temporal scales. We evaluate this deep hybrid model on a habitual task: reaching a moving object after having picked a moving tool. We show that the model can tackle the presented task under different conditions. This study extends past work on planning as inference and advances an alternative direction to optimal control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Dawood, Felix Breuer, Istvan Homolya, Maximilian Gram, Peter M. Jakob, Moritz Zaiss, Martin Blaimer</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Noise resilience in image reconstructions by scan-specific robust artificial neural networks for k-space interpolation (RAKI) is linked to nonlinear activations in k-space. To gain a deeper understanding of this relationship, an image space formalism of RAKI is introduced for analyzing noise propagation analytically, identifying and characterizing image reconstruction features and to describe the role of nonlinear activations in a human readable manner. Methods: The image space formalism for RAKI inference is employed by expressing nonlinear activations in k-space as element-wise multiplications with activation masks, which transform into convolutions in image space. Jacobians of the de-aliased, coil-combined image relative to the aliased coil images can be expressed algebraically, and thus, the noise amplification is quantified analytically (g-factor maps). We analyze the role of nonlinearity for noise resilience by controlling the degree of nonlinearity in the reconstruction model via the negative slope parameter in leaky ReLU. Results: The analytical g-factor maps correspond with those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations and from an auto differentiation approach for in vivo brain images. Apparent blurring and contrast loss artifacts are identified as implications of enhanced noise resilience. These residual artifacts can be traded against noise resilience by adjusting the degree of nonlinearity in the model (Tikhonov-like regularization) in case of limited training data. The inspection of image space activations reveals an autocorrelation pattern leading to a potential center artifact. Conclusion: The image space formalism of RAKI provides the means for analytical quantitative noisepropagation analysis and human-readable visualization of the effects of the nonlinear activation functions in k-space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based motion planning has recently shown the potential to outperform traditional approaches from autonomous navigation to robot manipulation. In this work, we focus on a motion planning task for an evasive target in a partially observable multi-agent adversarial pursuit-evasion game (PEG). Pursuit-evasion problems are relevant to various applications, such as search and rescue operations and surveillance robots, where robots must effectively plan their actions to gather intelligence or accomplish mission tasks while avoiding detection or capture. We propose a hierarchical architecture that integrates a high-level diffusion model to plan global paths responsive to environment data, while a low-level RL policy reasons about evasive versus global path-following behavior. The benchmark results across different domains and different observability show that our approach outperforms baselines by 77.18% and 47.38% on detection and goal reaching rate, which leads to 51.4% increasing of the performance score on average. Additionally, our method improves interpretability, flexibility and efficiency of the learned policy.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the decentralized stochastic subgradient-based methods in minimizing nonsmooth nonconvex functions without Clarke regularity, especially in the decentralized training of nonsmooth neural networks. We propose a general framework that unifies various decentralized subgradient-based methods, such as decentralized stochastic subgradient descent (DSGD), DSGD with gradient-tracking technique (DSGD-T), and DSGD with momentum (DSGD-M). To establish the convergence properties of our proposed framework, we relate the discrete iterates to the trajectories of a continuous-time differential inclusion, which is assumed to have a coercive Lyapunov function with a stable set $\mathcal{A}$. We prove the asymptotic convergence of the iterates to the stable set $\mathcal{A}$ with sufficiently small and diminishing step-sizes. These results provide first convergence guarantees for some well-recognized of decentralized stochastic subgradient-based methods without Clarke regularity of the objective function. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework yields highly efficient decentralized stochastic subgradient-based methods with convergence guarantees in the training of nonsmooth neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Altmayer Pizzorno, Emery D. Berger</p>
<p>Abstract: Testing is an essential part of software development. Test generation tools attempt to automate the otherwise labor-intensive task of test creation, but generating high-coverage tests remains challenging. This paper proposes CoverUp, a novel approach to driving the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests. CoverUp combines coverage analysis, code context, and feedback in prompts that iteratively guide the LLM to generate tests that improve line and branch coverage. We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation- and LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 89% (vs. 77%). We also demonstrate that CoverUp's performance stems not only from the LLM used but from the combined effectiveness of its components.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanxue Gu, Haoyu Dong, Jichen Yang, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated segmentation is a fundamental medical image analysis task, which enjoys significant advances due to the advent of deep learning. While foundation models have been useful in natural language processing and some vision tasks for some time, the foundation model developed with image segmentation in mind - Segment Anything Model (SAM) - has been developed only recently and has shown similar promise. However, there are still no systematic analyses or "best-practice" guidelines for optimal fine-tuning of SAM for medical image segmentation. This work summarizes existing fine-tuning strategies with various backbone architectures, model components, and fine-tuning algorithms across 18 combinations, and evaluates them on 17 datasets covering all common radiology modalities. Our study reveals that (1) fine-tuning SAM leads to slightly better performance than previous segmentation methods, (2) fine-tuning strategies that use parameter-efficient learning in both the encoder and decoder are superior to other strategies, (3) network architecture has a small impact on final performance, (4) further training SAM with self-supervised learning can improve final model performance. We also demonstrate the ineffectiveness of some methods popular in the literature and further expand our experiments into few-shot and prompt-based settings. Lastly, we released our code and MRI-specific fine-tuned weights, which consistently obtained superior performance over the original SAM, at https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/finetune-SAM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiesong Lian, Yucong Huang, Chengdong Ma, Mingzhi Wang, Ying Wen, Long Hu, Yixue Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: For solving zero-sum games involving non-transitivity, a useful approach is to maintain a policy population to approximate the Nash Equilibrium (NE). Previous studies have shown that the Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) algorithm is an effective framework for solving such games. However, current methods initialize a new policy from scratch or inherit a single historical policy in Best Response (BR), missing the opportunity to leverage past policies to generate a better BR. In this paper, we propose Fusion-PSRO, which employs Nash Policy Fusion to initialize a new policy for BR training. Nash Policy Fusion serves as an implicit guiding policy that starts exploration on the current Meta-NE, thus providing a closer approximation to BR. Moreover, it insightfully captures a weighted moving average of past policies, dynamically adjusting these weights based on the Meta-NE in each iteration. This cumulative process further enhances the policy population. Empirical results on classic benchmarks show that Fusion-PSRO achieves lower exploitability, thereby mitigating the shortcomings of previous research on policy initialization in BR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kotaro Ikeda, Tomoya Uda, Daisuke Okanohara, Sosuke Ito</p>
<p>Abstract: We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Using techniques from stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate. This relation can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models with different noise schedules and different data. We numerically discuss our results for optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also demonstrate the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sascha Caron, Nadezhda Dobreva, Antonio Ferrer S\'anchez, Jos\'e D. Mart\'in-Guerrero, Uraz Odyurt, Roberto Ruiz de Austri Bazan, Zef Wolffs, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: High-Energy Physics experiments are facing a multi-fold data increase with every new iteration. This is certainly the case for the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. Such increased data processing requirements forces revisions to almost every step of the data processing pipeline. One such step in need of an overhaul is the task of particle track reconstruction, a.k.a., tracking. A Machine Learning-assisted solution is expected to provide significant improvements, since the most time-consuming step in tracking is the assignment of hits to particles or track candidates. This is the topic of this paper.
  We take inspiration from large language models. As such, we consider two approaches: the prediction of the next word in a sentence (next hit point in a track), as well as the one-shot prediction of all hits within an event. In an extensive design effort, we have experimented with three models based on the Transformer architecture and one model based on the U-Net architecture, performing track association predictions for collision event hit points. In our evaluation, we consider a spectrum of simple to complex representations of the problem, eliminating designs with lower metrics early on. We report extensive results, covering both prediction accuracy (score) and computational performance. We have made use of the REDVID simulation framework, as well as reductions applied to the TrackML data set, to compose five data sets from simple to complex, for our experiments. The results highlight distinct advantages among different designs in terms of prediction accuracy and computational performance, demonstrating the efficiency of our methodology. Most importantly, the results show the viability of a one-shot encoder-classifier based Transformer solution as a practical approach for the task of tracking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusen Wu, Phuong Nguyen, Rose Yesha, Yelena Yesha</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributional drift detection is important in medical applications as it helps ensure the accuracy and reliability of models by identifying changes in the underlying data distribution that could affect the prediction results of machine learning models. However, current methods have limitations in detecting drift, for example, the inclusion of abnormal datasets can lead to unfair comparisons. This paper presents an accurate and sensitive approach to detect distributional drift in CT-scan medical images by leveraging data-sketching and fine-tuning techniques. We developed a robust baseline library model for real-time anomaly detection, allowing for efficient comparison of incoming images and identification of anomalies. Additionally, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Vision Transformer model to extract relevant features, using mammography as a case study, significantly enhancing model accuracy to 99.11%. Combining with data-sketches and fine-tuning, our feature extraction evaluation demonstrated that cosine similarity scores between similar datasets provide greater improvements, from around 50% increased to 99.1%. Finally, the sensitivity evaluation shows that our solutions are highly sensitive to even 1% salt-and-pepper and speckle noise, and it is not sensitive to lighting noise (e.g., lighting conditions have no impact on data drift). The proposed methods offer a scalable and reliable solution for maintaining the accuracy of diagnostic models in dynamic clinical environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulong Feng, Jing Xu, Liujun Hu, Guanghui Yu, Xiangyang Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic communication technology emerges as a pivotal bridge connecting AI with classical communication. The current semantic communication systems are generally modeled as an Auto-Encoder (AE). AE lacks a deep integration of AI principles with communication strategies due to its inability to effectively capture channel dynamics. This gap makes it difficult to justify the need for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) and to explain why performance improves. This paper begins by exploring lossless and lossy communication, highlighting that the inclusion of data distortion distinguishes semantic communication from classical communication. It breaks the conditions for the separation theorem to hold and explains why the amount of data transferred by semantic communication is less. Therefore, employing JSCC becomes imperative for achieving optimal semantic communication. Moreover, a Variational Source-Channel Coding (VSCC) method is proposed for constructing semantic communication systems based on data distortion theory, integrating variational inference and channel characteristics. Using a deep learning network, we develop a semantic communication system employing the VSCC method and demonstrate its capability for semantic transmission. We also establish semantic communication systems of equivalent complexity employing the AE method and the VAE method. Experimental results reveal that the VSCC model offers superior interpretability compared to AE model, as it clearly captures the semantic features of the transmitted data, represented as the variance of latent variables in our experiments. In addition, VSCC model exhibits superior semantic transmission capabilities compared to VAE model. At the same level of data distortion evaluated by PSNR, VSCC model exhibits stronger human interpretability, which can be partially assessed by SSIM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashish Khisti, M. Reza Ebrahimi, Hassan Dbouk, Arash Behboodi, Roland Memisevic, Christos Louizos</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider multi-draft speculative sampling, where the proposal sequences are sampled independently from different draft models. At each step, a token-level draft selection scheme takes a list of valid tokens as input and produces an output token whose distribution matches that of the target model. Previous works have demonstrated that the optimal scheme (which maximizes the probability of accepting one of the input tokens) can be cast as a solution to a linear program. In this work we show that the optimal scheme can be decomposed into a two-step solution: in the first step an importance sampling (IS) type scheme is used to select one intermediate token; in the second step (single-draft) speculative sampling is applied to generate the output token. For the case of two identical draft models we further 1) establish a necessary and sufficient condition on the distributions of the target and draft models for the acceptance probability to equal one and 2) provide an explicit expression for the optimal acceptance probability. Our theoretical analysis also motives a new class of token-level selection schemes based on weighted importance sampling. Our experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in the achievable block efficiency and token rates over baseline schemes in a number of scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections are critical theoretical inputs for long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. However, robust modeling of these cross sections remains challenging. For a simple but physically motivated toy model of the DUNE experiment, we demonstrate that an accurate neural-network model of the cross section -- leveraging Standard Model symmetries -- can be learned from near-detector data. We then perform a neutrino oscillation analysis with simulated far-detector events, finding that the modeled cross section achieves results consistent with what could be obtained if the true cross section were known exactly. This proof-of-principle study highlights the potential of future neutrino near-detector datasets and data-driven cross-section models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael K. Chen, Xikun Zhang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Logical reasoning is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs), and substantial research efforts in recent years have aimed to enhance their deductive reasoning capabilities. However, existing deductive reasoning benchmarks, which are crucial for evaluating and advancing LLMs, are inadequate due to their lack of task complexity, presence of prior knowledge as a confounder, and superficial error analysis. To address these deficiencies, we introduce JustLogic, a synthetically generated deductive reasoning benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. JustLogic is (i) highly complex, capable of generating a diverse range of linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and argument structures; (ii) prior knowledge independent, eliminating the advantage of models possessing prior knowledge and ensuring that only deductive reasoning is used to answer questions; and (iii) capable of in-depth error analysis on the heterogeneous effects of reasoning depth and argument form on model accuracy. Our experimental results on JustLogic reveal that (i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning LLMs perform on par or better than the human average but significantly worse than the human ceiling, and (ii) SOTA non-reasoning models still underperform the human average.

<p>Abstract: We introduce k-LLMmeans, a novel modification of the k-means algorithm for text clustering that leverages LLM-generated summaries as cluster centroids, capturing semantic nuances often missed by purely numerical averages. This design preserves the core optimization properties of k-means while enhancing semantic interpretability and avoiding the scalability and instability issues typical of modern LLM-based clustering. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not increase LLM usage with dataset size and produces transparent intermediate outputs. We further extend it with a mini-batch variant for efficient, real-time clustering of streaming text. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, embeddings, and LLMs show that k-LLMmeans consistently outperforms k-means and other traditional baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based clustering, with a fraction of the LLM calls. Finally, we present a case study on sequential text streams and introduce a new benchmark dataset constructed from StackExchange to evaluate text-stream clustering methods.</p>

Tested across five patients and multiple prediction windows (1 to 14 days), SeizureFormer achieved state-of-the-art performance with mean ROC AUC of 79.44 percent and mean PR AUC of 76.29 percent. Compared to statistical, machine learning, and deep learning baselines, it demonstrates enhanced generalizability and seizure risk forecasting performance under class imbalance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Engels, David D. Baek, Subhash Kantamneni, Max Tegmark</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalable oversight, the process by which weaker AI systems supervise stronger ones, has been proposed as a key strategy to control future superintelligent systems. However, it is still unclear how scalable oversight itself scales. To address this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of successful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the system being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game between capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific Elo scores that are a piecewise-linear function of their general intelligence, with two plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and task saturation. We validate our framework with a modified version of the game Nim and then apply it to four oversight games: Mafia, Debate, Backdoor Code and Wargames. For each game, we find scaling laws that approximate how domain performance depends on general AI system capability. We then build on our findings in a theoretical study of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which trusted models oversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted models in the next step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and derive numerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of oversight levels to maximize the probability of oversight success. We also apply our theory to our four oversight games, where we find that NSO success rates at a general Elo gap of 400 are 13.5% for Mafia, 51.7% for Debate, 10.0% for Backdoor Code, and 9.4% for Wargames; these rates decline further when overseeing stronger systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyong Jin, Runhua Xu, Chao Li, Yizhong Liu, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet it faces significant challenges in communication efficiency and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. While sparsification techniques mitigate communication overhead by transmitting only critical model parameters, they inadvertently amplify security risks: adversarial clients can exploit sparse updates to evade detection and degrade model performance. Existing defense mechanisms, designed for standard FL communication scenarios, are ineffective in addressing these vulnerabilities within sparsified FL. To bridge this gap, we propose FLARE, a novel federated learning framework that integrates sparse index mask inspection and model update sign similarity analysis to detect and mitigate poisoning attacks in sparsified FL. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that FLARE significantly outperforms existing defense strategies, effectively securing sparsified FL against poisoning attacks while maintaining communication efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sriram Mandalika, Harsha Vardhan, Athira Nambiar</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning entails progressively acquiring knowledge from new data while retaining previously acquired knowledge, thereby mitigating ``Catastrophic Forgetting'' in neural networks. Our work presents a novel uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention, achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%, 59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating user interface (UI) design effectiveness extends beyond aesthetics to influencing user behavior, a principle central to Design Persuasiveness. A/B testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS, a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released publicly.</p>

Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips.
