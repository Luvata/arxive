      <title>A constrained optimization approach to improve robustness of neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel nonlinear programming-based approach to fine-tune pre-trained neural networks to improve robustness against adversarial attacks while maintaining high accuracy on clean data. Our method introduces adversary-correction constraints to ensure correct classification of adversarial data and minimizes changes to the model parameters. We propose an efficient cutting-plane-based algorithm to iteratively solve the large-scale nonconvex optimization problem by approximating the feasible region through polyhedral cuts and balancing between robustness and accuracy. Computational experiments on standard datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves robustness, even with a very small set of adversarial data, while maintaining minimal impact on accuracy.</description>

      <title>Learning to Generalize Unseen Domains via Multi-Source Meta Learning for Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning methods, there have been many breakthroughs in the field of text classification. Models developed for this task have been shown to achieve high accuracy. However, most of these models are trained using labeled data from seen domains. It is difficult for these models to maintain high accuracy in a new challenging unseen domain, which is directly related to the generalization of the model. In this paper, we study the multi-source Domain Generalization of text classification and propose a framework to use multiple seen domains to train a model that can achieve high accuracy in an unseen domain. Specifically, we propose a multi-source meta-learning Domain Generalization framework to simulate the process of model generalization to an unseen domain, so as to extract sufficient domain-related features. We introduced a memory mechanism to store domain-specific features, which coordinate with the meta-learning framework. Besides, we adopt the novel "jury" mechanism that enables the model to learn sufficient domain-invariant features. Experiments demonstrate that our meta-learning framework can effectively enhance the ability of the model to generalize to an unseen domain and can outperform the state-of-the-art methods on multi-source text classification datasets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Synthetic Human Trajectories: Imitative Generation and Benchmarks Beyond Datasaurus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human trajectory data, which plays a crucial role in various applications such as crowd management and epidemic prevention, is challenging to obtain due to practical constraints and privacy concerns. In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, the complexity of human mobility patterns is oversimplified by these similarities (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. Moreover, we also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to comprehensively assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-71.5% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement.</description>

      <title>Multi-omics data integration for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complementary information found in different modalities of patient data can aid in more accurate modelling of a patient's disease state and a better understanding of the underlying biological processes of a disease. However, the analysis of multi-modal, multi-omics data presents many challenges, including high dimensionality and varying size, statistical distribution, scale and signal strength between modalities. In this work we compare the performance of a variety of ensemble machine learning algorithms that are capable of late integration of multi-class data from different modalities. The ensemble methods and their variations tested were i) a voting ensemble, with hard and soft vote, ii) a meta learner, iii) a multi-modal Adaboost model using a hard vote, a soft vote and a meta learner to integrate the modalities on each boosting round, the PB-MVBoost model and a novel application of a mixture of experts model. These were compared to simple concatenation as a baseline. We examine these methods using data from an in-house study on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), along with four validation datasets on studies from breast cancer and irritable bowel disease (IBD). Using the area under the receiver operating curve as a measure of performance we develop models that achieve a performance value of up to 0.85 and find that two boosted methods, PB-MVBoost and Adaboost with a soft vote were the overall best performing models. We also examine the stability of features selected, and the size of the clinical signature determined. Finally, we provide recommendations for the integration of multi-modal multi-class data.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning for Multimodal Data Fusion of a Soft Gripper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) refers to the ability of an algorithm to continuously and incrementally acquire new knowledge from its environment while retaining previously learned information. A model trained on one data modality often fails when tested with a different modality. A straightforward approach might be to fuse the two modalities by concatenating their features and training the model on the fused data. However, this requires retraining the model from scratch each time it encounters a new domain. In this paper, we introduce a continual learning algorithm capable of incrementally learning different data modalities by leveraging both class-incremental and domain-incremental learning scenarios in an artificial environment where labeled data is scarce, yet non-iid (independent and identical distribution) unlabeled data from the environment is plentiful. The proposed algorithm is efficient and only requires storing prototypes for each class. We evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness on a challenging custom multimodal dataset comprising of tactile data from a soft pneumatic gripper, and visual data from non-stationary images of objects extracted from video sequences. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study on the custom dataset and the Core50 dataset to highlight the contributions of different components of the algorithm. To further demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we perform a real-time experiment for object classification using the soft gripper and an external independent camera setup, all synchronized with the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework.</description>

      <title>Segment Discovery: Enhancing E-commerce Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern e-commerce services frequently target customers with incentives or interventions to engage them in their products such as games, shopping, video streaming, etc. This customer engagement increases acquisition of more customers and retention of existing ones, leading to more business for the company while improving customer experience. Often, customers are either randomly targeted or targeted based on the propensity of desirable behavior. However, such policies can be suboptimal as they do not target the set of customers who would benefit the most from the intervention and they may also not take account of any constraints. In this paper, we propose a policy framework based on uplift modeling and constrained optimization that identifies customers to target for a use-case specific intervention so as to maximize the value to the business, while taking account of any given constraints. We demonstrate improvement over state-of-the-art targeting approaches using two large-scale experimental studies and a production implementation.</description>

      <title>More Consideration to the Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the gated perceptron, an enhancement of the conventional perceptron, which incorporates an additional input computed as the product of the existing inputs. This allows the perceptron to capture non-linear interactions between features, significantly improving its ability to classify and regress on complex datasets. We explore its application in both linear and non-linear regression tasks using the Iris dataset, as well as binary and multi-class classification problems, including the PIMA Indian dataset and Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Our results demonstrate that the gated perceptron can generate more distinct decision regions compared to traditional perceptrons, enhancing its classification capabilities, particularly in handling non-linear data. Performance comparisons show that the gated perceptron competes with state-of-the-art classifiers while maintaining a simple architecture.</description>

      <title>Wormhole: Concept-Aware Deep Representation Learning for Co-Evolving Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and understanding dynamic concepts in co-evolving sequences is crucial for analyzing complex systems such as IoT applications, financial markets, and online activity logs. These concepts provide valuable insights into the underlying structures and behaviors of sequential data, enabling better decision-making and forecasting. This paper introduces Wormhole, a novel deep representation learning framework that is concept-aware and designed for co-evolving time sequences. Our model presents a self-representation layer and a temporal smoothness constraint to ensure robust identification of dynamic concepts and their transitions. Additionally, concept transitions are detected by identifying abrupt changes in the latent space, signifying a shift to new behavior - akin to passing through a wormhole. This novel mechanism accurately discerns concepts within co-evolving sequences and pinpoints the exact locations of these wormholes, enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations. Experiments demonstrate that this method can effectively segment time series data into meaningful concepts, providing a valuable tool for analyzing complex temporal patterns and advancing the detection of concept drifts.</description>

      <title>Persistent Backdoor Attacks in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to neural networks, enabling adversaries to manipulate model outputs on specific inputs, often with devastating consequences, especially in critical applications. While backdoor attacks have been studied in various contexts, little attention has been given to their practicality and persistence in continual learning, particularly in understanding how the continual updates to model parameters, as new data distributions are learned and integrated, impact the effectiveness of these attacks over time. To address this gap, we introduce two persistent backdoor attacks-Blind Task Backdoor and Latent Task Backdoor-each leveraging minimal adversarial influence. Our blind task backdoor subtly alters the loss computation without direct control over the training process, while the latent task backdoor influences only a single task's training, with all other tasks trained benignly. We evaluate these attacks under various configurations, demonstrating their efficacy with static, dynamic, physical, and semantic triggers. Our results show that both attacks consistently achieve high success rates across different continual learning algorithms, while effectively evading state-of-the-art defenses, such as SentiNet and I-BAU.</description>

      <title>Data Distribution Shifts in (Industrial) Federated Learning as a Privacy Issue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider industrial federated learning, a collaboration between a small number of powerful, potentially competing industrial players, mediated by a third party aspiring to improve the service it provides to its customers. We argue that this configuration harbours covert privacy risks that do not arise in e.g. cross-device settings. Companies are very protective of their intellectual property and production processes. Information about changes to their production and the timing of which is to be kept private. We study a scenario in which one of the collaborators infers changes to their competitors' production by detecting potentially subtle temporal data distribution shifts. In this framing, a data distribution shift is always problematic, even if it has no negative effect on training convergence. Thus, our goal is to find means that allow the detection of distributional shifts better than customary evaluation metrics. Based on the assumption that even minor shifts translate into the collaboratively learned machine learning model, the attacker tracks the shared models' internal state with a selection of metrics from literature in order to pick up on relevant changes. In an empirical study on benchmark datasets, we show an honest-but-curious attacker to be capable of detecting subtle distributional shifts on other clients, in some cases long before they become obvious in evaluation.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Variational State-Space Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations are important mechanistic models that are integral to many scientific and engineering applications. With the abundance of available data there has been a growing interest in data-driven physics-informed models. Gaussian processes (GPs) are particularly suited to this task as they can model complex, non-linear phenomena whilst incorporating prior knowledge and quantifying uncertainty. Current approaches have found some success but are limited as they either achieve poor computational scalings or focus only on the temporal setting. This work addresses these issues by introducing a variational spatio-temporal state-space GP that handles linear and non-linear physical constraints while achieving efficient linear-in-time computation costs. We demonstrate our methods in a range of synthetic and real-world settings and outperform the current state-of-the-art in both predictive and computational performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the second-place methodology in the Volvo Discovery Challenge at ECML-PKDD 2024, where we used Long Short-Term Memory networks and pseudo-labeling to predict maintenance needs for a component of Volvo trucks. We processed the training data to mirror the test set structure and applied a base LSTM model to label the test data iteratively. This approach refined our model's predictive capabilities and culminated in a macro-average F1-score of 0.879, demonstrating robust performance in predictive maintenance. This work provides valuable insights for applying machine learning techniques effectively in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Tabular Data Generation using Binary Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating synthetic tabular data is critical in machine learning, especially when real data is limited or sensitive. Traditional generative models often face challenges due to the unique characteristics of tabular data, such as mixed data types and varied distributions, and require complex preprocessing or large pretrained models. In this paper, we introduce a novel, lossless binary transformation method that converts any tabular data into fixed-size binary representations, and a corresponding new generative model called Binary Diffusion, specifically designed for binary data. Binary Diffusion leverages the simplicity of XOR operations for noise addition and removal and employs binary cross-entropy loss for training. Our approach eliminates the need for extensive preprocessing, complex noise parameter tuning, and pretraining on large datasets. We evaluate our model on several popular tabular benchmark datasets, demonstrating that Binary Diffusion outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on Travel, Adult Income, and Diabetes datasets while being significantly smaller in size.</description>

      <title>Learning to Play Video Games with Intuitive Physics Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video game playing is an extremely structured domain where algorithmic decision-making can be tested without adverse real-world consequences. While prevailing methods rely on image inputs to avoid the problem of hand-crafting state space representations, this approach systematically diverges from the way humans actually learn to play games. In this paper, we design object-based input representations that generalize well across a number of video games. Using these representations, we evaluate an agent's ability to learn games similar to an infant - with limited world experience, employing simple inductive biases derived from intuitive representations of physics from the real world. Using such biases, we construct an object category representation to be used by a Q-learning algorithm and assess how well it learns to play multiple games based on observed object affordances. Our results suggest that a human-like object interaction setup capably learns to play several video games, and demonstrates superior generalizability, particularly for unfamiliar objects. Further exploring such methods will allow machines to learn in a human-centric way, thus incorporating more human-like learning benefits.</description>

      <title>Causal Feature Selection Method for Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits in Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Features (a.k.a. context) are critical for contextual multi-armed bandits (MAB) performance. In practice of large scale online system, it is important to select and implement important features for the model: missing important features can led to sub-optimal reward outcome, and including irrelevant features can cause overfitting, poor model interpretability, and implementation cost. However, feature selection methods for conventional machine learning models fail short for contextual MAB use cases, as conventional methods select features correlated with the outcome variable, but not necessarily causing heterogeneuous treatment effect among arms which are truely important for contextual MAB. In this paper, we introduce model-free feature selection methods designed for contexutal MAB problem, based on heterogeneous causal effect contributed by the feature to the reward distribution. Empirical evaluation is conducted based on synthetic data as well as real data from an online experiment for optimizing content cover image in a recommender system. The results show this feature selection method effectively selects the important features that lead to higher contextual MAB reward than unimportant features. Compared with model embedded method, this model-free method has advantage of fast computation speed, ease of implementation, and prune of model mis-specification issues.</description>

      <title>On-device Collaborative Language Modeling via a Mixture of Generalists and Specialists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We target on-device collaborative fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) by adapting a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, where experts are Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules. In conventional MoE approaches, experts develop into specialists throughout training. In contrast, we propose a novel $\textbf{Co}$llaborative learning approach via a $\textbf{Mi}$xture of $\textbf{G}$eneralists and $\textbf{S}$pecialists (CoMiGS). Diversifying into the two roles is achieved by aggregating certain experts globally while keeping others localized to specialize in user-specific datasets. Central to our work is a learnable routing network that routes at a token level, balancing collaboration and personalization at the finest granularity. Our method consistently demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with high data heterogeneity across various datasets. By design, our approach accommodates varying computational resource constraints among users as shown in different numbers of LoRA experts. We further showcase that low-resourced users can benefit from high-resourced users with high data quantity.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Flood Probability Mapping Using Generative Machine Learning with Large-Scale Synthetic Precipitation and Inundation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution flood probability maps are essential for addressing the limitations of existing flood risk assessment approaches but are often limited by the availability of historical event data. Also, producing simulated data needed for creating probabilistic flood maps using physics-based models involves significant computation and time effort inhibiting the feasibility. To address this gap, this study introduces Flood-Precip GAN (Flood-Precipitation Generative Adversarial Network), a novel methodology that leverages generative machine learning to simulate large-scale synthetic inundation data to produce probabilistic flood maps. With a focus on Harris County, Texas, Flood-Precip GAN begins with training a cell-wise depth estimator using a limited number of physics-based model-generated precipitation-flood events. This model, which emphasizes precipitation-based features, outperforms universal models. Subsequently, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with constraints is employed to conditionally generate synthetic precipitation records. Strategic thresholds are established to filter these records, ensuring close alignment with true precipitation patterns. For each cell, synthetic events are smoothed using a K-nearest neighbors algorithm and processed through the depth estimator to derive synthetic depth distributions. By iterating this procedure and after generating 10,000 synthetic precipitation-flood events, we construct flood probability maps in various formats, considering different inundation depths. Validation through similarity and correlation metrics confirms the fidelity of the synthetic depth distributions relative to true data. Flood-Precip GAN provides a scalable solution for generating synthetic flood depth data needed to create high-resolution flood probability maps, significantly enhancing flood preparedness and mitigation efforts.</description>

      <title>Learning Recourse Costs from Pairwise Feature Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique for incorporating user input when learning and inferring user preferences. When trying to provide users of black-box machine learning models with actionable recourse, we often wish to incorporate their personal preferences about the ease of modifying each individual feature. These recourse finding algorithms usually require an exhaustive set of tuples associating each feature to its cost of modification. Since it is hard to obtain such costs by directly surveying humans, in this paper, we propose the use of the Bradley-Terry model to automatically infer feature-wise costs using non-exhaustive human comparison surveys. We propose that users only provide inputs comparing entire recourses, with all candidate feature modifications, determining which recourses are easier to implement relative to others, without explicit quantification of their costs. We demonstrate the efficient learning of individual feature costs using MAP estimates, and show that these non-exhaustive human surveys, which do not necessarily contain data for each feature pair comparison, are sufficient to learn an exhaustive set of feature costs, where each feature is associated with a modification cost.</description>

      <title>One Model, Any Conjunctive Query: Graph Neural Networks for Answering Complex Queries over Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional query answering over knowledge graphs -- or broadly over relational data -- is one of the most fundamental problems in data management. Motivated by the incompleteness of modern knowledge graphs, a new setup for query answering has emerged, where the goal is to predict answers that do not necessarily appear in the knowledge graph, but are present in its completion. In this work, we propose AnyCQ, a graph neural network model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph, following training. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network model trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Our approach and problem setup differ from existing query answering studies in multiple dimensions. First, we focus on the problem of query answer classification: given a query and a set of possible answers, classify these proposals as true or false relative to the complete knowledge graph. Second, we study the problem of query answer retrieval: given a query, retrieve an answer to the query relative to the complete knowledge graph or decide that no correct solutions exist. Trained on simple, small instances, AnyCQ can generalize to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to samples where existing approaches fail, which is empirically validated on new and challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our AnyCQ models effectively transfer to out-of-distribution knowledge graphs, when equipped with a relevant link predictor, highlighting their potential to serve as a general engine for query answering.</description>

      <title>Boolean Product Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently achieved significant success, with a key operation involving the aggregation of information from neighboring nodes. Substantial researchers have focused on defining neighbors for aggregation, predominantly based on observed adjacency matrices. However, in many scenarios, the explicitly given graphs contain noise, which can be amplified during the messages-passing process. Therefore, many researchers have turned their attention to latent graph inference, specifically learning a parametric graph. To mitigate fluctuations in latent graph structure learning, this paper proposes a novel Boolean product-based graph residual connection in GNNs to link the latent graph and the original graph. It computes the Boolean product between the latent graph and the original graph at each layer to correct the learning process. The Boolean product between two adjacency matrices is equivalent to triangle detection. Accordingly, the proposed Boolean product graph neural networks can be interpreted as discovering triangular cliques from the original and the latent graph. We validate the proposed method in benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to enhance the performance and robustness of GNNs.</description>

      <title>Test Time Learning for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting has seen significant advancements with the introduction of token prediction mechanisms such as multi-head attention. However, these methods often struggle to achieve the same performance as in language modeling, primarily due to the quadratic computational cost and the complexity of capturing long-range dependencies in time-series data. State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have shown promise in addressing these challenges by offering efficient solutions with linear RNNs capable of modeling long sequences with larger context windows. However, there remains room for improvement in accuracy and scalability.
  We propose the use of Test-Time Training (TTT) modules in a parallel architecture to enhance performance in long-term time series forecasting. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that TTT modules consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including the Mamba-based TimeMachine, particularly in scenarios involving extended sequence and prediction lengths. Our results show significant improvements in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), especially on larger datasets such as Electricity, Traffic, and Weather, underscoring the effectiveness of TTT in capturing long-range dependencies. Additionally, we explore various convolutional architectures within the TTT framework, showing that even simple configurations like 1D convolution with small filters can achieve competitive results. This work sets a new benchmark for time-series forecasting and lays the groundwork for future research in scalable, high-performance forecasting models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating time series data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) presents several prevalent challenges, such as slow convergence, information loss in embedding spaces, instability, and performance variability depending on the series length. To tackle these obstacles, we introduce a robust framework aimed at addressing and mitigating these issues effectively. This advanced framework integrates the benefits of an Autoencoder-generated embedding space with the adversarial training dynamics of GANs. This framework benefits from a time series-based loss function and oversight from a supervisory network, both of which capture the stepwise conditional distributions of the data effectively. The generator functions within the latent space, while the discriminator offers essential feedback based on the feature space. Moreover, we introduce an early generation algorithm and an improved neural network architecture to enhance stability and ensure effective generalization across both short and long time series. Through joint training, our framework consistently outperforms existing benchmarks, generating high-quality time series data across a range of real and synthetic datasets with diverse characteristics.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Exposure Bias in Score-Based Generation of Molecular Conformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular conformation generation poses a significant challenge in the field of computational chemistry. Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) are effectively used due to their capacity for generating accurate conformations far beyond conventional physics-based approaches. However, the discrepancy between training and inference rises a critical problem known as the exposure bias. While this issue has been extensively investigated in DPMs, the existence of exposure bias in SGMs and its effective measurement remain unsolved, which hinders the use of compensation methods for SGMs, including ConfGF and Torsional Diffusion as the representatives. In this work, we first propose a method for measuring exposure bias in SGMs used for molecular conformation generation, which confirms the significant existence of exposure bias in these models and measures its value. We design a new compensation algorithm Input Perturbation (IP), which is adapted from a method originally designed for DPMs only. Experimental results show that by introducing IP, SGM-based molecular conformation models can significantly improve both the accuracy and diversity of the generated conformations. Especially by using the IP-enhanced Torsional Diffusion model, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the GEOM-Drugs dataset and are on par on GEOM-QM9. We provide the code publicly at https://github.com/jia-975/torsionalDiff-ip.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Representations for Speed-of-Sound Estimation in Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of the speed-of-sound (SoS) is important for ultrasound (US) image reconstruction techniques and tissue characterization. Various approaches have been proposed to calculate SoS, ranging from tomography-inspired algorithms like CUTE to convolutional networks, and more recently, physics-informed optimization frameworks based on differentiable beamforming. In this work, we utilize implicit neural representations (INRs) for SoS estimation in US. INRs are a type of neural network architecture that encodes continuous functions, such as images or physical quantities, through the weights of a network. Implicit networks may overcome the current limitations of SoS estimation techniques, which mainly arise from the use of non-adaptable and oversimplified physical models of tissue. Moreover, convolutional networks for SoS estimation, usually trained using simulated data, often fail when applied to real tissues due to out-of-distribution and data-shift issues. In contrast, implicit networks do not require extensive training datasets since each implicit network is optimized for an individual data case. This adaptability makes them suitable for processing US data collected from varied tissues and across different imaging protocols.
  We evaluated the proposed SoS estimation method based on INRs using data collected from a tissue-mimicking phantom containing four cylindrical inclusions, with SoS values ranging from 1480 m/s to 1600 m/s. The inclusions were immersed in a material with an SoS value of 1540 m/s. In experiments, the proposed method achieved strong performance, clearly demonstrating the usefulness of implicit networks for quantitative US applications.</description>

      <title>Recovering Global Data Distribution Locally in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaboration among multiple clients to train a shared model without sharing raw data. However, a major challenge in FL is the label imbalance, where clients may exclusively possess certain classes while having numerous minority and missing classes. Previous works focus on optimizing local updates or global aggregation but ignore the underlying imbalanced label distribution across clients. In this paper, we propose a novel approach ReGL to address this challenge, whose key idea is to Recover the Global data distribution Locally. Specifically, each client uses generative models to synthesize images that complement the minority and missing classes, thereby alleviating label imbalance. Moreover, we adaptively fine-tune the image generation process using local real data, which makes the synthetic images align more closely with the global distribution. Importantly, both the generation and fine-tuning processes are conducted at the client-side without leaking data privacy. Through comprehensive experiments on various image classification datasets, we demonstrate the remarkable superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art works in fundamentally tackling label imbalance in FL.</description>

      <title>One-shot World Models Using a Transformer Trained on a Synthetic Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A World Model is a compressed spatial and temporal representation of a real world environment that allows one to train an agent or execute planning methods. However, world models are typically trained on observations from the real world environment, and they usually do not enable learning policies for other real environments. We propose One-Shot World Model (OSWM), a transformer world model that is learned in an in-context learning fashion from purely synthetic data sampled from a prior distribution. Our prior is composed of multiple randomly initialized neural networks, where each network models the dynamics of each state and reward dimension of a desired target environment. We adopt the supervised learning procedure of Prior-Fitted Networks by masking next-state and reward at random context positions and query OSWM to make probabilistic predictions based on the remaining transition context. During inference time, OSWM is able to quickly adapt to the dynamics of a simple grid world, as well as the CartPole gym and a custom control environment by providing 1k transition steps as context and is then able to successfully train environment-solving agent policies. However, transferring to more complex environments remains a challenge, currently. Despite these limitations, we see this work as an important stepping-stone in the pursuit of learning world models purely from synthetic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stunting detection is a significant issue in Indonesian healthcare, causing lower cognitive function, lower productivity, a weakened immunity, delayed neuro-development, and degenerative diseases. In regions with a high prevalence of stunting and limited welfare resources, identifying children in need of treatment is critical. The diagnostic process often raises challenges, such as the lack of experience in medical workers, incompatible anthropometric equipment, and inefficient medical bureaucracy. To counteract the issues, the use of load cell sensor and ultrasonic sensor can provide suitable anthropometric equipment and streamline the medical bureaucracy for stunting detection. This paper also employs machine learning for stunting detection based on sensor readings. The experiment results show that the sensitivity of the load cell sensor and the ultrasonic sensor is 0.9919 and 0.9986, respectively. Also, the machine learning test results have three classification classes, which are normal, stunted, and stunting with an accuracy rate of 98\%.</description>

      <title>When Witnesses Defend: A Witness Graph Topological Layer for Adversarial Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capitalizing on the intuitive premise that shape characteristics are more robust to perturbations, we bridge adversarial graph learning with the emerging tools from computational topology, namely, persistent homology representations of graphs. We introduce the concept of witness complex to adversarial analysis on graphs, which allows us to focus only on the salient shape characteristics of graphs, yielded by the subset of the most essential nodes (i.e., landmarks), with minimal loss of topological information on the whole graph. The remaining nodes are then used as witnesses, governing which higher-order graph substructures are incorporated into the learning process. Armed with the witness mechanism, we design Witness Graph Topological Layer (WGTL), which systematically integrates both local and global topological graph feature representations, the impact of which is, in turn, automatically controlled by the robust regularized topological loss. Given the attacker's budget, we derive the important stability guarantees of both local and global topology encodings and the associated robust topological loss. We illustrate the versatility and efficiency of WGTL by its integration with five GNNs and three existing non-topological defense mechanisms. Our extensive experiments across six datasets demonstrate that WGTL boosts the robustness of GNNs across a range of perturbations and against a range of adversarial attacks, leading to relative gains of up to 18%.</description>

      <title>Component-based Sketching for Deep ReLU Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has made profound impacts in the domains of data mining and AI, distinguished by the groundbreaking achievements in numerous real-world applications and the innovative algorithm design philosophy. However, it suffers from the inconsistency issue between optimization and generalization, as achieving good generalization, guided by the bias-variance trade-off principle, favors under-parameterized networks, whereas ensuring effective convergence of gradient-based algorithms demands over-parameterized networks. To address this issue, we develop a novel sketching scheme based on deep net components for various tasks. Specifically, we use deep net components with specific efficacy to build a sketching basis that embodies the advantages of deep networks. Subsequently, we transform deep net training into a linear empirical risk minimization problem based on the constructed basis, successfully avoiding the complicated convergence analysis of iterative algorithms. The efficacy of the proposed component-based sketching is validated through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Theoretically, we show that the proposed component-based sketching provides almost optimal rates in approximating saturated functions for shallow nets and also achieves almost optimal generalization error bounds. Numerically, we demonstrate that, compared with the existing gradient-based training methods, component-based sketching possesses superior generalization performance with reduced training costs.</description>

      <title>A Distribution-Aware Flow-Matching for Generating Unstructured Data for Few-Shot Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse unstructured data is a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in few-shot learning scenarios where data is scarce. Traditional RL methods often rely on extensive datasets or simulations, which are costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a distribution-aware flow matching, designed to generate synthetic unstructured data tailored specifically for an application of few-shot RL called Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) on embedded processors. This method leverages the sample efficiency of flow matching and incorporates statistical learning techniques such as bootstrapping to improve its generalization and robustness of the latent space. Additionally, we apply feature weighting through Random Forests to prioritize critical data aspects, thereby improving the precision of the generated synthetic data. This approach not only mitigates the challenges of overfitting and data correlation in unstructured data in traditional Model-Based RL but also aligns with the Law of Large Numbers, ensuring convergence to true empirical values and optimal policy as the number of samples increases. Through extensive experimentation on an application of DVFS for low energy processing, we demonstrate that our method provides an stable convergence based on max Q-value while enhancing frame rate by 30\% in the very beginning first timestamps, making this RL model efficient in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>On Lexical Invariance on Multisets and Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this draft, we study a novel problem, called lexical invariance, using the medium of multisets and graphs. Traditionally in the NLP domain, lexical invariance indicates that the semantic meaning of a sentence should remain unchanged regardless of the specific lexical or word-based representation of the input. For example, ``The movie was extremely entertaining'' would have the same meaning as ``The film was very enjoyable''. In this paper, we study a more challenging setting, where the output of a function is invariant to any injective transformation applied to the input lexical space. For example, multiset {1,2,3,2} is equivalent to multiset {a,b,c,b} if we specify an injective transformation that maps 1 to a, 2 to b and 3 to c. We study the sufficient and necessary conditions for a most expressive lexical invariant (and permutation invariant) function on multisets and graphs, and proves that for multisets, the function must have a form that only takes the multiset of counts of the unique elements in the original multiset as input. For example, a most expressive lexical invariant function on {a,b,c,b} must have a form that only operates on {1,1,2} (meaning that there are 1, 1, 2 unique elements corresponding to a,c,b). For graphs, we prove that a most expressive lexical invariant and permutation invariant function must have a form that only takes the adjacency matrix and a difference matrix as input, where the (i,j)th element of the difference matrix is 1 if node i and node j have the same feature and 0 otherwise. We perform synthetic experiments on TU datasets to verify our theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Success in todays data-driven corporate climate requires a deep understanding of employee behavior. Companies aim to improve employee satisfaction, boost output, and optimize workflow. This research study delves into creating synthetic data, a powerful tool that allows us to comprehensively understand employee performance, flexibility, cooperation, and team dynamics. Synthetic data provides a detailed and accurate picture of employee activities while protecting individual privacy thanks to cutting-edge methods like agent-based models (ABMs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and statistical models. Through the creation of multiple situations, this method offers insightful viewpoints regarding increasing teamwork, improving adaptability, and accelerating overall productivity. We examine how synthetic data has evolved from a specialized field to an essential resource for researching employee behavior and enhancing management efficiency.

      <title>ReFine: Boosting Time Series Prediction of Extreme Events by Reweighting and Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme events are of great importance since they often represent impactive occurrences. For instance, in terms of climate and weather, extreme events might be major storms, floods, extreme heat or cold waves, and more. However, they are often located at the tail of the data distribution. Consequently, accurately predicting these extreme events is challenging due to their rarity and irregularity. Prior studies have also referred to this as the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, which occurs when the distribution of the test data is substantially different from that used for training. In this work, we propose two strategies, reweighting and fine-tuning, to tackle the challenge. Reweighting is a strategy used to force machine learning models to focus on extreme events, which is achieved by a weighted loss function that assigns greater penalties to the prediction errors for the extreme samples relative to those on the remainder of the data. Unlike previous intuitive reweighting methods based on simple heuristics of data distribution, we employ meta-learning to dynamically optimize these penalty weights. To further boost the performance on extreme samples, we start from the reweighted models and fine-tune them using only rare extreme samples. Through extensive experiments on multiple data sets, we empirically validate that our meta-learning-based reweighting outperforms existing heuristic ones, and the fine-tuning strategy can further increase the model performance. More importantly, these two strategies are model-agnostic, which can be implemented on any type of neural network for time series forecasting.

      <description>arXiv:2409.14235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to machine learning algorithm design based on information theory, specifically mutual information (MI). We propose a framework for learning and representing functional relationships in data using MI-based features. Our method aims to capture the underlying structure of information in datasets, enabling more efficient and generalizable learning algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved performance in tasks such as function classification, regression, and cross-dataset transfer. This work contributes to the growing field of metalearning and automated machine learning, offering a new perspective on how to leverage information theory for algorithm design and dataset analysis and proposing new mutual information theoretic foundations to learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Opinion Mining on Offshore Wind Energy for Environmental Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct sentiment analysis on social media data to study mass opinion about offshore wind energy. We adapt three machine learning models, namely, TextBlob, VADER, and SentiWordNet because different functions are provided by each model. TextBlob provides subjectivity analysis as well as polarity classification. VADER offers cumulative sentiment scores. SentiWordNet considers sentiments with reference to context and performs classification accordingly. Techniques in NLP are harnessed to gather meaning from the textual data in social media. Data visualization tools are suitably deployed to display the overall results. This work is much in line with citizen science and smart governance via involvement of mass opinion to guide decision support. It exemplifies the role of Machine Learning and NLP here.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sketch-and-solve is a powerful paradigm for tackling large-scale computational problems by reducing their dimensionality using sketching matrices. This paper focuses on applying sketch-and-solve algorithms to efficiently solve the overdetermined least squares problem, which is fundamental in various domains such as machine learning, signal processing, and numerical optimization. We provide a comprehensive overview of the sketch-and-solve paradigm and analyze different sketching operators, including dense and sparse variants. We introduce the Sketch-and-Apply (SAA-SAS) algorithm, which leverages randomized numerical linear algebra techniques to compute approximate solutions efficiently. Through extensive experiments on large-scale least squares problems, we demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the traditional Least-Squares QR (LSQR) algorithm in terms of runtime while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of sketch-and-solve techniques in efficiently handling large-scale numerical linear algebra problems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Spatiotemporal Feature Representation and Mining in Multidimensional Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a new method for time series data analysis, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional mining techniques when dealing with multidimensional time series data. Time series data are extensively utilized in diverse fields, including backend services for monitoring and optimizing IT infrastructure, medical diagnosis through continuous patient monitoring and health trend analysis, and internet business for tracking user behavior and forecasting sales. However, since the effective information in time series data is often hidden in sequence fragments, the uncertainty of their length, quantity, and morphological variables brings challenges to mining. To this end, this paper proposes a new spatiotemporal feature representation method, which converts multidimensional time series (MTS) into one-dimensional event sequences by transforming spatially varying events, and uses a series of event symbols to represent the spatial structural information of multidimensional coupling in the sequence, which has good interpretability. Then, this paper introduces a variable-length tuple mining method to extract non-redundant key event subsequences in event sequences as spatiotemporal structural features of motion sequences. This method is an unsupervised method that does not rely on large-scale training samples and defines a new model for representing the spatiotemporal structural features of multidimensional time series. The superior performance of the STEM model is verified by pattern classification experiments on a variety of motion sequences. The research results of this paper provide an important theoretical basis and technical support for understanding and predicting human behavior patterns, and have far-reaching practical application value.</description>

      <title>Sparse Low-Ranked Self-Attention Transformer for Remaining Useful Lifetime Prediction of Optical Fiber Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical fiber amplifiers are key elements in present optical networks. Failures of these components result in high financial loss of income of the network operator as the communication traffic over an affected link is interrupted. Applying Remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction in the context of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) to optical fiber amplifiers to predict upcoming system failures at an early stage, so that network outages can be minimized through planning of targeted maintenance actions, ensures reliability and safety. Optical fiber amplifier are complex systems, that work under various operating conditions, which makes correct forecasting a difficult task. Increased monitoring capabilities of systems results in datasets that facilitate the application of data-driven RUL prediction methods. Deep learning models in particular have shown good performance, but generalization based on comparatively small datasets for RUL prediction is difficult. In this paper, we propose Sparse Low-ranked self-Attention Transformer (SLAT) as a novel RUL prediction method. SLAT is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, wherein two parallel working encoders extract features for sensors and time steps. By utilizing the self-attention mechanism, long-term dependencies can be learned from long sequences. The implementation of sparsity in the attention matrix and a low-rank parametrization reduce overfitting and increase generalization. Experimental application to optical fiber amplifiers exemplified on EDFA, as well as a reference dataset from turbofan engines, shows that SLAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Flat-LoRA: Low-Rank Adaption over a Flat Loss Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models is prohibitively expensive in terms of computational and memory costs. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a popular Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, provides an efficient way to fine-tune models by optimizing only a low-rank matrix. Despite recent progress made in improving LoRA's performance, the connection between the LoRA optimization space and the original full parameter space is often overlooked. A solution that appears flat in the LoRA space may exist sharp directions in the full parameter space, potentially harming generalization performance. In this paper, we propose Flat-LoRA, an efficient approach that seeks a low-rank adaptation located in a flat region of the full parameter space.Instead of relying on the well-established sharpness-aware minimization approach, which can incur significant computational and memory burdens, we utilize random weight perturbation with a Bayesian expectation loss objective to maintain training efficiency and design a refined perturbation generation strategy for improved performance. Experiments on natural language processing and image classification tasks with various architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Hard Samples on Accuracy Reveals In-class Data Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the AutoML domain, test accuracy is heralded as the quintessential metric for evaluating model efficacy, underpinning a wide array of applications from neural architecture search to hyperparameter optimization. However, the reliability of test accuracy as the primary performance metric has been called into question, notably through research highlighting how label noise can obscure the true ranking of state-of-the-art models. We venture beyond, along another perspective where the existence of hard samples within datasets casts further doubt on the generalization capabilities inferred from test accuracy alone. Our investigation reveals that the distribution of hard samples between training and test sets affects the difficulty levels of those sets, thereby influencing the perceived generalization capability of models. We unveil two distinct generalization pathways-toward easy and hard samples-highlighting the complexity of achieving balanced model evaluation. Finally, we propose a benchmarking procedure for comparing hard sample identification methods, facilitating the advancement of more nuanced approaches in this area. Our primary goal is not to propose a definitive solution but to highlight the limitations of relying primarily on test accuracy as an evaluation metric, even when working with balanced datasets, by introducing the in-class data imbalance problem. By doing so, we aim to stimulate a critical discussion within the research community and open new avenues for research that consider a broader spectrum of model evaluation criteria.

      <title>COSBO: Conservative Offline Simulation-Based Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning allows training reinforcement learning models on data from live deployments. However, it is limited to choosing the best combination of behaviors present in the training data. In contrast, simulation environments attempting to replicate the live environment can be used instead of the live data, yet this approach is limited by the simulation-to-reality gap, resulting in a bias. In an attempt to get the best of both worlds, we propose a method that combines an imperfect simulation environment with data from the target environment, to train an offline reinforcement learning policy. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches CQL, MOPO, and COMBO, especially in scenarios with diverse and challenging dynamics, and demonstrates robust behavior across a variety of experimental conditions. The results highlight that using simulator-generated data can effectively enhance offline policy learning despite the sim-to-real gap, when direct interaction with the real-world is not possible.</description>

      <title>Challenging the Performance-Interpretability Trade-off: An Evaluation of Interpretable Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is permeating every conceivable domain to promote data-driven decision support. The focus is often on advanced black-box models due to their assumed performance advantages, whereas interpretable models are often associated with inferior predictive qualities. More recently, however, a new generation of generalized additive models (GAMs) has been proposed that offer promising properties for capturing complex, non-linear patterns while remaining fully interpretable. To uncover the merits and limitations of these models, this study examines the predictive performance of seven different GAMs in comparison to seven commonly used machine learning models based on a collection of twenty tabular benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair and robust model comparison, an extensive hyperparameter search combined with cross-validation was performed, resulting in 68,500 model runs. In addition, this study qualitatively examines the visual output of the models to assess their level of interpretability. Based on these results, the paper dispels the misconception that only black-box models can achieve high accuracy by demonstrating that there is no strict trade-off between predictive performance and model interpretability for tabular data. Furthermore, the paper discusses the importance of GAMs as powerful interpretable models for the field of information systems and derives implications for future work from a socio-technical perspective.</description>

      <title>TabGraphs: A Benchmark and Strong Baselines for Learning on Graphs with Tabular Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular machine learning is an important field for industry and science. In this field, table rows are usually treated as independent data samples, but additional information about relations between them is sometimes available and can be used to improve predictive performance. Such information can be naturally modeled with a graph, thus tabular machine learning may benefit from graph machine learning methods. However, graph machine learning models are typically evaluated on datasets with homogeneous node features, which have little in common with heterogeneous mixtures of numerical and categorical features present in tabular datasets. Thus, there is a critical difference between the data used in tabular and graph machine learning studies, which does not allow one to understand how successfully graph models can be transferred to tabular data. To bridge this gap, we propose a new benchmark of diverse graphs with heterogeneous tabular node features and realistic prediction tasks. We use this benchmark to evaluate a vast set of models, including simple methods previously overlooked in the literature. Our experiments show that graph neural networks (GNNs) can indeed often bring gains in predictive performance for tabular data, but standard tabular models also can be adapted to work with graph data by using simple feature preprocessing, which sometimes enables them to compete with and even outperform GNNs. Based on our empirical study, we provide insights for researchers and practitioners in both tabular and graph machine learning fields.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the promise to revolutionize computing broadly, but their complexity and extensive training data also expose significant privacy vulnerabilities. One of the simplest privacy risks associated with LLMs is their susceptibility to membership inference attacks (MIAs), wherein an adversary aims to determine whether a specific data point was part of the model's training set. Although this is a known risk, state of the art methodologies for MIAs rely on training multiple computationally costly shadow models, making risk evaluation prohibitive for large models. Here we adapt a recent line of work which uses quantile regression to mount membership inference attacks; we extend this work by proposing a low-cost MIA that leverages an ensemble of small quantile regression models to determine if a document belongs to the model's training set or not. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on fine-tuned LLMs of varying families (OPT, Pythia, Llama) and across multiple datasets. Across all scenarios we obtain comparable or improved accuracy compared to state of the art shadow model approaches, with as little as 6% of their computation budget. We demonstrate increased effectiveness across multi-epoch trained target models, and architecture miss-specification robustness, that is, we can mount an effective attack against a model using a different tokenizer and architecture, without requiring knowledge on the target model.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Identifying Multi-Agent Coordinated Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a minimax distributionally robust inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm to reconstruct the utility functions of a multi-agent sensing system. Specifically, we construct utility estimators which minimize the worst-case prediction error over a Wasserstein ambiguity set centered at noisy signal observations. We prove the equivalence between this robust estimation and a semi-infinite optimization reformulation, and we propose a consistent algorithm to compute solutions. We illustrate the efficacy of this robust IRL scheme in numerical studies to reconstruct the utility functions of a cognitive radar network from observed tracking signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) represent a significant breakthrough in deep learning, promising to bridge the gap between machine learning and the rich theoretical frameworks developed in various mathematical fields over centuries. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages adaptive feedforward gradient estimation to improve the efficiency, consistency, and interpretability of Neural ODEs. Our method eliminates the need for backpropagation and the adjoint method, reducing computational overhead and memory usage while maintaining accuracy. The proposed approach has been validated through practical applications, and showed good performance relative to Neural ODEs state of the art methods.</description>

      <title>Domain knowledge-guided machine learning framework for state of health estimation in Lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of battery state of health is crucial for effective electric vehicle battery management. Here, we propose five health indicators that can be extracted online from real-world electric vehicle operation and develop a machine learning-based method to estimate the battery state of health. The proposed indicators provide physical insights into the energy and power fade of the battery and enable accurate capacity estimation even with partially missing data. Moreover, they can be computed for portions of the charging profile and real-world driving discharging conditions, facilitating real-time battery degradation estimation. The indicators are computed using experimental data from five cells aged under electric vehicle conditions, and a linear regression model is used to estimate the state of health. The results show that models trained with power autocorrelation and energy-based features achieve capacity estimation with maximum absolute percentage error within 1.5% to 2.5% .</description>

      <title>Backtracking Improves Generation Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text generation has a fundamental limitation almost by definition: there is no taking back tokens that have been generated, even when they are clearly problematic. In the context of language model safety, when a partial unsafe generation is produced, language models by their nature tend to happily keep on generating similarly unsafe additional text. This is in fact how safety alignment of frontier models gets circumvented in the wild, despite great efforts in improving their safety. Deviating from the paradigm of approaching safety alignment as prevention (decreasing the probability of harmful responses), we propose backtracking, a technique that allows language models to "undo" and recover from their own unsafe generation through the introduction of a special [RESET] token. Our method can be incorporated into either SFT or DPO training to optimize helpfulness and harmlessness. We show that models trained to backtrack are consistently safer than baseline models: backtracking Llama-3-8B is four times more safe than the baseline model (6.1\% $\to$ 1.5\%) in our evaluations without regression in helpfulness. Our method additionally provides protection against four adversarial attacks including an adaptive attack, despite not being trained to do so.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI needs formal notions of explanation correctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) in critical domains such as medicine poses risks and requires regulation. One requirement is that decisions of ML systems in high-risk applications should be human-understandable. The field of "explainable artificial intelligence" (XAI) seemingly addresses this need. However, in its current form, XAI is unfit to provide quality control for ML; it itself needs scrutiny. Popular XAI methods cannot reliably answer important questions about ML models, their training data, or a given test input. We recapitulate results demonstrating that popular XAI methods systematically attribute importance to input features that are independent of the prediction target. This limits their utility for purposes such as model and data (in)validation, model improvement, and scientific discovery. We argue that the fundamental reason for this limitation is that current XAI methods do not address well-defined problems and are not evaluated against objective criteria of explanation correctness. Researchers should formally define the problems they intend to solve first and then design methods accordingly. This will lead to notions of explanation correctness that can be theoretically verified and objective metrics of explanation performance that can be assessed using ground-truth data.</description>

      <title>Testing Causal Models with Hidden Variables in Polynomial Delay via Conditional Independencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing a hypothesized causal model against observational data is a key prerequisite for many causal inference tasks. A natural approach is to test whether the conditional independence relations (CIs) assumed in the model hold in the data. While a model can assume exponentially many CIs (with respect to the number of variables), testing all of them is both impractical and unnecessary. Causal graphs, which encode these CIs in polynomial space, give rise to local Markov properties that enable model testing with a significantly smaller subset of CIs. Model testing based on local properties requires an algorithm to list the relevant CIs. However, existing algorithms for realistic settings with hidden variables and non-parametric distributions can take exponential time to produce even a single CI constraint. In this paper, we introduce the c-component local Markov property (C-LMP) for causal graphs with hidden variables. Since C-LMP can still invoke an exponential number of CIs, we develop a polynomial delay algorithm to list these CIs in poly-time intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that enables poly-delay testing of CIs in causal graphs with hidden variables against arbitrary data distributions. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF) for Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) models can generate high-quality samples from a non-informative prior, but they can be slow, often needing hundreds of network evaluations (NFE). To address this, we propose Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF); IDFF learns a new vector field with an additional momentum term that enables taking longer steps during sample generation while maintaining the fidelity of the generated distribution. Consequently, IDFFs reduce the NFEs by a factor of ten (relative to CFMs) without sacrificing sample quality, enabling rapid sampling and efficient handling of image and time-series data generation tasks. We evaluate IDFF on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and CelebA for image generation. We achieved likelihood and quality performance comparable to CFMs and diffusion-based models with fewer NFEs. IDFF also shows superior performance on time-series datasets modeling, including molecular simulation and sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness across different domains.</description>

      <title>Protein-Mamba: Biological Mamba Models for Protein Function Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein function prediction is a pivotal task in drug discovery, significantly impacting the development of effective and safe therapeutics. Traditional machine learning models often struggle with the complexity and variability inherent in predicting protein functions, necessitating more sophisticated approaches. In this work, we introduce Protein-Mamba, a novel two-stage model that leverages both self-supervised learning and fine-tuning to improve protein function prediction. The pre-training stage allows the model to capture general chemical structures and relationships from large, unlabeled datasets, while the fine-tuning stage refines these insights using specific labeled datasets, resulting in superior prediction performance. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Protein-Mamba achieves competitive performance, compared with a couple of state-of-the-art methods across a range of protein function datasets. This model's ability to effectively utilize both unlabeled and labeled data highlights the potential of self-supervised learning in advancing protein function prediction and offers a promising direction for future research in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>From Lazy to Rich: Exact Learning Dynamics in Deep Linear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological and artificial neural networks develop internal representations that enable them to perform complex tasks. In artificial networks, the effectiveness of these models relies on their ability to build task specific representation, a process influenced by interactions among datasets, architectures, initialization strategies, and optimization algorithms. Prior studies highlight that different initializations can place networks in either a lazy regime, where representations remain static, or a rich/feature learning regime, where representations evolve dynamically. Here, we examine how initialization influences learning dynamics in deep linear neural networks, deriving exact solutions for lambda-balanced initializations-defined by the relative scale of weights across layers. These solutions capture the evolution of representations and the Neural Tangent Kernel across the spectrum from the rich to the lazy regimes. Our findings deepen the theoretical understanding of the impact of weight initialization on learning regimes, with implications for continual learning, reversal learning, and transfer learning, relevant to both neuroscience and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Not Only the Last-Layer Features for Spurious Correlations: All Layer Deep Feature Reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spurious correlations are a major source of errors for machine learning models, in particular when aiming for group-level fairness. It has been recently shown that a powerful approach to combat spurious correlations is to re-train the last layer on a balanced validation dataset, isolating robust features for the predictor. However, key attributes can sometimes be discarded by neural networks towards the last layer. In this work, we thus consider retraining a classifier on a set of features derived from all layers. We utilize a recently proposed feature selection strategy to select unbiased features from all the layers. We observe this approach gives significant improvements in worst-group accuracy on several standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MemeCLIP: Leveraging CLIP Representations for Multimodal Meme Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of text-embedded images presents a formidable challenge in machine learning given the need for multimodal understanding of the multiple aspects of expression conveyed in them. While previous research in multimodal analysis has primarily focused on singular aspects such as hate speech and its subclasses, our study expands the focus to encompass multiple aspects of linguistics: hate, target, stance, and humor detection. We introduce a novel dataset PrideMM comprising text-embedded images associated with the LGBTQ+ Pride movement, thereby addressing a serious gap in existing resources. We conduct extensive experimentation on PrideMM by using unimodal and multimodal baseline methods to establish benchmarks for each task. Additionally, we propose a novel framework MemeCLIP for efficient downstream learning while preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained CLIP model. The results of our experiments show that MemeCLIP achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed frameworks on two real-world datasets. We further compare the performance of MemeCLIP and zero-shot GPT-4 on the hate classification task. Finally, we discuss the shortcomings of our model by qualitatively analyzing misclassified samples. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/SiddhantBikram/MemeCLIP.</description>

      <title>Isometric Immersion Learning with Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manifold learning has been proven to be an effective method for capturing the implicitly intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean data, in which one of the primary challenges is how to maintain the distortion-free (isometry) of the data representations. Actually, there is still no manifold learning method that provides a theoretical guarantee of isometry. Inspired by Nash's isometric theorem, we introduce a new concept called isometric immersion learning based on Riemannian geometry principles. Following this concept, an unsupervised neural network-based model that simultaneously achieves metric and manifold learning is proposed by integrating Riemannian geometry priors. What's more, we theoretically derive and algorithmically implement a maximum likelihood estimation-based training method for the new model. In the simulation experiments, we compared the new model with the state-of-the-art baselines on various 3-D geometry datasets, demonstrating that the new model exhibited significantly superior performance in multiple evaluation metrics. Moreover, we applied the Riemannian metric learned from the new model to downstream prediction tasks in real-world scenarios, and the accuracy was improved by an average of 8.8%.</description>

      <title>Research on Dynamic Data Flow Anomaly Detection based on Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sophistication and diversity of contemporary cyberattacks have rendered the use of proxies, gateways, firewalls, and encrypted tunnels as a standalone defensive strategy inadequate. Consequently, the proactive identification of data anomalies has emerged as a prominent area of research within the field of data security. The majority of extant studies concentrate on sample equilibrium data, with the consequence that the detection effect is not optimal in the context of unbalanced data. In this study, the unsupervised learning method is employed to identify anomalies in dynamic data flows. Initially, multi-dimensional features are extracted from real-time data, and a clustering algorithm is utilised to analyse the patterns of the data. This enables the potential outliers to be automatically identified. By clustering similar data, the model is able to detect data behaviour that deviates significantly from normal traffic without the need for labelled data. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits high accuracy in the detection of anomalies across a range of scenarios. Notably, it demonstrates robust and adaptable performance, particularly in the context of unbalanced data.</description>

      <title>SDBA: A Stealthy and Long-Lasting Durable Backdoor Attack in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning is a promising approach for training machine learning models while preserving data privacy, but its distributed nature makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks, particularly in NLP tasks while related research remains limited. This paper introduces SDBA, a novel backdoor attack mechanism designed for NLP tasks in FL environments. Our systematic analysis across LSTM and GPT-2 models identifies the most vulnerable layers for backdoor injection and achieves both stealth and long-lasting durability through layer-wise gradient masking and top-k% gradient masking within these layers. Experiments on next token prediction and sentiment analysis tasks show that SDBA outperforms existing backdoors in durability and effectively bypasses representative defense mechanisms, with notable performance in LLM such as GPT-2. These results underscore the need for robust defense strategies in NLP-based FL systems.</description>

Abstract: Detecting complex anomalies on massive amounts of data is a crucial task in Industry 4.0, best addressed by deep learning. However, available solutions are computationally demanding, requiring cloud architectures prone to latency and bandwidth issues. This work presents VARADE, a novel solution implementing a light autoregressive framework based on variational inference, which is best suited for real-time execution on the edge. The proposed approach was validated on a robotic arm, part of a pilot production line, and compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms, obtaining the best trade-off between anomaly detection accuracy, power consumption and inference frequency on two different edge platforms.</description>

      <title>Testing Dependency of Weighted Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the task of detecting the edge dependency between two weighted random graphs. We formulate this task as a simple hypothesis testing problem, where under the null hypothesis, the two observed graphs are statistically independent, whereas under the alternative, the edges of one graph are dependent on the edges of a randomly vertex-permuted version of the other graph. For general edge-weights distributions, we establish thresholds at which optimal testing is information-theoretically impossible and possible, as a function of the total number of nodes in the observed graphs and the generative distributions of the weights. Finally, we observe a statistical-computational gap in our problem, and we provide evidence that this is fundamental using the framework of low-degree polynomials.</description>

      <title>Novel Gradient Sparsification Algorithm via Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error accumulation is an essential component of the Top-$k$ sparsification method in distributed gradient descent. It implicitly scales the learning rate and prevents the slow-down of lateral movement, but it can also deteriorate convergence. This paper proposes a novel sparsification algorithm called regularized Top-$k$ (RegTop-$k$) that controls the learning rate scaling of error accumulation. The algorithm is developed by looking at the gradient sparsification as an inference problem and determining a Bayesian optimal sparsification mask via maximum-a-posteriori estimation. It utilizes past aggregated gradients to evaluate posterior statistics, based on which it prioritizes the local gradient entries. Numerical experiments with ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 show that at $0.1\%$ sparsification, RegTop-$k$ achieves about $8\%$ higher accuracy than standard Top-$k$.</description>

      <title>Kriformer: A Novel Spatiotemporal Kriging Approach Based on Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating data in sensor-less areas is crucial for understanding system dynamics, such as traffic state estimation and environmental monitoring. This study addresses challenges posed by sparse sensor deployment and unreliable data by framing the problem as a spatiotemporal kriging task and proposing a novel graph transformer model, Kriformer. This model estimates data at locations without sensors by mining spatial and temporal correlations, even with limited resources. Kriformer utilizes transformer architecture to enhance the model's perceptual range and solve edge information aggregation challenges, capturing spatiotemporal information effectively. A carefully constructed positional encoding module embeds the spatiotemporal features of nodes, while a sophisticated spatiotemporal attention mechanism enhances estimation accuracy. The multi-head spatial interaction attention module captures subtle spatial relationships between observed and unobserved locations. During training, a random masking strategy prompts the model to learn with partial information loss, allowing the spatiotemporal embedding and multi-head attention mechanisms to synergistically capture correlations among locations. Experimental results show that Kriformer excels in representation learning for unobserved locations, validated on two real-world traffic speed datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in spatiotemporal kriging tasks.</description>

      <title>FastGL: A GPU-Efficient Framework for Accelerating Sampling-Based GNN Training at Large Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great superiority on non-Euclidean graph data, achieving ground-breaking performance on various graph-related tasks. As a practical solution to train GNN on large graphs with billions of nodes and edges, the sampling-based training is widely adopted by existing training frameworks. However, through an in-depth analysis, we observe that the efficiency of existing sampling-based training frameworks is still limited due to the key bottlenecks lying in all three phases of sampling-based training, i.e., subgraph sample, memory IO, and computation. To this end, we propose FastGL, a GPU-efficient Framework for accelerating sampling-based training of GNN at Large scale by simultaneously optimizing all above three phases, taking into account both GPU characteristics and graph structure. Specifically, by exploiting the inherent overlap within graph structures, FastGL develops the Match-Reorder strategy to reduce the data traffic, which accelerates the memory IO without incurring any GPU memory overhead. Additionally, FastGL leverages a Memory-Aware computation method, harnessing the GPU memory's hierarchical nature to mitigate irregular data access during computation. FastGL further incorporates the Fused-Map approach aimed at diminishing the synchronization overhead during sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastGL can achieve an average speedup of 11.8x, 2.2x and 1.5x over the state-of-the-art frameworks PyG, DGL, and GNNLab, respectively.Our code is available at https://github.com/a1bc2def6g/fastgl-ae.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learning on User Segmentation: Universal to Specific Representation via Bipartite Neural Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, models for user representation learning have been widely applied in click-through-rate (CTR) and conversion-rate (CVR) prediction. Usually, the model learns a universal user representation as the input for subsequent scenario-specific models. However, in numerous industrial applications (e.g., recommendation and marketing), the business always operates such applications as various online activities among different user segmentation. These segmentation are always created by domain experts. Due to the difference in user distribution (i.e., user segmentation) and business objectives in subsequent tasks, learning solely on universal representation may lead to detrimental effects on both model performance and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework that can first learn general universal user representation through information bottleneck. Then, merge and learn a segmentation-specific or a task-specific representation through neural interaction. We design the interactive learning process by leveraging a bipartite graph architecture to model the representation learning and merging between contextual clusters and each user segmentation. Our proposed method is evaluated in two open-source benchmarks, two offline business datasets, and deployed on two online marketing applications to predict users' CVR. The results demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance and surpass the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>On The Specialization of Neural Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of machine learning models have been proposed with the goal of achieving systematic generalization: the ability to reason about new situations by combining aspects of previous experiences. These models leverage compositional architectures which aim to learn specialized modules dedicated to structures in a task that can be composed to solve novel problems with similar structures. While the compositionality of these architectures is guaranteed by design, the modules specializing is not. Here we theoretically study the ability of network modules to specialize to useful structures in a dataset and achieve systematic generalization. To this end we introduce a minimal space of datasets motivated by practical systematic generalization benchmarks. From this space of datasets we present a mathematical definition of systematicity and study the learning dynamics of linear neural modules when solving components of the task. Our results shed light on the difficulty of module specialization, what is required for modules to successfully specialize, and the necessity of modular architectures to achieve systematicity. Finally, we confirm that the theoretical results in our tractable setting generalize to more complex datasets and non-linear architectures.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Synthetic Activations composed of SAE Latents in GPT-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Auto-Encoders (SAEs) are commonly employed in mechanistic interpretability to decompose the residual stream into monosemantic SAE latents. Recent work demonstrates that perturbing a model's activations at an early layer results in a step-function-like change in the model's final layer activations. Furthermore, the model's sensitivity to this perturbation differs between model-generated (real) activations and random activations. In our study, we assess model sensitivity in order to compare real activations to synthetic activations composed of SAE latents. Our findings indicate that synthetic activations closely resemble real activations when we control for the sparsity and cosine similarity of the constituent SAE latents. This suggests that real activations cannot be explained by a simple "bag of SAE latents" lacking internal structure, and instead suggests that SAE latents possess significant geometric and statistical properties. Notably, we observe that our synthetic activations exhibit less pronounced activation plateaus compared to those typically surrounding real activations.</description>

      <title>A Diagonal Structured State Space Model on Loihi 2 for Efficient Streaming Sequence Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep State-Space Models (SSM) demonstrate state-of-the art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. While the recurrent structure of SSMs can be efficiently implemented as a convolution or as a parallel scan during training, recurrent token-by-token processing cannot currently be implemented efficiently on GPUs. Here, we demonstrate efficient token-by-token inference of the SSM S4D on Intel's Loihi 2 state-of-the-art neuromorphic processor. We compare this first ever neuromorphic-hardware implementation of an SSM on sMNIST, psMNIST, and sCIFAR to a recurrent and a convolutional implementation of S4D on Jetson Orin Nano (Jetson). While we find Jetson to perform better in an offline sample-by-sample based batched processing mode, Loihi 2 outperforms during token-by-token based processing, where it consumes 1000 times less energy with a 75 times lower latency and a 75 times higher throughput compared to the recurrent implementation of S4D on Jetson. This opens up new avenues towards efficient real-time streaming applications of SSMs.</description>

      <title>SHFL: Secure Hierarchical Federated Learning Framework for Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm designed for privacy-sensitive applications that run on resource-constrained devices with non-Identically and Independently Distributed (IID) data. Traditional FL frameworks adopt the client-server model with a single-level aggregation (AGR) process, where the server builds the global model by aggregating all trained local models received from client devices. However, this conventional approach encounters challenges, including susceptibility to model/data poisoning attacks. In recent years, advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing have enabled the development of hierarchical FL systems with a two-level AGR process running at edge and cloud servers. In this paper, we propose a Secure Hierarchical FL (SHFL) framework to address poisoning attacks in hierarchical edge networks. By aggregating trained models at the edge, SHFL employs two novel methods to address model/data poisoning attacks in the presence of client adversaries: 1) a client selection algorithm running at the edge for choosing IoT devices to participate in training, and 2) a model AGR method designed based on convex optimization theory to reduce the impact of edge models from networks with adversaries in the process of computing the global model (at the cloud level). The evaluation results reveal that compared to state-of-the-art methods, SHFL significantly increases the maximum accuracy achieved by the global model in the presence of client adversaries applying model/data poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>AdapFair: Ensuring Continuous Fairness for Machine Learning Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biases and discrimination of machine learning algorithms have attracted significant attention, leading to the development of various algorithms tailored to specific contexts. However, these solutions often fall short of addressing fairness issues inherent in machine learning operations. In this paper, we present a debiasing framework designed to find an optimal fair transformation of input data that maximally preserves data predictability. A distinctive feature of our approach is its flexibility and efficiency. It can be integrated with any downstream black-box classifiers, providing continuous fairness guarantees with minimal retraining efforts, even in the face of frequent data drifts, evolving fairness requirements, and batches of similar tasks. To achieve this, we leverage the normalizing flows to enable efficient, information-preserving data transformation, ensuring that no critical information is lost during the debiasing process. Additionally, we incorporate the Wasserstein distance as the unfairness measure to guide the optimization of data transformations. Finally, we introduce an efficient optimization algorithm with closed-formed gradient computations, making our framework scalable and suitable for dynamic, real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Dispatching Flash Attention For Partially Filled Attention Masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers are widely used across various applications, many of which yield sparse or partially filled attention matrices. Examples include attention masks designed to reduce the quadratic complexity of attention, sequence packing techniques, and recent innovations like tree masking for fast validation in MEDUSA. Despite the inherent sparsity in these matrices, the state-of-the-art algorithm Flash Attention still processes them with quadratic complexity as though they were dense. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Binary Block Masking}, a highly efficient modification that enhances Flash Attention by making it mask-aware. We further propose two optimizations: one tailored for masks with contiguous non-zero patterns and another for extremely sparse masks. Our experiments on attention masks derived from real-world scenarios demonstrate up to a 9x runtime improvement. The implementation will be publicly released to foster further research and application.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning Over the Air: Combating Heavy-Tailed Noise with Median Anchored Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging over-the-air computations for model aggregation is an effective approach to cope with the communication bottleneck in federated edge learning. By exploiting the superposition properties of multi-access channels, this approach facilitates an integrated design of communication and computation, thereby enhancing system privacy while reducing implementation costs. However, the inherent electromagnetic interference in radio channels often exhibits heavy-tailed distributions, giving rise to exceptionally strong noise in globally aggregated gradients that can significantly deteriorate the training performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel gradient clipping method, termed Median Anchored Clipping (MAC), to combat the detrimental effects of heavy-tailed noise. We also derive analytical expressions for the convergence rate of model training with analog over-the-air federated learning under MAC, which quantitatively demonstrates the effect of MAC on training performance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed MAC algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of heavy-tailed noise, hence substantially enhancing system robustness.</description>

      <title>The Number of Trials Matters in Infinite-Horizon General-Utility Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general-utility Markov decision processes (GUMDPs) framework generalizes the MDPs framework by considering objective functions that depend on the frequency of visitation of state-action pairs induced by a given policy. In this work, we contribute with the first analysis on the impact of the number of trials, i.e., the number of randomly sampled trajectories, in infinite-horizon GUMDPs. We show that, as opposed to standard MDPs, the number of trials plays a key-role in infinite-horizon GUMDPs and the expected performance of a given policy depends, in general, on the number of trials. We consider both discounted and average GUMDPs, where the objective function depends, respectively, on discounted and average frequencies of visitation of state-action pairs. First, we study policy evaluation under discounted GUMDPs, proving lower and upper bounds on the mismatch between the finite and infinite trials formulations for GUMDPs. Second, we address average GUMDPs, studying how different classes of GUMDPs impact the mismatch between the finite and infinite trials formulations. Third, we provide a set of empirical results to support our claims, highlighting how the number of trajectories and the structure of the underlying GUMDP influence policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Designing an Interpretable Interface for Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual bandits have become an increasingly popular solution for personalized recommender systems. Despite their growing use, the interpretability of these systems remains a significant challenge, particularly for the often non-expert operators tasked with ensuring their optimal performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a new interface to explain to domain experts the underlying behaviour of a bandit. Central is a metric we term "value gain", a measure derived from off-policy evaluation to quantify the real-world impact of sub-components within a bandit. We conduct a qualitative user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our interface. Our findings suggest that by carefully balancing technical rigour with accessible presentation, it is possible to empower non-experts to manage complex machine learning systems. We conclude by outlining guiding principles that other researchers should consider when building similar such interfaces in future.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Conventional Wisdom in Machine Learning: From Generalization to Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable success of large language pretraining and the discovery of scaling laws signify a paradigm shift in machine learning. Notably, the primary objective has evolved from minimizing generalization error to reducing approximation error, and the most effective strategy has transitioned from regularization (in a broad sense) to scaling up models. This raises a critical question:
  Do the established principles that proved successful in the generalization-centric era remain valid in this new era of scaling?
  This paper examines several influential regularization-based principles that may no longer hold true in the scaling-centric, large language model (LLM) era. These principles include explicit L2 regularization and implicit regularization through small batch sizes and large learning rates. Additionally, we identify a new phenomenon termed ``scaling law crossover,'' where two scaling curves intersect at a certain scale, implying that methods effective at smaller scales may not generalize to larger ones. Together, these observations highlight two fundamental questions within this new paradigm:
  $\bullet$ Guiding Principles for Scaling: If regularization is no longer the primary guiding principle for model design, what new principles are emerging to guide scaling?
  $\bullet$ Model Comparison at Scale: How to reliably and effectively compare models at the scale where only a single experiment is feasible?</description>

      <title>A Gated Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Mixtures of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces KAMoE, a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework based on Gated Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (GRKAN). We propose GRKAN as an alternative to the traditional gating function, aiming to enhance efficiency and interpretability in MoE modeling. Through extensive experiments on digital asset markets and real estate valuation, we demonstrate that KAMoE consistently outperforms traditional MoE architectures across various tasks and model types. Our results show that GRKAN exhibits superior performance compared to standard Gating Residual Networks, particularly in LSTM-based models for sequential tasks. We also provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity and performance gains in MoE and KAMoE architectures.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model discovery with Kolmogorov-Arnold networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven model discovery of complex dynamical systems is typically done using sparse optimization, but it has a fundamental limitation: sparsity in that the underlying governing equations of the system contain only a small number of elementary mathematical terms. Examples where sparse optimization fails abound, such as the classic Ikeda or optical-cavity map in nonlinear dynamics and a large variety of ecosystems. Exploiting the recently articulated Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, we develop a general model-discovery framework for any dynamical systems including those that do not satisfy the sparsity condition. In particular, we demonstrate non-uniqueness in that a large number of approximate models of the system can be found which generate the same invariant set with the correct statistics such as the Lyapunov exponents and Kullback-Leibler divergence. An analogy to shadowing of numerical trajectories in chaotic systems is pointed out.</description>

      <title>Enabling Tensor Decomposition for Time-Series Classification via A Simple Pseudo-Laplacian Contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor decomposition has emerged as a prominent technique to learn low-dimensional representation under the supervision of reconstruction error, primarily benefiting data inference tasks like completion and imputation, but not classification task. We argue that the non-uniqueness and rotation invariance of tensor decomposition allow us to identify the directions with largest class-variability and simple graph Laplacian can effectively achieve this objective. Therefore we propose a novel Pseudo Laplacian Contrast (PLC) tensor decomposition framework, which integrates the data augmentation and cross-view Laplacian to enable the extraction of class-aware representations while effectively capturing the intrinsic low-rank structure within reconstruction constraint. An unsupervised alternative optimization algorithm is further developed to iteratively estimate the pseudo graph and minimize the loss using Alternating Least Square (ALS). Extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>FLeNS: Federated Learning with Enhanced Nesterov-Newton Sketch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning faces a critical challenge in balancing communication efficiency with rapid convergence, especially for second-order methods. While Newton-type algorithms achieve linear convergence in communication rounds, transmitting full Hessian matrices is often impractical due to quadratic complexity. We introduce Federated Learning with Enhanced Nesterov-Newton Sketch (FLeNS), a novel method that harnesses both the acceleration capabilities of Nesterov's method and the dimensionality reduction benefits of Hessian sketching. FLeNS approximates the centralized Newton's method without relying on the exact Hessian, significantly reducing communication overhead. By combining Nesterov's acceleration with adaptive Hessian sketching, FLeNS preserves crucial second-order information while preserving the rapid convergence characteristics. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in statistical learning, demonstrates that FLeNS achieves super-linear convergence rates in communication rounds - a notable advancement in federated optimization. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees and characterize tradeoffs between acceleration, sketch size, and convergence speed. Extensive empirical evaluation validates our theoretical findings, showcasing FLeNS's state-of-the-art performance with reduced communication requirements, particularly in privacy-sensitive and edge-computing scenarios.

      <title>MotifDisco: Motif Causal Discovery For Time Series Motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many time series, particularly health data streams, can be best understood as a sequence of phenomenon or events, which we call motifs. A time series motif is a short trace segment which may implicitly capture an underlying phenomenon within the time series. Specifically, we focus on glucose traces collected from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which inherently contain motifs representing underlying human behaviors such as eating and exercise. The ability to identify and quantify causal relationships amongst motifs can provide a mechanism to better understand and represent these patterns, useful for improving deep learning and generative models and for advanced technology development (e.g., personalized coaching and artificial insulin delivery systems). However, no previous work has developed causal discovery methods for time series motifs. Therefore, in this paper we develop MotifDisco (motif disco-very of causality), a novel causal discovery framework to learn causal relations amongst motifs from time series traces. We formalize a notion of Motif Causality (MC), inspired from Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, and develop a Graph Neural Network-based framework that learns causality between motifs by solving an unsupervised link prediction problem. We also integrate MC with three model use cases of forecasting, anomaly detection and clustering, to showcase the use of MC as a building block for other downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate our framework and find that Motif Causality provides a significant performance improvement in all use cases.</description>

      <title>Semantic Inference-Based Deep Learning and Modeling for Earth Observation: Cognitive Semantic Augmentation Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) systems play a crucial role in achieving Sustainable Development Goals by collecting and analyzing vital global data through satellite networks. These systems are essential for tasks like mapping, disaster monitoring, and resource management, but they face challenges in processing and transmitting large volumes of EO data, especially in specialized fields such as agriculture and real-time disaster response. Domain-adapted Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising solution by facilitating data fusion between extensive EO data and semantic EO data. By improving integration and interpretation of diverse datasets, LLMs address the challenges of processing specialized information in agriculture and disaster response applications. This fusion enhances the accuracy and relevance of transmitted data. This paper presents a framework for semantic communication in EO satellite networks, aimed at improving data transmission efficiency and overall system performance through cognitive processing techniques. The proposed system employs Discrete-Task-Oriented Source-Channel Coding (DT-JSCC) and Semantic Data Augmentation (SA) to focus on relevant information while minimizing communication overhead. By integrating cognitive semantic processing and inter-satellite links, the framework enhances the analysis and transmission of multispectral satellite imagery, improving object detection, pattern recognition, and real-time decision-making. The introduction of Cognitive Semantic Augmentation (CSA) allows satellites to process and transmit semantic information, boosting adaptability to changing environments and application needs. This end-to-end architecture is tailored for next-generation satellite networks, such as those supporting 6G, and demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Archon: An Architecture Search Framework for Inference-Time Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time techniques are emerging as highly effective tools to increase large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, there is still limited understanding of the best practices for developing systems that combine inference-time techniques with one or more LLMs, with challenges including: (1) effectively allocating inference compute budget, (2) understanding the interactions between different combinations of inference-time techniques and their impact on downstream performance, and 3) efficiently searching over the large space of model choices, inference-time techniques, and their compositions. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, an automated framework for designing inference-time architectures. Archon defines an extensible design space, encompassing methods such as generation ensembling, multi-sampling, ranking, fusion, critiquing, verification, and unit testing. It then transforms the problem of selecting and combining LLMs and inference-time techniques into a hyperparameter optimization objective. To optimize this objective, we introduce automated Inference-Time Architecture Search (ITAS) algorithms. Given target benchmark(s), an inference compute budget, and available LLMs, ITAS outputs optimized architectures. We evaluate Archon architectures across a wide range of instruction-following and reasoning benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Arena-Hard-Auto, AlpacaEval 2.0, MixEval, MixEval Hard, MATH, and CodeContests. We show that automatically designed inference-time architectures by Archon outperform strong models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on these benchmarks, achieving an average increase of 14.1 and 10.3 percentage points with all-source models and open-source models, respectively. We make our code and datasets available publicly on Github: https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/Archon.</description>

      <title>UDA-Bench: Revisiting Common Assumptions in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Using a Standardized Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we take a deeper look into the diverse factors that influence the efficacy of modern unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods using a large-scale, controlled empirical study. To facilitate our analysis, we first develop UDA-Bench, a novel PyTorch framework that standardizes training and evaluation for domain adaptation enabling fair comparisons across several UDA methods. Using UDA-Bench, our comprehensive empirical study into the impact of backbone architectures, unlabeled data quantity, and pre-training datasets reveals that: (i) the benefits of adaptation methods diminish with advanced backbones, (ii) current methods underutilize unlabeled data, and (iii) pre-training data significantly affects downstream adaptation in both supervised and self-supervised settings. In the context of unsupervised adaptation, these observations uncover several novel and surprising properties, while scientifically validating several others that were often considered empirical heuristics or practitioner intuitions in the absence of a standardized training and evaluation framework. The UDA-Bench framework and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/ViLab-UCSD/UDABench_ECCV2024.</description>

      <title>Peer-to-Peer Learning Dynamics of Wide Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer learning is an increasingly popular framework that enables beyond-5G distributed edge devices to collaboratively train deep neural networks in a privacy-preserving manner without the aid of a central server. Neural network training algorithms for emerging environments, e.g., smart cities, have many design considerations that are difficult to tune in deployment settings -- such as neural network architectures and hyperparameters. This presents a critical need for characterizing the training dynamics of distributed optimization algorithms used to train highly nonconvex neural networks in peer-to-peer learning environments. In this work, we provide an explicit, non-asymptotic characterization of the learning dynamics of wide neural networks trained using popular distributed gradient descent (DGD) algorithms. Our results leverage both recent advancements in neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and extensive previous work on distributed learning and consensus. We validate our analytical results by accurately predicting the parameter and error dynamics of wide neural networks trained for classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Style over Substance: Failure Modes of LLM Judges in Alignment Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 sparked an explosion of interest in post-training and an avalanche of new preference optimization (PO) methods. These methods claim superior alignment by virtue of better correspondence with human pairwise preferences, often measured by LLM judges. In this work, we attempt to answer the following question -- do LLM-judge preferences translate to progress on other, more concrete metrics for alignment, and if not, why not? We define a concrete metric for alignment, and introduce SOS-Bench, the largest standardized, reproducible LLM meta-benchmark to date. We find that (1) LLM-judgments do not correlate with concrete measures of safety, world knowledge, and instruction following; (2) LLM judges have powerful implicit biases, prioritizing style over factuality and safety; and (3) the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage of post-training, and not the PO stage, has the greatest impact on alignment, with data scaling and prompt diversity as the driving factors. Our codebase and complete results can be found at https://github.com/penfever/sos-bench.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the participation of team QUST in the SemEval2023 task 3. The monolingual models are first evaluated with the under-sampling of the majority classes in the early stage of the task. Then, the pre-trained multilingual model is fine-tuned with a combination of the class weights and the sample weights. Two different fine-tuning strategies, the task-agnostic and the task-dependent, are further investigated. All experiments are conducted under the 10-fold cross-validation, the multilingual approaches are superior to the monolingual ones. The submitted system achieves the second best in Italian and Spanish (zero-shot) in subtask-1.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Text Safety Classifiers through a Fairness-Aware Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing use of large language models (LLMs) demand performant guardrails to ensure the safety of inputs and outputs of LLMs. When these safeguards are trained on imbalanced data, they can learn the societal biases. We present a light-weight, post-processing method for mitigating counterfactual fairness in closed-source text safety classifiers. Our approach involves building an ensemble that not only outperforms the input classifiers and policy-aligns them, but also acts as a debiasing regularizer. We introduce two threshold-agnostic metrics to assess the counterfactual fairness of a model, and demonstrate how combining these metrics with Fair Data Reweighting (FDW) helps mitigate biases. We create an expanded Open AI dataset, and a new templated LLM-generated dataset based on user-prompts, both of which are counterfactually balanced across identity groups and cover four key areas of safety; we will work towards publicly releasing these datasets. Our results show that our approach improves counterfactual fairness with minimal impact on model performance.</description>

      <title>You can remove GPT2's LayerNorm by fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LayerNorm (LN) layer in GPT-style transformer models has long been a hindrance to mechanistic interpretability. LN is a crucial component required to stabilize the training of large language models, and LN or the similar RMSNorm have been used in practically all large language models based on the transformer architecture. The non-linear nature of the LN layers is a hindrance for mechanistic interpretability as it hinders interpretation of the residual stream, and makes it difficult to decompose the model into circuits. Some research have gone so far as to name "reasons interpretability researchers hate layer norm".
  In this paper we show that it is possible to remove the LN layers from a pre-trained GPT2-small model by fine-tuning on a fraction (500M tokens) of the training data. We demonstrate that this LN-free model achieves similar performance to the original model on the OpenWebText and ThePile datasets (-0.05 cross-entropy loss), and the Hellaswag benchmark (-0.5% accuracy). We provide the fine-tuning procedure and a Hugging Face repository with the fine-tuned GPT2-small models.
  Our work not only provides a simplified model for mechanistic interpretability research, but also provides evidence that the LN layers, at inference time, do not play a crucial role in transformer models.</description>

      <title>Sentiment Informed Sentence BERT-Ensemble Algorithm for Depression Detection</title>

Abstract: The World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed approximately 280 million people in the world suffer from depression. Yet, existing studies on early-stage depression detection using machine learning (ML) techniques are limited. Prior studies have applied a single stand-alone algorithm, which is unable to deal with data complexities, prone to overfitting, and limited in generalization. To this end, our paper examined the performance of several ML algorithms for early-stage depression detection using two benchmark social media datasets (D1 and D2). More specifically, we incorporated sentiment indicators to improve our model performance. Our experimental results showed that sentence bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (SBERT) numerical vectors fitted into the stacking ensemble model achieved comparable F1 scores of 69% in the dataset (D1) and 76% in the dataset (D2). Our findings suggest that utilizing sentiment indicators as an additional feature for depression detection yields an improved model performance, and thus, we recommend the development of a depressive term corpus for future work.</description>

      <title>TracrBench: Generating Interpretability Testbeds with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Achieving a mechanistic understanding of transformer-based language models is an open challenge, especially due to their large number of parameters. Moreover, the lack of ground truth mappings between model weights and their functional roles hinders the effective evaluation of interpretability methods, impeding overall progress. Tracr, a method for generating compiled transformers with inherent ground truth mappings in RASP, has been proposed to address this issue. However, manually creating a large number of models needed for verifying interpretability methods is labour-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we present a novel approach for generating interpretability test beds using large language models (LLMs) and introduce TracrBench, a novel dataset consisting of 121 manually written and LLM-generated, human-validated RASP programs and their corresponding transformer weights. During this process, we evaluate the ability of frontier LLMs to autonomously generate RASP programs and find that this task poses significant challenges. GPT-4-turbo, with a 20-shot prompt and best-of-5 sampling, correctly implements only 57 out of 101 test programs, necessitating the manual implementation of the remaining programs. With its 121 samples, TracrBench aims to serve as a valuable testbed for evaluating and comparing interpretability methods.</description>

      <title>Introducing MeMo: A Multimodal Dataset for Memory Modelling in Multiparty Conversations</title>

Abstract: The quality of human social relationships is intricately linked to human memory processes, with memory serving as the foundation for the creation of social bonds. Since human memory is selective, differing recollections of the same events within a group can lead to misunderstandings and misalignments in what is perceived to be common ground in the group. Yet, conversational facilitation systems, aimed at advancing the quality of group interactions, usually focus on tracking users' states within an individual session, ignoring what remains in each participant's memory after the interaction. Conversational memory is the process by which humans encode, retain and retrieve verbal, non-verbal and contextual information from a conversation. Understanding conversational memory can be used as a source of information on the long-term development of social connections within a group. This paper introduces the MeMo corpus, the first conversational dataset annotated with participants' memory retention reports, aimed at facilitating computational modelling of human conversational memory. The MeMo corpus includes 31 hours of small-group discussions on the topic of Covid-19, repeated over the term of 2 weeks. It integrates validated behavioural and perceptual measures, and includes audio, video, and multimodal annotations, offering a valuable resource for studying and modelling conversational memory and group dynamics. By introducing the MeMo corpus, presenting an analysis of its validity, and demonstrating its usefulness for future research, this paper aims to pave the way for future research in conversational memory modelling for intelligent system development.</description>

      <title>Logically Consistent Language Models via Neuro-Symbolic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a promising venue for natural language understanding and generation. However, current LLMs are far from reliable: they are prone to generating non-factual information and, more crucially, to contradicting themselves when prompted to reason about relations between entities of the world. These problems are currently addressed with large scale fine-tuning or by delegating reasoning to external tools. In this work, we strive for a middle ground and introduce a loss based on neuro-symbolic reasoning that teaches an LLM to be logically consistent with an external set of facts and rules and improves self-consistency even when the LLM is fine-tuned on a limited set of facts. Our approach also allows to easily combine multiple logical constraints at once in a principled way, delivering LLMs that are more consistent w.r.t. all constraints and improve over several baselines w.r.t. a given constraint. Moreover, our method allows LLMs to extrapolate to unseen but semantically similar factual knowledge, represented in unseen datasets, more systematically.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Dyadic Interaction Corpus NoXi+J: Toward Understanding Asian-European Non-verbal Cultural Characteristics and their Influences on Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-verbal behavior is a central challenge in understanding the dynamics of a conversation and the affective states between interlocutors arising from the interaction. Although psychological research has demonstrated that non-verbal behaviors vary across cultures, limited computational analysis has been conducted to clarify these differences and assess their impact on engagement recognition. To gain a greater understanding of engagement and non-verbal behaviors among a wide range of cultures and language spheres, in this study we conduct a multilingual computational analysis of non-verbal features and investigate their role in engagement and engagement prediction. To achieve this goal, we first expanded the NoXi dataset, which contains interaction data from participants living in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, by collecting session data of dyadic conversations in Japanese and Chinese, resulting in the enhanced dataset NoXi+J. Next, we extracted multimodal non-verbal features, including speech acoustics, facial expressions, backchanneling and gestures, via various pattern recognition techniques and algorithms. Then, we conducted a statistical analysis of listening behaviors and backchannel patterns to identify culturally dependent and independent features in each language and common features among multiple languages. These features were also correlated with the engagement shown by the interlocutors. Finally, we analyzed the influence of cultural differences in the input features of LSTM models trained to predict engagement for five language datasets. A SHAP analysis combined with transfer learning confirmed a considerable correlation between the importance of input features for a language set and the significant cultural characteristics analyzed.</description>

      <title>Rule Extrapolation in Language Models: A Study of Compositional Generalization on OOD Prompts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs show remarkable emergent abilities, such as inferring concepts from presumably out-of-distribution prompts, known as in-context learning. Though this success is often attributed to the Transformer architecture, our systematic understanding is limited. In complex real-world data sets, even defining what is out-of-distribution is not obvious. To better understand the OOD behaviour of autoregressive LLMs, we focus on formal languages, which are defined by the intersection of rules. We define a new scenario of OOD compositional generalization, termed rule extrapolation. Rule extrapolation describes OOD scenarios, where the prompt violates at least one rule. We evaluate rule extrapolation in formal languages with varying complexity in linear and recurrent architectures, the Transformer, and state space models to understand the architectures' influence on rule extrapolation. We also lay the first stones of a normative theory of rule extrapolation, inspired by the Solomonoff prior in algorithmic information theory.</description>

      <title>TopoChat: Enhancing Topological Materials Retrieval With Large Language Model and Multi-Source Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive performance in the text generation task, showing the ability to understand and respond to complex instructions. However, the performance of naive LLMs in speciffc domains is limited due to the scarcity of domain-speciffc corpora and specialized training. Moreover, training a specialized large-scale model necessitates signiffcant hardware resources, which restricts researchers from leveraging such models to drive advances. Hence, it is crucial to further improve and optimize LLMs to meet speciffc domain demands and enhance their scalability. Based on the condensed matter data center, we establish a material knowledge graph (MaterialsKG) and integrate it with literature. Using large language models and prompt learning, we develop a specialized dialogue system for topological materials called TopoChat. Compared to naive LLMs, TopoChat exhibits superior performance in structural and property querying, material recommendation, and complex relational reasoning. This system enables efffcient and precise retrieval of information and facilitates knowledge interaction, thereby encouraging the advancement on the ffeld of condensed matter materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of Clinical History on Predictive Model Performance for Renal Complications of Diabetes</title>

Abstract: Diabetes is a chronic disease characterised by a high risk of developing diabetic nephropathy, which, in turn, is the leading cause of end-stage chronic kidney disease. The early identification of individuals at heightened risk of such complications or their exacerbation can be of paramount importance to set a correct course of treatment. In the present work, from the data collected in the DARWIN-Renal (DApagliflozin Real-World evIdeNce-Renal) study, a nationwide multicentre retrospective real-world study, we develop an array of logistic regression models to predict, over different prediction horizons, the crossing of clinically relevant glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) thresholds for patients with diabetes by means of variables associated with demographic, anthropometric, laboratory, pathology, and therapeutic data. In doing so, we investigate the impact of information coming from patient's past visits on the model's predictive performance, coupled with an analysis of feature importance through the Boruta algorithm. Our models yield very good performance (AUROC as high as 0.98). We also show that the introduction of information from patient's past visits leads to improved model performance of up to 4%. The usefulness of past information is further corroborated by a feature importance analysis.</description>

Abstract: Prior Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), adapted from classification model attacks, fail due to ignoring the generative process of LLMs across token sequences. In this paper, we present a novel attack that adapts MIA statistical tests to the perplexity dynamics of subsequences within a data point. Our method significantly outperforms prior loss-based approaches, revealing context-dependent memorization patterns in pre-trained LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for enhancing confidence in anomaly detection in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) through the use of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture. By developing a confidence metric derived from latent space representations, we aim to improve the reliability of IDS predictions against cyberattacks. Applied to the NSL-KDD dataset, our approach focuses on binary classification tasks to effectively distinguish between normal and malicious network activities. The methodology demonstrates a significant enhancement in anomaly detection, evidenced by a notable correlation of 0.45 between the reconstruction error and the proposed metric. Our findings highlight the potential of employing VAEs for more accurate and trustworthy anomaly detection in network security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning typically integrates physical priors into the learning process by minimizing a loss function that includes both a data-driven term and a partial differential equation (PDE) regularization. Building on the formulation of the problem as a kernel regression task, we use Fourier methods to approximate the associated kernel, and propose a tractable estimator that minimizes the physics-informed risk function. We refer to this approach as physics-informed kernel learning (PIKL). This framework provides theoretical guarantees, enabling the quantification of the physical prior's impact on convergence speed. We demonstrate the numerical performance of the PIKL estimator through simulations, both in the context of hybrid modeling and in solving PDEs. In particular, we show that PIKL can outperform physics-informed neural networks in terms of both accuracy and computation time. Additionally, we identify cases where PIKL surpasses traditional PDE solvers, particularly in scenarios with noisy boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modality Conditioned Variational U-Net for Field-of-View Extension in Brain Diffusion MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An incomplete field-of-view (FOV) in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) can severely hinder the volumetric and bundle analyses of whole-brain white matter connectivity. Although existing works have investigated imputing the missing regions using deep generative models, it remains unclear how to specifically utilize additional information from paired multi-modality data and whether this can enhance the imputation quality and be useful for downstream tractography. To fill this gap, we propose a novel framework for imputing dMRI scans in the incomplete part of the FOV by integrating the learned diffusion features in the acquired part of the FOV to the complete brain anatomical structure. We hypothesize that by this design the proposed framework can enhance the imputation performance of the dMRI scans and therefore be useful for repairing whole-brain tractography in corrupted dMRI scans with incomplete FOV. We tested our framework on two cohorts from different sites with a total of 96 subjects and compared it with a baseline imputation method that treats the information from T1w and dMRI scans equally. The proposed framework achieved significant improvements in imputation performance, as demonstrated by angular correlation coefficient (p &lt; 1E-5), and in downstream tractography accuracy, as demonstrated by Dice score (p &lt; 0.01). Results suggest that the proposed framework improved imputation performance in dMRI scans by specifically utilizing additional information from paired multi-modality data, compared with the baseline method. The imputation achieved by the proposed framework enhances whole brain tractography, and therefore reduces the uncertainty when analyzing bundles associated with neurodegenerative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have become a machine learning workhorse for screening the chemical space of crystalline materials in fields such as catalysis and energy storage, by predicting properties from structures. Multicomponent materials, however, present a unique challenge since they can exhibit chemical (dis)order, where a given lattice structure can encompass a variety of elemental arrangements ranging from highly ordered structures to fully disordered solid solutions. Critically, properties like stability, strength, and catalytic performance depend not only on structures but also on orderings. To enable rigorous materials design, it is thus critical to ensure GCNNs are capable of distinguishing among atomic orderings. However, the ordering-aware capability of GCNNs has been poorly understood. Here, we benchmark various neural network architectures for capturing the ordering-dependent energetics of multicomponent materials in a custom-made dataset generated with high-throughput atomistic simulations. Conventional symmetry-invariant GCNNs were found unable to discern the structural difference between the diverse symmetrically inequivalent atomic orderings of the same material, while symmetry-equivariant model architectures could inherently preserve and differentiate the distinct crystallographic symmetries of various orderings.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Memorization in Large Language Models with Dynamic Soft Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as summarization, question answering, and translation. However, LLMs pose significant security risks due to their tendency to memorize training data, leading to potential privacy breaches and copyright infringement. Accurate measurement of this memorization is essential to evaluate and mitigate these potential risks. However, previous attempts to characterize memorization are constrained by either using prefixes only or by prepending a constant soft prompt to the prefixes, which cannot react to changes in input. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for estimating LLM memorization using dynamic, prefix-dependent soft prompts. Our approach involves training a transformer-based generator to produce soft prompts that adapt to changes in input, thereby enabling more accurate extraction of memorized data. Our method not only addresses the limitations of previous methods but also demonstrates superior performance in diverse experimental settings compared to state-of-the-art techniques. In particular, our method can achieve the maximum relative improvement of 112.75% and 32.26% over the vanilla baseline in terms of discoverable memorization rate for the text generation task and code generation task respectively.</description>

      <title>Learning to Simulate Aerosol Dynamics with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerosol effects on climate, weather, and air quality depend on characteristics of individual particles, which are tremendously diverse and change in time. Particle-resolved models are the only models able to capture this diversity in particle physiochemical properties, and these models are computationally expensive. As a strategy for accelerating particle-resolved microphysics models, we introduce Graph-based Learning of Aerosol Dynamics (GLAD) and use this model to train a surrogate of the particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC. GLAD implements a Graph Network-based Simulator (GNS), a machine learning framework that has been used to simulate particle-based fluid dynamics models. In GLAD, each particle is represented as a node in a graph, and the evolution of the particle population over time is simulated through learned message passing. We demonstrate our GNS approach on a simple aerosol system that includes condensation of sulfuric acid onto particles composed of sulfate, black carbon, organic carbon, and water. A graph with particles as nodes is constructed, and a graph neural network (GNN) is then trained using the model output from PartMC-MOSAIC. The trained GNN can then be used for simulating and predicting aerosol dynamics over time. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to accurately learn chemical dynamics and generalize across different scenarios, achieving efficient training and prediction times. We evaluate the performance across three scenarios, highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability in modeling aerosol microphysics and chemistry.</description>

      <title>MAGICS: Adversarial RL with Minimax Actors Guided by Implicit Critic Stackelberg for Convergent Neural Synthesis of Robot Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While robust optimal control theory provides a rigorous framework to compute robot control policies that are provably safe, it struggles to scale to high-dimensional problems, leading to increased use of deep learning for tractable synthesis of robot safety. Unfortunately, existing neural safety synthesis methods often lack convergence guarantees and solution interpretability. In this paper, we present Minimax Actors Guided by Implicit Critic Stackelberg (MAGICS), a novel adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that guarantees local convergence to a minimax equilibrium solution. We then build on this approach to provide local convergence guarantees for a general deep RL-based robot safety synthesis algorithm. Through both simulation studies on OpenAI Gym environments and hardware experiments with a 36-dimensional quadruped robot, we show that MAGICS can yield robust control policies outperforming the state-of-the-art neural safety synthesis methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Channel Squeeze U-Structure for Lung Nodule Detection and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep-learning method for the automatic detection and segmentation of lung nodules, aimed at advancing the accuracy of early-stage lung cancer diagnosis. The proposed approach leverages a unique "Channel Squeeze U-Structure" that optimizes feature extraction and information integration across multiple semantic levels of the network. This architecture includes three key modules: shallow information processing, channel residual structure, and channel squeeze integration. These modules enhance the model's ability to detect and segment small, imperceptible, or ground-glass nodules, which are critical for early diagnosis. The method demonstrates superior performance in terms of sensitivity, Dice similarity coefficient, precision, and mean Intersection over Union (IoU). Extensive experiments were conducted on the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset using five-fold cross-validation, showing excellent stability and robustness. The results indicate that this approach holds significant potential for improving computer-aided diagnosis systems, providing reliable support for radiologists in clinical practice and aiding in the early detection of lung cancer, especially in resource-limited settings</description>

      <title>Instruct-Tuning Pretrained Causal Language Models for Ancient Greek Papyrology and Epigraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an experiment in fine-tuning a pretrained causal language model (Meta's Llama 3.1 8B Instruct) for aiding in three fundamental tasks of philological research: chronological and geographic attribution as well as text restoration in ancient Greek inscriptions and documentary papyri. Using a prompt-based instruct approach, the fine-tuned models surpass the state of the art in key metrics. For inscriptions, the models achieve a lower average character error rate (CER) of 22.5% (vs. 26.3%), while closely matching top-1 accuracy (60.9% vs. 61.8%) and top-20 accuracy (77.5% vs. 78.3%) for sequences up to 10 characters. They also provide a practical advantage by ignoring spaces during reconstruction, aligning better with the scriptio continua typically used in ancient written artifacts. In geographic attribution, the model outperforms previous benchmarks with a top-1 accuracy of 75.0% (vs. 70.8%) and a top-3 accuracy of 83.7% (vs. 82.1%). For dating, it achieves an average deviation of 26.2 years (vs. 29.3) and a median deviation of 1 year (vs. 3) from the actual date range. The models also set new baselines for documentary papyri, with a CER of 16.3%, a top-1 accuracy of 71.3%, and top-20 of 85.0% in text reconstruction; a top-1 accuracy of 66.4% and top-3 of 79.9% in geographic attribution; and, in chronological attribution, a deviation of 21.7 years from the actual termini post/ante quem, with a median deviation of 0 years.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Passive Sonar Classification using Pre-trained Audio and ImageNet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning is commonly employed to leverage large, pre-trained models and perform fine-tuning for downstream tasks. The most prevalent pre-trained models are initially trained using ImageNet. However, their ability to generalize can vary across different data modalities. This study compares pre-trained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) and ImageNet pre-trained models within the context of underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR). It was observed that the ImageNet pre-trained models slightly out-perform pre-trained audio models in passive sonar classification. We also analyzed the impact of audio sampling rates for model pre-training and fine-tuning. This study contributes to transfer learning applications of UATR, illustrating the potential of pre-trained models to address limitations caused by scarce, labeled data in the UATR domain.</description>

Abstract: While deep learning has reduced the prevalence of manual feature extraction, transformation of data via feature engineering remains essential for improving model performance, particularly for underwater acoustic signals. The methods by which audio signals are converted into time-frequency representations and the subsequent handling of these spectrograms can significantly impact performance. This work demonstrates the performance impact of using different combinations of time-frequency features in a histogram layer time delay neural network. An optimal set of features is identified with results indicating that specific feature combinations outperform single data features.</description>

      <title>A Multi-LLM Debiasing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with the potential to benefit society immensely, yet, they have demonstrated biases that perpetuate societal inequalities. Despite significant advancements in bias mitigation techniques using data augmentation, zero-shot prompting, and model fine-tuning, biases continuously persist, including subtle biases that may elude human detection. Recent research has shown a growing interest in multi-LLM approaches, which have been demonstrated to be effective in improving the quality of reasoning and factuality in LLMs. Building on this approach, we propose a novel multi-LLM debiasing framework aimed at reducing bias in LLMs. Our work is the first to introduce and evaluate two distinct approaches within this framework for debiasing LLMs: a centralized method, where the conversation is facilitated by a single central LLM, and a decentralized method, where all models communicate directly. Our findings reveal that our multi-LLM framework significantly reduces bias in LLMs, outperforming the baseline method across several social groups.</description>

      <title>PTQ4ADM: Post-Training Quantization for Efficient Text Conditional Audio Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in generative tasks across image, audio, and video domains, producing high-quality, diverse, and contextually relevant data. However, their broader adoption is limited by high computational costs and large memory footprints. Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers a promising approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing model complexity through low-bandwidth parameters. Yet, direct application of PTQ to diffusion models can degrade synthesis quality due to accumulated quantization noise across multiple denoising steps, particularly in conditional tasks like text-to-audio synthesis. This work introduces PTQ4ADM, a novel framework for quantizing audio diffusion models(ADMs). Our key contributions include (1) a coverage-driven prompt augmentation method and (2) an activation-aware calibration set generation algorithm for text-conditional ADMs. These techniques ensure comprehensive coverage of audio aspects and modalities while preserving synthesis fidelity. We validate our approach on TANGO, Make-An-Audio, and AudioLDM models for text-conditional audio generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate PTQ4ADM's capability to reduce the model size by up to 70\% while achieving synthesis quality metrics comparable to full-precision models($&lt;$5\% increase in FD scores). We show that specific layers in the backbone network can be quantized to 4-bit weights and 8-bit activations without significant quality loss. This work paves the way for more efficient deployment of ADMs in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have been marked with the fast-pace diversification and increasing ubiquity of machine learning applications. Yet, a firm theoretical understanding of the surprising efficiency of neural networks to learn from high-dimensional data still proves largely elusive. In this endeavour, analyses inspired by statistical physics have proven instrumental, enabling the tight asymptotic characterization of the learning of neural networks in high dimensions, for a broad class of solvable models. This manuscript reviews the tools and ideas underlying recent progress in this line of work. We introduce a generic model -- the sequence multi-index model -- which encompasses numerous previously studied models as special instances. This unified framework covers a broad class of machine learning architectures with a finite number of hidden units, including multi-layer perceptrons, autoencoders, attention mechanisms; and tasks, including (un)supervised learning, denoising, contrastive learning, in the limit of large data dimension, and comparably large number of samples. We explicate in full detail the analysis of the learning of sequence multi-index models, using statistical physics techniques such as the replica method and approximate message-passing algorithms. This manuscript thus provides a unified presentation of analyses reported in several previous works, and a detailed overview of central techniques in the field of statistical physics of machine learning. This review should be a useful primer for machine learning theoreticians curious of statistical physics approaches; it should also be of value to statistical physicists interested in the transfer of such ideas to the study of neural networks.</description>

      <title>One Model is All You Need: ByT5-Sanskrit, a Unified Model for Sanskrit NLP Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morphologically rich languages are notoriously challenging to process for downstream NLP applications. This paper presents a new pretrained language model, ByT5-Sanskrit, designed for NLP applications involving the morphologically rich language Sanskrit. We evaluate ByT5-Sanskrit on established Sanskrit word segmentation tasks, where it outperforms previous data-driven approaches by a considerable margin and matches the performance of the current best lexicon-based model. It is easier to deploy and more robust to data not covered by external linguistic resources. It also achieves new state-of-the-art results in Vedic Sanskrit dependency parsing and OCR post-correction tasks. Additionally, based on the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit, we introduce a novel multitask dataset for the joint training of Sanskrit word segmentation, lemmatization, and morphosyntactic tagging tasks. We fine-tune ByT5-Sanskrit on this dataset, creating a versatile multitask model for various downstream Sanskrit applications. We have used this model in Sanskrit linguistic annotation projects, in information retrieval setups, and as a preprocessing step in a Sanskrit machine translation pipeline. We also show that our approach yields new best scores for lemmatization and dependency parsing of other morphologically rich languages. We thus demonstrate that byte-level pretrained language models can achieve excellent performance for morphologically rich languages, outperforming tokenizer-based models and presenting an important vector of exploration when constructing NLP pipelines for such languages.</description>

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of microscopy images is essential in the design and fabrication of components used in augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) modules. However, segmenting regions of interest (ROIs) from these complex images and extracting critical dimensions (CDs) requires novel techniques, such as deep learning models which are key for actionable decisions on process, material and device optimization. In this study, we report on the fine-tuning of a pre-trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) using a diverse dataset of electron microscopy images. We employed methods such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce training time and enhance the accuracy of ROI extraction. The model's ability to generalize to unseen images facilitates zero-shot learning and supports a CD extraction model that precisely extracts CDs from the segmented ROIs. We demonstrate the accurate extraction of binary images from cross-sectional images of surface relief gratings (SRGs) and Fresnel lenses in both single and multiclass modes. Furthermore, these binary images are used to identify transition points, aiding in the extraction of relevant CDs. The combined use of the fine-tuned segmentation model and the CD extraction model offers substantial advantages to various industrial applications by enhancing analytical capabilities, time to data and insights, and optimizing manufacturing processes.</description>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for large speech models have proven to be highly effective at ASR. With the interest in public deployment of large pre-trained models, there is a rising concern for unintended memorization and leakage of sensitive data points from the training data. In this paper, we apply differentially private (DP) pre-training to a SOTA Conformer-based encoder, and study its performance on a downstream ASR task assuming the fine-tuning data is public. This paper is the first to apply DP to SSL for ASR, investigating the DP noise tolerance of the BEST-RQ pre-training method. Notably, we introduce a novel variant of model pruning called gradient-based layer freezing that provides strong improvements in privacy-utility-compute trade-offs. Our approach yields a LibriSpeech test-clean/other WER (%) of 3.78/ 8.41 with ($10$, 1e^-9)-DP for extrapolation towards low dataset scales, and 2.81/ 5.89 with (10, 7.9e^-11)-DP for extrapolation towards high scales.</description>

      <title>ProTEA: Programmable Transformer Encoder Acceleration on FPGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNN) have been widely utilized on a diverse range of applications, including natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV). Their widespread adoption has been primarily driven by the exceptional performance of their multi-head self-attention block used to extract key features from sequential data. The multi-head self-attention block is followed by feedforward neural networks, which play a crucial role in introducing non-linearity to assist the model in learning complex patterns. Despite the popularity of TNNs, there has been limited numbers of hardware accelerators targeting these two critical blocks. Most prior works have concentrated on sparse architectures that are not flexible for popular TNN variants. This paper introduces \textit{ProTEA}, a runtime programmable accelerator tailored for the dense computations of most of state-of-the-art transformer encoders. \textit{ProTEA} is designed to reduce latency by maximizing parallelism. We introduce an efficient tiling of large matrices that can distribute memory and computing resources across different hardware components within the FPGA. We provide run time evaluations of \textit{ProTEA} on a Xilinx Alveo U55C high-performance data center accelerator card. Experimental results demonstrate that \textit{ProTEA} can host a wide range of popular transformer networks and achieve near optimal performance with a tile size of 64 in the multi-head self-attention block and 6 in the feedforward networks block when configured with 8 parallel attention heads, 12 layers, and an embedding dimension of 768 on the U55C. Comparative results are provided showing \textit{ProTEA} is 2.5$\times$ faster than an NVIDIA Titan XP GPU. Results also show that it achieves 1.3 -- 2.8$\times$ speed up compared with current state-of-the-art custom designed FPGA accelerators.</description>

      <title>ChemEval: A Comprehensive Multi-Level Chemical Evaluation for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the role that LLMs play in chemistry which lead to an increased focus on the development of LLMs benchmarks tailored to chemical domains to assess the performance of LLMs across a spectrum of chemical tasks varying in type and complexity. However, existing benchmarks in this domain fail to adequately meet the specific requirements of chemical research professionals. To this end, we propose \textbf{\textit{ChemEval}}, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of LLMs across a wide range of chemical domain tasks. Specifically, ChemEval identified 4 crucial progressive levels in chemistry, assessing 12 dimensions of LLMs across 42 distinct chemical tasks which are informed by open-source data and the data meticulously crafted by chemical experts, ensuring that the tasks have practical value and can effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs. In the experiment, we evaluate 12 mainstream LLMs on ChemEval under zero-shot and few-shot learning contexts, which included carefully selected demonstration examples and carefully designed prompts. The results show that while general LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 excel in literature understanding and instruction following, they fall short in tasks demanding advanced chemical knowledge. Conversely, specialized LLMs exhibit enhanced chemical competencies, albeit with reduced literary comprehension. This suggests that LLMs have significant potential for enhancement when tackling sophisticated tasks in the field of chemistry. We believe our work will facilitate the exploration of their potential to drive progress in chemistry. Our benchmark and analysis will be available at {\color{blue} \url{https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/ChemEval}}.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multivariate Time Series-based Solar Flare Prediction with Multifaceted Preprocessing and Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate solar flare prediction is crucial due to the significant risks that intense solar flares pose to astronauts, space equipment, and satellite communication systems. Our research enhances solar flare prediction by utilizing advanced data preprocessing and classification methods on a multivariate time series-based dataset of photospheric magnetic field parameters. First, our study employs a novel preprocessing pipeline that includes missing value imputation, normalization, balanced sampling, near decision boundary sample removal, and feature selection to significantly boost prediction accuracy. Second, we integrate contrastive learning with a GRU regression model to develop a novel classifier, termed ContReg, which employs dual learning methodologies, thereby further enhancing prediction performance. To validate the effectiveness of our preprocessing pipeline, we compare and demonstrate the performance gain of each step, and to demonstrate the efficacy of the ContReg classifier, we compare its performance to that of sequence-based deep learning architectures, machine learning models, and findings from previous studies. Our results illustrate exceptional True Skill Statistic (TSS) scores, surpassing previous methods and highlighting the critical role of precise data preprocessing and classifier development in time series-based solar flare prediction.</description>

      <title>FAMOUS: Flexible Accelerator for the Attention Mechanism of Transformer on UltraScale+ FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNNs) are being applied across a widening range of application domains, including natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV). Their popularity is largely attributed to the exceptional performance of their multi-head self-attention blocks when analyzing sequential data and extracting features. To date, there are limited hardware accelerators tailored for this mechanism, which is the first step before designing an accelerator for a complete model. This paper proposes \textit{FAMOUS}, a flexible hardware accelerator for dense multi-head attention (MHA) computation of TNNs on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). It is optimized for high utilization of processing elements and on-chip memories to improve parallelism and reduce latency. An efficient tiling of large matrices has been employed to distribute memory and computing resources across different modules on various FPGA platforms. The design is evaluated on Xilinx Alveo U55C and U200 data center cards containing Ultrascale+ FPGAs. Experimental results are presented that show that it can attain a maximum throughput, number of parallel attention heads, embedding dimension and tile size of 328 (giga operations/second (GOPS)), 8, 768 and 64 respectively on the U55C. Furthermore, it is 3.28$\times$ and 2.6$\times$ faster than the Intel Xeon Gold 5220R CPU and NVIDIA V100 GPU respectively. It is also 1.3$\times$ faster than the fastest state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerator.</description>

      <title>Temporally Consistent Factuality Probing for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prolific use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternate knowledge base requires them to be factually consistent, necessitating both correctness and consistency traits for paraphrased queries. Recently, significant attempts have been made to benchmark datasets and metrics to evaluate LLMs for these traits. However, structural simplicity (subject-relation-object) and contemporary association in their query formulation limit the broader definition of factuality and consistency. In this study, we introduce TeCFaP, a novel Temporally Consistent Factuality Probe task to expand the consistent factuality probe in the temporal dimension. To this end, we propose TEMP-COFAC, a high-quality dataset of prefix-style English query paraphrases. Subsequently, we extend the definitions of existing metrics to represent consistent factuality across temporal dimension. We experiment with a diverse set of LLMs and find most of them performing poorly on TeCFaP. Next, we propose a novel solution CoTSeLF (Consistent-Time-Sensitive Learning Framework) combining multi-task instruction tuning (MT-IT) with consistent-time-sensitive reinforcement learning (CTSRL) to improve temporally consistent factuality in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CoTSeLF over several baselines.</description>

      <title>KALIE: Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models for Open-World Manipulation without Robot Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building generalist robotic systems involves effectively endowing robots with the capabilities to handle novel objects in an open-world setting. Inspired by the advances of large pre-trained models, we propose Keypoint Affordance Learning from Imagined Environments (KALIE), which adapts pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) for robotic control in a scalable manner. Instead of directly producing motor commands, KALIE controls the robot by predicting point-based affordance representations based on natural language instructions and visual observations of the scene. The VLM is trained on 2D images with affordances labeled by humans, bypassing the need for training data collected on robotic systems. Through an affordance-aware data synthesis pipeline, KALIE automatically creates massive high-quality training data based on limited example data manually collected by humans. We demonstrate that KALIE can learn to robustly solve new manipulation tasks with unseen objects given only 50 example data points. Compared to baselines using pre-trained VLMs, our approach consistently achieves superior performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been several studies on automatically generating piano covers, and recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the creation of more sophisticated covers. However, existing automatic piano cover models still have room for improvement in terms of expressiveness and fidelity to the original. To address these issues, we propose a learning algorithm called AMT-APC, which leverages the capabilities of automatic music transcription models. By utilizing the strengths of well-established automatic music transcription models, we aim to improve the accuracy of piano cover generation. Our experiments demonstrate that the AMT-APC model reproduces original tracks more accurately than any existing models.</description>

      <title>BRep Boundary and Junction Detection for CAD Reverse Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In machining process, 3D reverse engineering of the mechanical system is an integral, highly important, and yet time consuming step to obtain parametric CAD models from 3D scans. Therefore, deep learning-based Scan-to-CAD modeling can offer designers enormous editability to quickly modify CAD model, being able to parse all its structural compositions and design steps. In this paper, we propose a supervised boundary representation (BRep) detection network BRepDetNet from 3D scans of CC3D and ABC dataset. We have carefully annotated the 50K and 45K scans of both the datasets with appropriate topological relations (e.g., next, mate, previous) between the geometrical primitives (i.e., boundaries, junctions, loops, faces) of their BRep data structures. The proposed solution decomposes the Scan-to-CAD problem in Scan-to-BRep ensuring the right step towards feature-based modeling, and therefore, leveraging other existing BRep-to-CAD modeling methods. Our proposed Scan-to-BRep neural network learns to detect BRep boundaries and junctions by minimizing focal-loss and non-maximal suppression (NMS) during training time. Experimental results show that our BRepDetNet with NMS-Loss achieves impressive results.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced stratification of Breast Cancer: exploring quantum expressivity for real omics data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is considered one of the most promising applications of Quantum Computing in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era for the impact it is thought to have in the near future. Although promising theoretical assumptions, the exploration of how QML could foster new discoveries in Medicine and Biology fields is still in its infancy with few examples. In this study, we aimed to assess whether Quantum Kernels (QK) could effectively classify subtypes of Breast Cancer (BC) patients on the basis of molecular characteristics. We performed an heuristic exploration of encoding configurations with different entanglement levels to determine a trade-off between kernel expressivity and performances. Our results show that QKs yield comparable clustering results with classical methods while using fewer data points, and are able to fit the data with a higher number of clusters. Additionally, we conducted the experiments on the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) to evaluate the effect of noise on the outcome. We found that less expressive encodings showed a higher resilience to noise, indicating that the computational pipeline can be reliably implemented on the NISQ devices. Our findings suggest that QK methods show promises for application in Precision Oncology, especially in scenarios where the dataset is limited in size and a granular non-trivial stratification of complex molecular data cannot be achieved classically.</description>

      <title>Obliviate: Neutralizing Task-agnostic Backdoors within the Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a key training strategy for large language models. However, its reliance on fewer trainable parameters poses security risks, such as task-agnostic backdoors. Despite their severe impact on a wide range of tasks, there is no practical defense solution available that effectively counters task-agnostic backdoors within the context of PEFT. In this study, we introduce Obliviate, a PEFT-integrable backdoor defense. We develop two techniques aimed at amplifying benign neurons within PEFT layers and penalizing the influence of trigger tokens. Our evaluations across three major PEFT architectures show that our method can significantly reduce the attack success rate of the state-of-the-art task-agnostic backdoors (83.6%$\downarrow$). Furthermore, our method exhibits robust defense capabilities against both task-specific backdoors and adaptive attacks. Source code will be obtained at https://github.com/obliviateARR/Obliviate.</description>

      <title>CONGRA: Benchmarking Automatic Conflict Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving conflicts from merging different software versions is a challenging task. To reduce the overhead of manual merging, researchers develop various program analysis-based tools which only solve specific types of conflicts and have a limited scope of application. With the development of language models, researchers treat conflict code as text, which theoretically allows for addressing almost all types of conflicts. However, the absence of effective conflict difficulty grading methods hinders a comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs), making it difficult to gain a deeper understanding of their limitations. Furthermore, there is a notable lack of large-scale open benchmarks for evaluating the performance of LLMs in automatic conflict resolution. To address these issues, we introduce ConGra, a CONflict-GRAded benchmarking scheme designed to evaluate the performance of software merging tools under varying complexity conflict scenarios. We propose a novel approach to classify conflicts based on code operations and use it to build a large-scale evaluation dataset based on 44,948 conflicts from 34 real-world projects. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on conflict resolution tasks using this dataset. By employing the dataset, we assess the performance of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and code LLMs, ultimately uncovering two counterintuitive yet insightful phenomena. ConGra will be released at https://github.com/HKU-System-Security-Lab/ConGra.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Effective Model Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model extraction aims to create a functionally similar copy from a machine learning as a service (MLaaS) API with minimal overhead, often for illicit purposes or as a precursor to further attacks, posing a significant threat to the MLaaS ecosystem. However, recent studies show that model extraction is inefficient, especially when the target task distribution is unavailable. In such cases, even significantly increasing the attack budget fails to yield a sufficiently similar model, reducing the adversary's incentive. In this paper, we revisit the basic design choices throughout the extraction process and propose an efficient and effective algorithm, Efficient and Effective Model Extraction (E3), which optimizes both query preparation and the training routine. E3 achieves superior generalization over state-of-the-art methods while minimizing computational costs. For example, with only 0.005 times the query budget and less than 0.2 times the runtime, E3 outperforms classical generative model-based data-free model extraction with over 50% absolute accuracy improvement on CIFAR-10. Our findings highlight the ongoing risk of model extraction and propose E3 as a useful benchmark for future security evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown remarkable success, especially in overparameterized or "large" models. Despite increasing empirical evidence and intuitive understanding, a formal mathematical justification for the behavior of such models, particularly regarding overfitting, remains incomplete. In this paper, we prove that the Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE) of neural networks with either $L^1$ or $L^2$ penalty decreases after a certain model size threshold, provided that the sample size is sufficiently large, and achieves nearly the minimax optimality in the Barron space. These results challenge conventional statistical modeling frameworks and broadens recent findings on the double descent phenomenon in neural networks. Our theoretical results also extend to deep learning models with ReLU activation functions.</description>

      <title>Present and Future Generalization of Synthetic Image Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continued release of new and better image generation models increases the demand for synthetic image detectors. In such a dynamic field, detectors need to be able to generalize widely and be robust to uncontrolled alterations. The present work is motivated by this setting, when looking at the role of time, image transformations and data sources, for detector generalization. In these experiments, none of the evaluated detectors is found universal, but results indicate an ensemble could be. Experiments on data collected in the wild show this task to be more challenging than the one defined by large-scale datasets, pointing to a gap between experimentation and actual practice. Finally, we observe a race equilibrium effect, where better generators lead to better detectors, and vice versa. We hypothesize this pushes the field towards a perpetually close race between generators and detectors.</description>

      <title>Are Music Foundation Models Better at Singing Voice Deepfake Detection? Far-Better Fuse them with Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, for the first time, we extensively investigate whether music foundation models (MFMs) or speech foundation models (SFMs) work better for singing voice deepfake detection (SVDD), which has recently attracted attention in the research community. For this, we perform a comprehensive comparative study of state-of-the-art (SOTA) MFMs (MERT variants and music2vec) and SFMs (pre-trained for general speech representation learning as well as speaker recognition). We show that speaker recognition SFM representations perform the best amongst all the foundation models (FMs), and this performance can be attributed to its higher efficacy in capturing the pitch, tone, intensity, etc, characteristics present in singing voices. To our end, we also explore the fusion of FMs for exploiting their complementary behavior for improved SVDD, and we propose a novel framework, FIONA for the same. With FIONA, through the synchronization of x-vector (speaker recognition SFM) and MERT-v1-330M (MFM), we report the best performance with the lowest Equal Error Rate (EER) of 13.74 %, beating all the individual FMs as well as baseline FM fusions and achieving SOTA results.</description>

      <title>On Importance of Pruning and Distillation for Efficient Low Resource NLP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of large transformer models has revolutionized Natural Language Processing, leading to significant advances in tasks like text classification. However, this progress demands substantial computational resources, escalating training duration, and expenses with larger model sizes. Efforts have been made to downsize and accelerate English models (e.g., Distilbert, MobileBert). Yet, research in this area is scarce for low-resource languages.
  In this study, we explore the case of the low-resource Indic language Marathi. Leveraging the marathi-topic-all-doc-v2 model as our baseline, we implement optimization techniques to reduce computation time and memory usage. Our focus is on enhancing the efficiency of Marathi transformer models while maintaining top-tier accuracy and reducing computational demands. Using the MahaNews document classification dataset and the marathi-topic-all-doc-v2 model from L3Cube, we apply Block Movement Pruning, Knowledge Distillation, and Mixed Precision methods individually and in combination to boost efficiency. We demonstrate the importance of strategic pruning levels in achieving desired efficiency gains. Furthermore, we analyze the balance between efficiency improvements and environmental impact, highlighting how optimized model architectures can contribute to a more sustainable computational ecosystem. Implementing these techniques on a single GPU system, we determine that the optimal configuration is 25\% pruning + knowledge distillation. This approach yielded a 2.56x speedup in computation time while maintaining baseline accuracy levels.</description>

      <title>PromptTA: Prompt-driven Text Adapter for Source-free Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Source-free domain generalization (SFDG) tackles the challenge of adapting models to unseen target domains without access to source domain data. To deal with this challenging task, recent advances in SFDG have primarily focused on leveraging the text modality of vision-language models such as CLIP. These methods involve developing a transferable linear classifier based on diverse style features extracted from the text and learned prompts or deriving domain-unified text representations from domain banks. However, both style features and domain banks have limitations in capturing comprehensive domain knowledge. In this work, we propose Prompt-Driven Text Adapter (PromptTA) method, which is designed to better capture the distribution of style features and employ resampling to ensure thorough coverage of domain knowledge. To further leverage this rich domain information, we introduce a text adapter that learns from these style features for efficient domain information storage. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that PromptTA achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/zhanghr2001/PromptTA.</description>

      <title>Will Large Language Models be a Panacea to Autonomous Driving?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD) research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency. Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths: modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules, the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.</description>

      <title>Towards Building Efficient Sentence BERT Models using Layer Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of layer pruning in creating efficient Sentence BERT (SBERT) models. Our goal is to create smaller sentence embedding models that reduce complexity while maintaining strong embedding similarity. We assess BERT models like Muril and MahaBERT-v2 before and after pruning, comparing them with smaller, scratch-trained models like MahaBERT-Small and MahaBERT-Smaller. Through a two-phase SBERT fine-tuning process involving Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), we evaluate the impact of layer reduction on embedding quality. Our findings show that pruned models, despite fewer layers, perform competitively with fully layered versions. Moreover, pruned models consistently outperform similarly sized, scratch-trained models, establishing layer pruning as an effective strategy for creating smaller, efficient embedding models. These results highlight layer pruning as a practical approach for reducing computational demand while preserving high-quality embeddings, making SBERT models more accessible for languages with limited technological resources.</description>

      <title>QMOS: Enhancing LLMs for Telecommunication with Question Masked loss and Option Shuffling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have brought about substantial advancements in the field of Question Answering (QA) systems. These models do remarkably well in addressing intricate inquiries in a variety of disciplines. However, because of domain-specific vocabulary, complex technological concepts, and the requirement for exact responses applying LLMs to specialized sectors like telecommunications presents additional obstacles. GPT-3.5 has been used in recent work, to obtain noteworthy accuracy for telecom-related questions in a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Notwithstanding these developments, the practical use of models such as GPT-3.5 is restricted by their proprietary nature and high computing demands. This paper introduces QMOS, an innovative approach which uses a Question-Masked loss and Option Shuffling trick to enhance the performance of LLMs in answering Multiple-Choice Questions in the telecommunications domain. Our focus was on using opensource, smaller language models (Phi-2 and Falcon-7B) within an enhanced RAG framework. Our multi-faceted approach involves several enhancements to the whole LLM-RAG pipeline of finetuning, retrieval, prompt engineering and inference. Our approaches significantly outperform existing results, achieving accuracy improvements from baselines of 24.70% to 49.30% with Falcon-7B and from 42.07% to 84.65% with Phi-2.</description>

      <title>Data-centric NLP Backdoor Defense from the Lens of Memorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attack is a severe threat to the trustworthiness of DNN-based language models. In this paper, we first extend the definition of memorization of language models from sample-wise to more fine-grained sentence element-wise (e.g., word, phrase, structure, and style), and then point out that language model backdoors are a type of element-wise memorization. Through further analysis, we find that the strength of such memorization is positively correlated to the frequency of duplicated elements in the training dataset. In conclusion, duplicated sentence elements are necessary for successful backdoor attacks. Based on this, we propose a data-centric defense. We first detect trigger candidates in training data by finding memorizable elements, i.e., duplicated elements, and then confirm real triggers by testing if the candidates can activate backdoor behaviors (i.e., malicious elements). Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in defending against different types of NLP backdoors.</description>

      <title>R-AIF: Solving Sparse-Reward Robotic Tasks from Pixels with Active Inference and World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although research has produced promising results demonstrating the utility of active inference (AIF) in Markov decision processes (MDPs), there is relatively less work that builds AIF models in the context of environments and problems that take the form of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). In POMDP scenarios, the agent must infer the unobserved environmental state from raw sensory observations, e.g., pixels in an image. Additionally, less work exists in examining the most difficult form of POMDP-centered control: continuous action space POMDPs under sparse reward signals. In this work, we address issues facing the AIF modeling paradigm by introducing novel prior preference learning techniques and self-revision schedules to help the agent excel in sparse-reward, continuous action, goal-based robotic control POMDP environments. Empirically, we show that our agents offer improved performance over state-of-the-art models in terms of cumulative rewards, relative stability, and success rate. The code in support of this work can be found at https://github.com/NACLab/robust-active-inference.</description>

      <title>Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) for solving physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) more accurately, robustly and faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important and essential component in many scientific and engineering discoveries. One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using "square of ReLU" as the basis of its activation functions has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higher-order-ReLU, which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, B-splines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential for physics-informed neural networks. Our detailed experiments on two standard and typical PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLUKANs and HRKANs.</description>

      <title>FeDETR: a Federated Approach for Stenosis Detection in Coronary Angiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the severity of stenoses in coronary angiography is critical to the patient's health, as coronary stenosis is an underlying factor in heart failure. Current practice for grading coronary lesions, i.e. fractional flow reserve (FFR) or instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR), suffers from several drawbacks, including time, cost and invasiveness, alongside potential interobserver variability. In this context, some deep learning methods have emerged to assist cardiologists in automating the estimation of FFR/iFR values. Despite the effectiveness of these methods, their reliance on large datasets is challenging due to the distributed nature of sensitive medical data. Federated learning addresses this challenge by aggregating knowledge from multiple nodes to improve model generalization, while preserving data privacy. We propose the first federated detection transformer approach, FeDETR, to assess stenosis severity in angiography videos based on FFR/iFR values estimation. In our approach, each node trains a detection transformer (DETR) on its local dataset, with the central server federating the backbone part of the network. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on a dataset collected from five hospitals, consisting of 1001 angiographic examinations, and its performance is compared with state-of-the-art federated learning methods.</description>

      <title>Proof Automation with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive theorem provers such as Coq are powerful tools to formally guarantee the correctness of software. However, using these tools requires significant manual effort and expertise. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automatically generating informal proofs in natural language, they are less effective at generating formal proofs in interactive theorem provers. In this paper, we conduct a formative study to identify common mistakes made by LLMs when asked to generate formal proofs. By analyzing 520 proof generation errors made by GPT-3.5, we found that GPT-3.5 often identified the correct high-level structure of a proof, but struggled to get the lower-level details correct. Based on this insight, we propose PALM, a novel generate-then-repair approach that first prompts an LLM to generate an initial proof and then leverages targeted symbolic methods to iteratively repair low-level problems. We evaluate PALM on a large dataset that includes more than 10K theorems. Our results show that PALM significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, successfully proving 76.6% to 180.4% more theorems. Moreover, PALM proves 1270 theorems beyond the reach of existing approaches. We also demonstrate the generalizability of PALM across different LLMs.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Stochastic ExtraGradient: Mixing Hessian and Gradient Similarity to Reduce Communication in Distributed and Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern realities and trends in learning require more and more generalization ability of models, which leads to an increase in both models and training sample size. It is already difficult to solve such tasks in a single device mode. This is the reason why distributed and federated learning approaches are becoming more popular every day. Distributed computing involves communication between devices, which requires solving two key problems: efficiency and privacy. One of the most well-known approaches to combat communication costs is to exploit the similarity of local data. Both Hessian similarity and homogeneous gradients have been studied in the literature, but separately. In this paper, we combine both of these assumptions in analyzing a new method that incorporates the ideas of using data similarity and clients sampling. Moreover, to address privacy concerns, we apply the technique of additional noise and analyze its impact on the convergence of the proposed method. The theory is confirmed by training on real datasets.</description>

      <title>A competitive baseline for deep learning enhanced data assimilation using conditional Gaussian ensemble Kalman filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) is a popular technique for data assimilation, with far ranging applications. However, the vanilla EnKF framework is not well-defined when perturbations are nonlinear. We study two non-linear extensions of the vanilla EnKF - dubbed the conditional-Gaussian EnKF (CG-EnKF) and the normal score EnKF (NS-EnKF) - which sidestep assumptions of linearity by constructing the Kalman gain matrix with the `conditional Gaussian' update formula in place of the traditional one. We then compare these models against a state-of-the-art deep learning based particle filter called the score filter (SF). This model uses an expensive score diffusion model for estimating densities and also requires a strong assumption on the perturbation operator for validity. In our comparison, we find that CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF dramatically outperform SF for a canonical problem in high-dimensional multiscale data assimilation given by the Lorenz-96 system. Our analysis also demonstrates that the CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF can handle highly non-Gaussian additive noise perturbations, with the latter typically outperforming the former.</description>

However, their performance in narrative reasoning, which demands greater abstraction capabilities, remains unexplored. This study utilizes tropes in movie synopses to assess the abstract reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs and uncovers their low performance. We introduce a trope-wise querying approach to address these challenges and boost the F1 score by 11.8 points. Moreover, while prior studies suggest that CoT enhances multi-step reasoning, this study shows CoT can cause hallucinations in narrative content, reducing GPT-4's performance. We also introduce an Adversarial Injection method to embed trope-related text tokens into movie synopses without explicit tropes, revealing CoT's heightened sensitivity to such injections. Our comprehensive analysis provides insights for future research directions.</description>

Abstract: Speech sounds convey a great deal of information about the scenes, resulting in a variety of effects ranging from reverberation to additional ambient sounds. In this paper, we manipulate input speech to sound as though it was recorded within a different scene, given an audio-visual conditional example recorded from that scene. Our model learns through self-supervision, taking advantage of the fact that natural video contains recurring sound events and textures. We extract an audio clip from a video and apply speech enhancement. We then train a latent diffusion model to recover the original speech, using another audio-visual clip taken from elsewhere in the video as a conditional hint. Through this process, the model learns to transfer the conditional example's sound properties to the input speech. We show that our model can be successfully trained using unlabeled, in-the-wild videos, and that an additional visual signal can improve its sound prediction abilities.

      <title>A Feature Engineering Approach for Literary and Colloquial Tamil Speech Classification using 1D-CNN</title>

Abstract: In ideal human computer interaction (HCI), the colloquial form of a language would be preferred by most users, since it is the form used in their day-to-day conversations. However, there is also an undeniable necessity to preserve the formal literary form. By embracing the new and preserving the old, both service to the common man (practicality) and service to the language itself (conservation) can be rendered. Hence, it is ideal for computers to have the ability to accept, process, and converse in both forms of the language, as required. To address this, it is first necessary to identify the form of the input speech, which in the current work is between literary and colloquial Tamil speech. Such a front-end system must consist of a simple, effective, and lightweight classifier that is trained on a few effective features that are capable of capturing the underlying patterns of the speech signal. To accomplish this, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) that learns the envelope of features across time, is proposed. The network is trained on a select number of handcrafted features initially, and then on Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) for comparison. The handcrafted features were selected to address various aspects of speech such as the spectral and temporal characteristics, prosody, and voice quality. The features are initially analyzed by considering ten parallel utterances and observing the trend of each feature with respect to time. The proposed 1D-CNN, trained using the handcrafted features, offers an F1 score of 0.9803, while that trained on the MFCC offers an F1 score of 0.9895. In light of this, feature ablation and feature combination are explored. When the best ranked handcrafted features, from the feature ablation study, are combined with the MFCC, they offer the best results with an F1 score of 0.9946.</description>

      <title>Using Natural Language Processing to find Indication for Burnout with Text Classification: From Online Data to Real-World Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burnout, classified as a syndrome in the ICD-11, arises from chronic workplace stress that has not been effectively managed. It is characterized by exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy, and estimates of its prevalence vary significantly due to inconsistent measurement methods. Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning offer promising tools for detecting burnout through textual data analysis, with studies demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This paper contributes to burnout detection in German texts by: (a) collecting an anonymous real-world dataset including free-text answers and Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) responses; (b) demonstrating the limitations of a GermanBERT-based classifier trained on online data; (c) presenting two versions of a curated BurnoutExpressions dataset, which yielded models that perform well in real-world applications; and (d) providing qualitative insights from an interdisciplinary focus group on the interpretability of AI models used for burnout detection. Our findings emphasize the need for greater collaboration between AI researchers and clinical experts to refine burnout detection models. Additionally, more real-world data is essential to validate and enhance the effectiveness of current AI methods developed in NLP research, which are often based on data automatically scraped from online sources and not evaluated in a real-world context. This is essential for ensuring AI tools are well suited for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Investigating Layer Importance in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention due to their prominent ability to understand and process texts. Nevertheless, LLMs largely remain opaque. The lack of understanding of LLMs has obstructed the deployment in safety-critical scenarios and hindered the development of better models. In this study, we advance the understanding of LLM by investigating the significance of individual layers in LLMs. We propose an efficient sampling method to faithfully evaluate the importance of layers using Shapley values, a widely used explanation framework in feature attribution and data valuation. In addition, we conduct layer ablation experiments to assess the performance degradation resulting from the exclusion of specific layers. Our findings reveal the existence of cornerstone layers, wherein certain early layers can exhibit a dominant contribution over others. Removing one cornerstone layer leads to a drastic collapse of the model performance, often reducing it to random guessing. Conversely, removing non-cornerstone layers results in only marginal performance changes. This study identifies cornerstone layers in LLMs and underscores their critical role for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malware visualization analysis incorporating with Machine Learning (ML) has been proven to be a promising solution for improving security defenses on different platforms. In this work, we propose an integrated framework for addressing common problems experienced by ML utilizers in developing malware detection systems. Namely, a pictorial presentation system with extensions is designed to preserve the identities of benign/malign samples by encoding each variable into binary digits and mapping them into black and white pixels. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network based model is adopted to produce synthetic images and mitigate issues of imbalance classes. Detection models architected by Convolutional Neural Networks are for validating performances while training on datasets with and without artifactual samples. Result demonstrates accuracy rates of 98.51% and 97.26% for these two training scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach for Learning the Dynamics of Power System Generators and Inverter-based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of inverter-based resources (IBRs) for renewable energy integration and electrification greatly challenges power system dynamic analysis. To account for both synchronous generators (SGs) and IBRs, this work presents an approach for learning the model of an individual dynamic component. The recurrent neural network (RNN) model is used to match the recursive structure in predicting the key dynamical states of a component from its terminal bus voltage and set-point input. To deal with the fast transients especially due to IBRs, we develop a Stable Integral (SI-)RNN to mimic high-order integral methods that can enhance the stability and accuracy for the dynamic learning task. We demonstrate that the proposed SI-RNN model not only can successfully predict the component's dynamic behaviors, but also offers the possibility of efficiently computing the dynamic sensitivity relative to a set-point change. These capabilities have been numerically validated based on full-order Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulations on a small test system with both SGs and IBRs, particularly for predicting the dynamics of grid-forming inverters.</description>

      <title>A High-Performance External Validity Index for Clustering with a Large Number of Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Stable Matching Based Pairing (SMBP) algorithm, a high-performance external validity index for clustering evaluation in large-scale datasets with a large number of clusters. SMBP leverages the stable matching framework to pair clusters across different clustering methods, significantly reducing computational complexity to $O(N^2)$, compared to traditional Maximum Weighted Matching (MWM) with $O(N^3)$ complexity. Through comprehensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic datasets, SMBP demonstrates comparable accuracy to MWM and superior computational efficiency. It is particularly effective for balanced, unbalanced, and large-scale datasets with a large number of clusters, making it a scalable and practical solution for modern clustering tasks. Additionally, SMBP is easily implementable within machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, offering a robust tool for big data applications. The algorithm is validated through extensive experiments, showcasing its potential as a powerful alternative to existing methods such as Maximum Match Measure (MMM) and Centroid Ratio (CR).</description>

      <title>Exploring Multilingual Probing in Large Language Models: A Cross-Language Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing techniques for large language models (LLMs) have primarily focused on English, overlooking the vast majority of the world's languages. In this paper, we extend these probing methods to a multilingual context, investigating the behaviors of LLMs across diverse languages. We conduct experiments on several open-source LLM models, analyzing probing accuracy, trends across layers, and similarities between probing vectors for multiple languages. Our key findings reveal: (1) a consistent performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages, with high-resource languages achieving significantly higher probing accuracy; (2) divergent layer-wise accuracy trends, where high-resource languages show substantial improvement in deeper layers similar to English; and (3) higher representational similarities among high-resource languages, with low-resource languages demonstrating lower similarities both among themselves and with high-resource languages. These results highlight significant disparities in LLMs' multilingual capabilities and emphasize the need for improved modeling of low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>SynBench: A Synthetic Benchmark for Non-rigid 3D Point Cloud Registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-rigid point cloud registration is a crucial task in computer vision. Evaluating a non-rigid point cloud registration method requires a dataset with challenges such as large deformation levels, noise, outliers, and incompleteness. Despite the existence of several datasets for deformable point cloud registration, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark with all challenges makes it difficult to achieve fair evaluations among different methods. This paper introduces SynBench, a new non-rigid point cloud registration dataset created using SimTool, a toolset for soft body simulation in Flex and Unreal Engine. SynBench provides the ground truth of corresponding points between two point sets and encompasses key registration challenges, including varying levels of deformation, noise, outliers, and incompleteness. To the best of the authors' knowledge, compared to existing datasets, SynBench possesses three particular characteristics: (1) it is the first benchmark that provides various challenges for non-rigid point cloud registration, (2) SynBench encompasses challenges of varying difficulty levels, and (3) it includes ground truth corresponding points both before and after deformation. The authors believe that SynBench enables future non-rigid point cloud registration methods to present a fair comparison of their achievements. SynBench is publicly available at: https://doi.org/10.11588/data/R9IKCF.</description>

Abstract: Creating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that are robust and resilient to classroom conditions is paramount to the development of AI tools to aid teachers and students. In this work, we study the efficacy of continued pretraining (CPT) in adapting Wav2vec2.0 to the classroom domain. We show that CPT is a powerful tool in that regard and reduces the Word Error Rate (WER) of Wav2vec2.0-based models by upwards of 10%. More specifically, CPT improves the model's robustness to different noises, microphones and classroom conditions.</description>

      <title>SPAQ-DL-SLAM: Towards Optimizing Deep Learning-based SLAM for Resource-Constrained Embedded Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing Deep Learning-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (DL-SLAM) algorithms is essential for efficient implementation on resource-constrained embedded platforms, enabling real-time on-board computation in autonomous mobile robots. This paper presents SPAQ-DL-SLAM, a framework that strategically applies Structured Pruning and Quantization (SPAQ) to the architecture of one of the state-ofthe-art DL-SLAM algorithms, DROID-SLAM, for resource and energy-efficiency. Specifically, we perform structured pruning with fine-tuning based on layer-wise sensitivity analysis followed by 8-bit post-training static quantization (PTQ) on the deep learning modules within DROID-SLAM. Our SPAQ-DROIDSLAM model, optimized version of DROID-SLAM model using our SPAQ-DL-SLAM framework with 20% structured pruning and 8-bit PTQ, achieves an 18.9% reduction in FLOPs and a 79.8% reduction in overall model size compared to the DROID-SLAM model. Our evaluations on the TUM-RGBD benchmark shows that SPAQ-DROID-SLAM model surpasses the DROID-SLAM model by an average of 10.5% on absolute trajectory error (ATE) metric. Additionally, our results on the ETH3D SLAM training benchmark demonstrate enhanced generalization capabilities of the SPAQ-DROID-SLAM model, seen by a higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) score and success in 2 additional data sequences compared to the DROIDSLAM model. Despite these improvements, the model exhibits performance variance on the distinct Vicon Room sequences from the EuRoC dataset, which are captured at high angular velocities. This varying performance at some distinct scenarios suggests that designing DL-SLAM algorithms taking operating environments and tasks in consideration can achieve optimal performance and resource efficiency for deployment in resource-constrained embedded platforms.</description>

      <title>Sliding Window Training -- Utilizing Historical Recommender Systems Data for Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-lived recommender systems (RecSys) often encounter lengthy user-item interaction histories that span many years. To effectively learn long term user preferences, Large RecSys foundation models (FM) need to encode this information in pretraining. Usually, this is done by either generating a long enough sequence length to take all history sequences as input at the cost of large model input dimension or by dropping some parts of the user history to accommodate model size and latency requirements on the production serving side. In this paper, we introduce a sliding window training technique to incorporate long user history sequences during training time without increasing the model input dimension. We show the quantitative &amp; qualitative improvements this technique brings to the RecSys FM in learning user long term preferences. We additionally show that the average quality of items in the catalog learnt in pretraining also improves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel representation named as the unified gripper coordinate space for grasp synthesis of multiple grippers. The space is a 2D surface of a sphere in 3D using longitude and latitude as its coordinates, and it is shared for all robotic grippers. We propose a new algorithm to map the palm surface of a gripper into the unified gripper coordinate space, and design a conditional variational autoencoder to predict the unified gripper coordinates given an input object. The predicted unified gripper coordinates establish correspondences between the gripper and the object, which can be used in an optimization problem to solve the grasp pose and the finger joints for grasp synthesis. We demonstrate that using the unified gripper coordinate space improves the success rate and diversity in the grasp synthesis of multiple grippers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately detecting and tracking high-speed, small objects, such as balls in sports videos, is challenging due to factors like motion blur and occlusion. Although recent deep learning frameworks like TrackNetV1, V2, and V3 have advanced tennis ball and shuttlecock tracking, they often struggle in scenarios with partial occlusion or low visibility. This is primarily because these models rely heavily on visual features without explicitly incorporating motion information, which is crucial for precise tracking and trajectory prediction. In this paper, we introduce an enhancement to the TrackNet family by fusing high-level visual features with learnable motion attention maps through a motion-aware fusion mechanism, effectively emphasizing the moving ball's location and improving tracking performance. Our approach leverages frame differencing maps, modulated by a motion prompt layer, to highlight key motion regions over time. Experimental results on the tennis ball and shuttlecock datasets show that our method enhances the tracking performance of both TrackNetV2 and V3. We refer to our lightweight, plug-and-play solution, built on top of the existing TrackNet, as TrackNetV4.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Exogenous Structure for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) known as Exo-MDPs, characterized by a partition of the state space into two components. The exogenous states evolve stochastically in a manner not affected by the agent's actions, whereas the endogenous states are affected by the actions, and evolve in a deterministic and known way conditional on the exogenous states. Exo-MDPs are a natural model for various applications including inventory control, finance, power systems, ride sharing, among others. Despite seeming restrictive, this work establishes that any discrete MDP can be represented as an Exo-MDP. Further, Exo-MDPs induce a natural representation of the transition and reward dynamics as linear functions of the exogenous state distribution. This linear representation leads to near-optimal algorithms with regret guarantees scaling only with the (effective) size of the exogenous state space $d$, independent of the sizes of the endogenous state and action spaces. Specifically, when the exogenous state is fully observed, a simple plug-in approach achieves a regret upper bound of $O(H^{3/2}\sqrt{dK})$, where $H$ denotes the horizon and $K$ denotes the total number of episodes. When the exogenous state is unobserved, the linear representation leads to a regret upper bound of $O(H^{3/2}d\sqrt{K})$. We also establish a nearly matching regret lower bound of $\Omega(Hd\sqrt{K})$ for the no observation regime. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental study on inventory control problems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Feature Selection with Genetic Algorithms: A Review of Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing large datasets to select optimal features is one of the most important research areas in machine learning and data mining. This feature selection procedure involves dimensionality reduction which is crucial in enhancing the performance of the model, making it less complex. Recently, several types of attribute selection methods have been proposed that use different approaches to obtain representative subsets of the attributes. However, population-based evolutionary algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been proposed to provide remedies for these drawbacks by avoiding local optima and improving the selection process itself. This manuscript presents a sweeping review on GA-based feature selection techniques in applications and their effectiveness across different domains. This review was conducted using the PRISMA methodology; hence, the systematic identification, screening, and analysis of relevant literature were performed. Thus, our results hint that the field's hybrid GA methodologies including, but not limited to, GA-Wrapper feature selector and HGA-neural networks, have substantially improved their potential through the resolution of problems such as exploration of unnecessary search space, accuracy performance problems, and complexity. The conclusions of this paper would result in discussing the potential that GAs bear in feature selection and future research directions for their enhancement in applicability and performance.</description>

      <title>Combating Spatial Disorientation in a Dynamic Self-Stabilization Task Using AI Assistants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial disorientation is a leading cause of fatal aircraft accidents. This paper explores the potential of AI agents to aid pilots in maintaining balance and preventing unrecoverable losses of control by offering cues and corrective measures that ameliorate spatial disorientation. A multi-axis rotation system (MARS) was used to gather data from human subjects self-balancing in a spaceflight analog condition. We trained models over this data to create "digital twins" that exemplified performance characteristics of humans with different proficiency levels. We then trained various reinforcement learning and deep learning models to offer corrective cues if loss of control is predicted. Digital twins and assistant models then co-performed a virtual inverted pendulum (VIP) programmed with identical physics. From these simulations, we picked the 5 best-performing assistants based on task metrics such as crash frequency and mean distance from the direction of balance. These were used in a co-performance study with 20 new human subjects performing a version of the VIP task with degraded spatial information. We show that certain AI assistants were able to improve human performance and that reinforcement-learning based assistants were objectively more effective but rated as less trusted and preferable by humans.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Performance and Robustness of LLMs in Materials Science Q&amp;A and Property Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize scientific research, yet their robustness and reliability in domain-specific applications remain insufficiently explored. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation and robustness analysis of LLMs within the field of materials science, focusing on domain-specific question answering and materials property prediction. Three distinct datasets are used in this study: 1) a set of multiple-choice questions from undergraduate-level materials science courses, 2) a dataset including various steel compositions and yield strengths, and 3) a band gap dataset, containing textual descriptions of material crystal structures and band gap values. The performance of LLMs is assessed using various prompting strategies, including zero-shot chain-of-thought, expert prompting, and few-shot in-context learning. The robustness of these models is tested against various forms of 'noise', ranging from realistic disturbances to intentionally adversarial manipulations, to evaluate their resilience and reliability under real-world conditions. Additionally, the study uncovers unique phenomena of LLMs during predictive tasks, such as mode collapse behavior when the proximity of prompt examples is altered and performance enhancement from train/test mismatch. The findings aim to provide informed skepticism for the broad use of LLMs in materials science and to inspire advancements that enhance their robustness and reliability for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Medical Concept Normalization in a Low-Resource Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of biomedical natural language processing, medical concept normalization is a crucial task for accurately mapping mentions of concepts to a large knowledge base. However, this task becomes even more challenging in low-resource settings, where limited data and resources are available. In this thesis, I explore the challenges of medical concept normalization in a low-resource setting. Specifically, I investigate the shortcomings of current medical concept normalization methods applied to German lay texts. Since there is no suitable dataset available, a dataset consisting of posts from a German medical online forum is annotated with concepts from the Unified Medical Language System. The experiments demonstrate that multilingual Transformer-based models are able to outperform string similarity methods. The use of contextual information to improve the normalization of lay mentions is also examined, but led to inferior results. Based on the results of the best performing model, I present a systematic error analysis and lay out potential improvements to mitigate frequent errors.</description>

      <title>EchoAtt: Attend, Copy, then Adjust for More Efficient Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their increasing depth and number of parameters, have demonstrated outstanding performance across a variety of natural language processing tasks. However, this growth in scale leads to increased computational demands, particularly during inference and fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we introduce EchoAtt, a novel framework aimed at optimizing transformer-based models by analyzing and leveraging the similarity of attention patterns across layers. Our analysis reveals that many inner layers in LLMs, especially larger ones, exhibit highly similar attention matrices. By exploiting this similarity, EchoAtt enables the sharing of attention matrices in less critical layers, significantly reducing computational requirements without compromising performance. We incorporate this approach within a knowledge distillation setup, where a pre-trained teacher model guides the training of a smaller student model. The student model selectively shares attention matrices in layers with high similarity while inheriting key parameters from the teacher. Our best results with TinyLLaMA-1.1B demonstrate that EchoAtt improves inference speed by 15\%, training speed by 25\%, and reduces the number of parameters by approximately 4\%, all while improving zero-shot performance. These findings highlight the potential of attention matrix sharing to enhance the efficiency of LLMs, making them more practical for real-time and resource-limited applications.</description>

      <title>Patch Ranking: Efficient CLIP by Learning to Rank Local Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive image-text pre-trained models such as CLIP have shown remarkable adaptability to downstream tasks. However, they face challenges due to the high computational requirements of the Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone. Current strategies to boost ViT efficiency focus on pruning patch tokens but fall short in addressing the multimodal nature of CLIP and identifying the optimal subset of tokens for maximum performance. To address this, we propose greedy search methods to establish a "Golden Ranking" and introduce a lightweight predictor specifically trained to approximate this Ranking. To compensate for any performance degradation resulting from token pruning, we incorporate learnable visual tokens that aid in restoring and potentially enhancing the model's performance. Our work presents a comprehensive and systematic investigation of pruning tokens within the ViT backbone of CLIP models. Through our framework, we successfully reduced 40% of patch tokens in CLIP's ViT while only suffering a minimal average accuracy loss of 0.3 across seven datasets. Our study lays the groundwork for building more computationally efficient multimodal models without sacrificing their performance, addressing a key challenge in the application of advanced vision-language models.</description>

      <title>LatentQGAN: A Hybrid QGAN with Classical Convolutional Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning consists in taking advantage of quantum computations to generate classical data. A potential application of quantum machine learning is to harness the power of quantum computers for generating classical data, a process essential to a multitude of applications such as enriching training datasets, anomaly detection, and risk management in finance. Given the success of Generative Adversarial Networks in classical image generation, the development of its quantum versions has been actively conducted. However, existing implementations on quantum computers often face significant challenges, such as scalability and training convergence issues. To address these issues, we propose LatentQGAN, a novel quantum model that uses a hybrid quantum-classical GAN coupled with an autoencoder. Although it was initially designed for image generation, the LatentQGAN approach holds potential for broader application across various practical data generation tasks. Experimental outcomes on both classical simulators and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers have demonstrated significant performance enhancements over existing quantum methods, alongside a significant reduction in quantum resources overhead.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical end-to-end autonomous navigation through few-shot waypoint detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human navigation is facilitated through the association of actions with landmarks, tapping into our ability to recognize salient features in our environment. Consequently, navigational instructions for humans can be extremely concise, such as short verbal descriptions, indicating a small memory requirement and no reliance on complex and overly accurate navigation tools. Conversely, current autonomous navigation schemes rely on accurate positioning devices and algorithms as well as extensive streams of sensory data collected from the environment. Inspired by this human capability and motivated by the associated technological gap, in this work we propose a hierarchical end-to-end meta-learning scheme that enables a mobile robot to navigate in a previously unknown environment upon presentation of only a few sample images of a set of landmarks along with their corresponding high-level navigation actions. This dramatically simplifies the wayfinding process and enables easy adoption to new environments. For few-shot waypoint detection, we implement a metric-based few-shot learning technique through distribution embedding. Waypoint detection triggers the multi-task low-level maneuver controller module to execute the corresponding high-level navigation action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme using a small-scale autonomous vehicle on novel indoor navigation tasks in several previously unseen environments.</description>

      <title>Harmonising the Clinical Melody: Tuning Large Language Models for Hospital Course Summarisation in Clinical Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing volume and complexity of clinical documentation in Electronic Medical Records systems pose significant challenges for clinical coders, who must mentally process and summarise vast amounts of clinical text to extract essential information needed for coding tasks. While large language models have been successfully applied to shorter summarisation tasks in recent years, the challenge of summarising a hospital course remains an open area for further research and development. In this study, we adapted three pre trained LLMs, Llama 3, BioMistral, Mistral Instruct v0.1 for the hospital course summarisation task, using Quantized Low Rank Adaptation fine tuning. We created a free text clinical dataset from MIMIC III data by concatenating various clinical notes as the input clinical text, paired with ground truth Brief Hospital Course sections extracted from the discharge summaries for model training. The fine tuned models were evaluated using BERTScore and ROUGE metrics to assess the effectiveness of clinical domain fine tuning. Additionally, we validated their practical utility using a novel hospital course summary assessment metric specifically tailored for clinical coding. Our findings indicate that fine tuning pre trained LLMs for the clinical domain can significantly enhance their performance in hospital course summarisation and suggest their potential as assistive tools for clinical coding. Future work should focus on refining data curation methods to create higher quality clinical datasets tailored for hospital course summary tasks and adapting more advanced open source LLMs comparable to proprietary models to further advance this research.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Trajectory Recovery From Ash: An Open-Source Evaluation and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Once analysed, location trajectories can provide valuable insights beneficial to various applications. However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering them susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example, revealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations. Hence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One commonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work by Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and aggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details, obfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was evaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and subsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery attack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the preprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage still exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also indicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We release all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible and, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing a series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield higher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future research in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online execution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously considered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage. The findings emphasise the importance of using strong privacy-preserving mechanisms when releasing aggregated mobility data and not solely relying on aggregation as a means of anonymisation.</description>

      <title>Federated Graph Learning with Adaptive Importance-based Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For privacy-preserving graph learning tasks involving distributed graph datasets, federated learning (FL)-based GCN (FedGCN) training is required. A key challenge for FedGCN is scaling to large-scale graphs, which typically incurs high computation and communication costs when dealing with the explosively increasing number of neighbors. Existing graph sampling-enhanced FedGCN training approaches ignore graph structural information or dynamics of optimization, resulting in high variance and inaccurate node embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose the Federated Adaptive Importance-based Sampling (FedAIS) approach. It achieves substantial computational cost saving by focusing the limited resources on training important nodes, while reducing communication overhead via adaptive historical embedding synchronization. The proposed adaptive importance-based sampling method jointly considers the graph structural heterogeneity and the optimization dynamics to achieve optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Extensive evaluations against five state-of-the-art baselines on five real-world graph datasets show that FedAIS achieves comparable or up to 3.23% higher test accuracy, while saving communication and computation costs by 91.77% and 85.59%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows for most real-world applications remains an outstanding computational challenge. Several machine learning approaches have recently been proposed to alleviate the computational cost even though they become unstable or unphysical for long time predictions. We identify that the Fourier neural operator (FNO) based models combined with a partial differential equation (PDE) solver can accelerate fluid dynamic simulations and thus address computational expense of large-scale turbulence simulations. We treat the FNO model on the same footing as a PDE solver and answer important questions about the volume and temporal resolution of data required to build pre-trained models for turbulence. We also discuss the pitfalls of purely data-driven approaches that need to be avoided by the machine learning models to become viable and competitive tools for long time simulations of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Robust Training Objectives Improve Embedding-based Retrieval in Industrial Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving recommendation systems (RS) can greatly enhance the user experience across many domains, such as social media. Many RS utilize embedding-based retrieval (EBR) approaches to retrieve candidates for recommendation. In an EBR system, the embedding quality is key. According to recent literature, self-supervised multitask learning (SSMTL) has showed strong performance on academic benchmarks in embedding learning and resulted in an overall improvement in multiple downstream tasks, demonstrating a larger resilience to the adverse conditions between each downstream task and thereby increased robustness and task generalization ability through the training objective. However, whether or not the success of SSMTL in academia as a robust training objectives translates to large-scale (i.e., over hundreds of million users and interactions in-between) industrial RS still requires verification. Simply adopting academic setups in industrial RS might entail two issues. Firstly, many self-supervised objectives require data augmentations (e.g., embedding masking/corruption) over a large portion of users and items, which is prohibitively expensive in industrial RS. Furthermore, some self-supervised objectives might not align with the recommendation task, which might lead to redundant computational overheads or negative transfer. In light of these two challenges, we evaluate using a robust training objective, specifically SSMTL, through a large-scale friend recommendation system on a social media platform in the tech sector, identifying whether this increase in robustness can work at scale in enhancing retrieval in the production setting. Through online A/B testing with SSMTL-based EBR, we observe statistically significant increases in key metrics in the friend recommendations, with up to 5.45% improvements in new friends made and 1.91% improvements in new friends made with cold-start users.</description>

      <title>EDGE-Rec: Efficient and Data-Guided Edge Diffusion For Recommender Systems Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most recommender systems research focuses on binary historical user-item interaction encodings to predict future interactions. User features, item features, and interaction strengths remain largely under-utilized in this space or only indirectly utilized, despite proving largely effective in large-scale production recommendation systems. We propose a new attention mechanism, loosely based on the principles of collaborative filtering, called Row-Column Separable Attention RCSA to take advantage of real-valued interaction weights as well as user and item features directly. Building on this mechanism, we additionally propose a novel Graph Diffusion Transformer GDiT architecture which is trained to iteratively denoise the weighted interaction matrix of the user-item interaction graph directly. The weighted interaction matrix is built from the bipartite structure of the user-item interaction graph and corresponding edge weights derived from user-item rating interactions. Inspired by the recent progress in text-conditioned image generation, our method directly produces user-item rating predictions on the same scale as the original ratings by conditioning the denoising process on user and item features with a principled approach.</description>

      <title>Neural refractive index field: Unlocking the Potential of Background-oriented Schlieren Tomography in Volumetric Flow Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background-oriented Schlieren tomography (BOST) is a prevalent method for visualizing intricate turbulent flows, valued for its ease of implementation and capacity to capture three-dimensional distributions of a multitude of flow parameters. However, the voxel-based meshing scheme leads to significant challenges, such as inadequate spatial resolution, substantial discretization errors, poor noise immunity, and excessive computational costs. This work presents an innovative reconstruction approach termed neural refractive index field (NeRIF) which implicitly represents the flow field with a neural network, which is trained with tailored strategies. Both numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations on turbulent Bunsen flames suggest that our approach can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy and spatial resolution while concurrently reducing computational expenses. Although showcased in the context of background-oriented schlieren tomography here, the key idea embedded in the NeRIF can be readily adapted to various other tomographic modalities including tomographic absorption spectroscopy and tomographic particle imaging velocimetry, broadening its potential impact across different domains of flow visualization and analysis.</description>

      <title>EDSNet: Efficient-DSNet for Video Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current video summarization methods largely rely on transformer-based architectures, which, due to their quadratic complexity, require substantial computational resources. In this work, we address these inefficiencies by enhancing the Direct-to-Summarize Network (DSNet) with more resource-efficient token mixing mechanisms. We show that replacing traditional attention with alternatives like Fourier, Wavelet transforms, and Nystr\"omformer improves efficiency and performance. Furthermore, we explore various pooling strategies within the Regional Proposal Network, including ROI pooling, Fast Fourier Transform pooling, and flat pooling. Our experimental results on TVSum and SumMe datasets demonstrate that these modifications significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining competitive summarization performance. Thus, our work offers a more scalable solution for video summarization tasks.</description>

      <title>Multiscale scattered data analysis in samplet coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multiscale scattered data interpolation schemes for globally supported radial basis functions, with a focus on the Mat\'ern class. The multiscale approximation is constructed through a sequence of residual corrections, where radial basis functions with different lengthscale parameters are employed to capture varying levels of detail. To apply this approach to large data sets, we suggest to represent the resulting generalized Vandermonde matrices in samplet coordinates. Samplets are localized, discrete signed measures exhibiting vanishing moments and allow for the sparse approximation of generalized Vandermonde matrices issuing from a vast class of radial basis functions. Given a quasi-uniform set of $N$ data sites, and local approximation spaces with geometrically decreasing dimension, the full multiscale system can be assembled with cost $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$. We prove that the condition numbers of the linear systems at each level remain bounded independent of the particular level, allowing us to use an iterative solver with a bounded number of iterations for the numerical solution. Hence, the overall cost of the proposed approach is $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$. The theoretical findings are accompanied by extensive numerical studies in two and three spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Conformal Inference for Multi-Step Ahead Time-Series Forecasting Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to propose an adaptation of the well known adaptive conformal inference (ACI) algorithm to achieve finite-sample coverage guarantees in multi-step ahead time-series forecasting in the online setting. ACI dynamically adjusts significance levels, and comes with finite-sample guarantees on coverage, even for non-exchangeable data. Our multi-step ahead ACI procedure inherits these guarantees at each prediction step, as well as for the overall error rate. The multi-step ahead ACI algorithm can be used with different target error and learning rates at different prediction steps, which is illustrated in our numerical examples, where we employ a version of the confromalised ridge regression algorithm, adapted to multi-input multi-output forecasting. The examples serve to show how the method works in practice, illustrating the effect of variable target error and learning rates for different prediction steps, which suggests that a balance may be struck between efficiency (interval width) and coverage.t</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Language Model and Knowledge Distillation for Lightweight Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation models user interests based on historical behaviors to provide personalized recommendation. Previous sequential recommendation algorithms primarily employ neural networks to extract features of user interests, achieving good performance. However, due to the recommendation system datasets sparsity, these algorithms often employ small-scale network frameworks, resulting in weaker generalization capability. Recently, a series of sequential recommendation algorithms based on large pre-trained language models have been proposed. Nonetheless, given the real-time demands of recommendation systems, the challenge remains in applying pre-trained language models for rapid recommendations in real scenarios. To address this, we propose a sequential recommendation algorithm based on a pre-trained language model and knowledge distillation. The key of proposed algorithm is to transfer pre-trained knowledge across domains and achieve lightweight inference by knowledge distillation. The algorithm operates in two stages: in the first stage, we fine-tune the pre-trained language model on the recommendation dataset to transfer the pre-trained knowledge to the recommendation task; in the second stage, we distill the trained language model to transfer the learned knowledge to a lightweight model. Extensive experiments on multiple public recommendation datasets show that the proposed algorithm enhances recommendation accuracy and provide timely recommendation services.</description>

      <title>Identify As A Human Does: A Pathfinder of Next-Generation Anti-Cheat Framework for First-Person Shooter Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gaming industry has experienced substantial growth, but cheating in online games poses a significant threat to the integrity of the gaming experience. Cheating, particularly in first-person shooter (FPS) games, can lead to substantial losses for the game industry. Existing anti-cheat solutions have limitations, such as client-side hardware constraints, security risks, server-side unreliable methods, and both-sides suffer from a lack of comprehensive real-world datasets. To address these limitations, the paper proposes HAWK, a server-side FPS anti-cheat framework for the popular game CS:GO. HAWK utilizes machine learning techniques to mimic human experts' identification process, leverages novel multi-view features, and it is equipped with a well-defined workflow. The authors evaluate HAWK with the first large and real-world datasets containing multiple cheat types and cheating sophistication, and it exhibits promising efficiency and acceptable overheads, shorter ban times compared to the in-use anti-cheat, a significant reduction in manual labor, and the ability to capture cheaters who evaded official inspections.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Federated Learning in Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning in satellite constellations, where the satellites collaboratively train a machine learning model, is a promising technology towards enabling globally connected intelligence and the integration of space networks into terrestrial mobile networks. The energy required for this computationally intensive task is provided either by solar panels or by an internal battery if the satellite is in Earth's shadow. Careful management of this battery and system's available energy resources is not only necessary for reliable satellite operation, but also to avoid premature battery aging. We propose a novel energy-aware computation time scheduler for satellite FL, which aims to minimize battery usage without any impact on the convergence speed. Numerical results indicate an increase of more than 3x in battery lifetime can be achieved over energy-agnostic task scheduling.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Finetuning for Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DPO is an effective preference optimization algorithm. However, the DPO-tuned models tend to overfit on the dispreferred samples, manifested as overly long generations lacking diversity. While recent regularization approaches have endeavored to alleviate this issue by modifying the objective function, they achieved that at the cost of alignment performance degradation. In this paper, we innovatively incorporate regularization from the perspective of weight updating to curb alignment overfitting. Through the pilot experiment, we discovered that there exists a positive correlation between overfitting and the hyperspherical energy fluctuation. Hence, we introduce orthogonal finetuning for DPO via a weight-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) method, which merely conducts rotational and magnitude-stretching updates on the weight parameters to maintain the hyperspherical energy invariant, thereby preserving the knowledge encoded in the angle between neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model aligns perfectly with human preferences while retaining the original expressive capacity using only 0.0086% of the trainable parameters, suggesting an effective regularization against overfitting. Specifically, RoPO outperforms DPO by up to 10 points on MT-Bench and by up to 2.8 points on AlpacaEval 2, while enhancing the generation diversity by an average of 6 points.</description>

      <title>GroCo: Ground Constraint for Metric Self-Supervised Monocular Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has greatly improved in the recent years but models predicting metric depth still struggle to generalize across diverse camera poses and datasets. While recent supervised methods mitigate this issue by leveraging ground prior information at inference, their adaptability to self-supervised settings is limited due to the additional challenge of scale recovery. Addressing this gap, we propose in this paper a novel constraint on ground areas designed specifically for the self-supervised paradigm. This mechanism not only allows to accurately recover the scale but also ensures coherence between the depth prediction and the ground prior. Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing scale recovery techniques on the KITTI benchmark and significantly enhances model generalization capabilities. This improvement can be observed by its more robust performance across diverse camera rotations and its adaptability in zero-shot conditions with previously unseen driving datasets such as DDAD.</description>

      <title>Disentanglement with Factor Quantized Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to represent the underlying generative factors of a dataset in a latent representation independently of one another. In our work, we propose a discrete variational autoencoder (VAE) based model where the ground truth information about the generative factors are not provided to the model. We demonstrate the advantages of learning discrete representations over learning continuous representations in facilitating disentanglement. Furthermore, we propose incorporating an inductive bias into the model to further enhance disentanglement. Precisely, we propose scalar quantization of the latent variables in a latent representation with scalar values from a global codebook, and we add a total correlation term to the optimization as an inductive bias. Our method called FactorQVAE is the first method that combines optimization based disentanglement approaches with discrete representation learning, and it outperforms the former disentanglement methods in terms of two disentanglement metrics (DCI and InfoMEC) while improving the reconstruction performance. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/ituvisionlab/FactorQVAE}.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel embedding method diverging from conventional approaches by operating within function spaces of finite dimension rather than finite vector space, thus departing significantly from standard knowledge graph embedding techniques. Initially employing polynomial functions to compute embeddings, we progress to more intricate representations using neural networks with varying layer complexities. We argue that employing functions for embedding computation enhances expressiveness and allows for more degrees of freedom, enabling operations such as composition, derivatives and primitive of entities representation. Additionally, we meticulously outline the step-by-step construction of our approach and provide code for reproducibility, thereby facilitating further exploration and application in the field.</description>

      <title>Towards Ground-truth-free Evaluation of Any Segmentation in Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in building a ground-truth-free evaluation model to assess the quality of segmentations produced by SAM (Segment Anything Model) and its variants in medical images. This model estimates segmentation quality scores by comparing input images with their corresponding segmentation maps. Building on prior research, we frame this as a regression problem within a supervised learning framework, using Dice scores (and optionally other metrics) to compute the training loss. The model is trained using a large collection of public datasets of medical images with segmentation predictions from SAM and its variants. We name this model EvanySeg (Evaluation of Any Segmentation in Medical Images). Our exploration of convolution-based models (e.g., ResNet) and transformer-based models (e.g., ViT) revealed that ViT offers superior performance for EvanySeg. This model can be employed for various tasks, including: (1) identifying poorly segmented samples by detecting low-percentile segmentation quality scores; (2) benchmark segmentation models without ground truth by averaging scores across test samples; (3) alerting human experts during human-AI collaboration by applying a threshold within the score space; and (4) selecting the best segmentation prediction for each test sample at test time when multiple segmentation models are available, by choosing the prediction with the highest score. Models and code will be made available at https://github.com/ahjolsenbics/EvanySeg.</description>

      <title>Deploying Open-Source Large Language Models: A performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2023, large language models (LLMs) have seen considerable success, including in the open-source community, with many open-weight models available. However, the requirements to deploy such a service are often unknown and difficult to evaluate in advance. To facilitate this process, we conducted numerous tests at the Centre Inria de l'Universit\'e de Bordeaux. In this article, we propose a comparison of the performance of several models of different sizes (mainly Mistral and LLaMa) depending on the available GPUs, using vLLM, a Python library designed to optimize the inference of these models. Our results provide valuable information for private and public groups wishing to deploy LLMs, allowing them to evaluate the performance of different models based on their available hardware. This study thus contributes to facilitating the adoption and use of these large language models in various application domains.</description>

      <title>Built Different: Tactile Perception to Overcome Cross-Embodiment Capability Differences in Collaborative Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is a powerful means of implicit communication between a human and a robot assistant. In this paper, we investigate how tactile sensing can transcend cross-embodiment differences across robotic systems in the context of collaborative manipulation. Consider tasks such as collaborative object carrying where the human-robot interaction is force rich. Learning and executing such skills requires the robot to comply to the human and to learn behaviors at the joint-torque level. However, most robots do not offer this compliance or provide access to their joint torques. To address this challenge, we present an approach that uses tactile sensors to transfer policies from robots with these capabilities to those without. We show how our method can enable a cooperative task where a robot and human must work together to maneuver objects through space. We first demonstrate the skill on an impedance control-capable robot equipped with tactile sensing, then show the positive transfer of the tactile policy to a planar prismatic robot that is only capable of position control and does not come equipped with any sort of force/torque feedback, yet is able to comply to the human motions only using tactile feedback. Further details and videos can be found on our project website at https://www.mmintlab.com/research/tactile-collaborative/.</description>

      <title>CON: Continual Object Navigation via Data-Free Inter-Agent Knowledge Transfer in Unseen and Unfamiliar Places</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the potential of brief inter-agent knowledge transfer (KT) to enhance the robotic object goal navigation (ON) in unseen and unfamiliar environments. Drawing on the analogy of human travelers acquiring local knowledge, we propose a framework in which a traveler robot (student) communicates with local robots (teachers) to obtain ON knowledge through minimal interactions. We frame this process as a data-free continual learning (CL) challenge, aiming to transfer knowledge from a black-box model (teacher) to a new model (student). In contrast to approaches like zero-shot ON using large language models (LLMs), which utilize inherently communication-friendly natural language for knowledge representation, the other two major ON approaches -- frontier-driven methods using object feature maps and learning-based ON using neural state-action maps -- present complex challenges where data-free KT remains largely uncharted. To address this gap, we propose a lightweight, plug-and-play KT module targeting non-cooperative black-box teachers in open-world settings. Using the universal assumption that every teacher robot has vision and mobility capabilities, we define state-action history as the primary knowledge base. Our formulation leads to the development of a query-based occupancy map that dynamically represents target object locations, serving as an effective and communication-friendly knowledge representation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments conducted in the Habitat environment.</description>

      <title>Efficient Tabular Data Preprocessing of ML Pipelines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data preprocessing pipelines, which includes data decoding, cleaning, and transforming, are a crucial component of Machine Learning (ML) training. Thy are computationally intensive and often become a major bottleneck, due to the increasing performance gap between the CPUs used for preprocessing and the GPUs used for model training. Recent studies show that a significant number of CPUs across several machines are required to achieve sufficient throughput to saturate the GPUs, leading to increased resource and energy consumption. When the pipeline involves vocabulary generation, the preprocessing performance scales poorly due to significant row-wise synchronization overhead between different CPU cores and servers. To address this limitation, in this paper we present the design of Piper, a hardware accelerator for tabular data preprocessing, prototype it on FPGAs, and demonstrate its potential for training pipelines of commercial recommender systems. Piper achieves 4.7 $\sim$ 71.3$\times$ speedup in latency over a 128-core CPU server and outperforms a data-center GPU by 4.8$\sim$ 20.3$\times$ when using binary input. The impressive performance showcases Piper's potential to increase the efficiency of data preprocessing pipelines and significantly reduce their resource consumption.</description>

      <title>Towards a Realistic Long-Term Benchmark for Open-Web Research Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present initial results of a forthcoming benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on white-collar tasks of economic value. We evaluate eight realistic and ``messy'' tasks that are routine in finance and consulting, drawn from real-world cases from our customers. We lay the groundwork for an LLM agent evaluation suite where good performance directly corresponds to a large economic and societal impact. This fills a gap in existing benchmarks with tasks like ``order a pizza to the following address'' that do not constitute real-human work of economic value. Our evaluations assign credit to agents for partially solving tasks. By doing that, this initial evaluation, and the forthcoming benchmark, allow us to more accurately extrapolate performance of LLM-based agents on economically valuable tasks.
  We built and tested several architectures with GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 (405b), and GPT-4o-mini, ensuring that failure to solve a task was due to failures of reasoning and planning, rather than due to common failures like e.g. the inability to parse a website. On average, LLM agents powered by Claude-3.5 Sonnet substantially outperformed agents using GPT-4o, with agents based on Llama 3.1 (405b) and GPT-4o-mini lagging noticeably behind. Across LLMs, a ReAct architecture with the ability to delegate subtasks to subagents performed best. In addition to quantitative evaluations, we qualitatively assessed the performance of the LLM agents by inspecting their traces and reflecting on their observations.</description>

      <title>A Realistic Simulation Framework for Analog/Digital Neuromorphic Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing dedicated neuromorphic computing platforms optimized for embedded or edge-computing applications requires time-consuming design, fabrication, and deployment of full-custom neuromorphic processors.bTo ensure that initial prototyping efforts, exploring the properties of different network architectures and parameter settings, lead to realistic results it is important to use simulation frameworks that match as best as possible the properties of the final hardware. This is particularly challenging for neuromorphic hardware platforms made using mixed-signal analog/digital circuits, due to the variability and noise sensitivity of their components. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a software spiking neural network simulator explicitly designed to account for the properties of mixed-signal neuromorphic circuits, including device mismatch variability. The simulator, called ARCANA (A Realistic Simulation Framework for Analog/Digital Neuromorphic Architectures), is designed to reproduce the dynamics of mixed-signal synapse and neuron electronic circuits with autogradient differentiation for parameter optimization and GPU acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by matching software simulation results with measurements made from an existing neuromorphic processor. We show how the results obtained provide a reliable estimate of the behavior of the spiking neural network trained in software, once deployed in hardware. This framework enables the development and innovation of new learning rules and processing architectures in neuromorphic embedded systems.</description>

      <title>Blind Spatial Impulse Response Generation from Separate Room- and Scene-Specific Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For audio in augmented reality (AR), knowledge of the users' real acoustic environment is crucial for rendering virtual sounds that seamlessly blend into the environment. As acoustic measurements are usually not feasible in practical AR applications, information about the room needs to be inferred from available sound sources. Then, additional sound sources can be rendered with the same room acoustic qualities. Crucially, these are placed at different positions than the sources available for estimation. Here, we propose to use an encoder network trained using a contrastive loss that maps input sounds to a low-dimensional feature space representing only room-specific information. Then, a diffusion-based spatial room impulse response generator is trained to take the latent space and generate a new response, given a new source-receiver position. We show how both room- and position-specific parameters are considered in the final output.</description>

      <title>(De)-regularized Maximum Mean Discrepancy Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a (de)-regularization of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (DrMMD) and its Wasserstein gradient flow. Existing gradient flows that transport samples from source distribution to target distribution with only target samples, either lack tractable numerical implementation ($f$-divergence flows) or require strong assumptions, and modifications such as noise injection, to ensure convergence (Maximum Mean Discrepancy flows). In contrast, DrMMD flow can simultaneously (i) guarantee near-global convergence for a broad class of targets in both continuous and discrete time, and (ii) be implemented in closed form using only samples. The former is achieved by leveraging the connection between the DrMMD and the $\chi^2$-divergence, while the latter comes by treating DrMMD as MMD with a de-regularized kernel. Our numerical scheme uses an adaptive de-regularization schedule throughout the flow to optimally trade off between discretization errors and deviations from the $\chi^2$ regime. The potential application of the DrMMD flow is demonstrated across several numerical experiments, including a large-scale setting of training student/teacher networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Integration of Task-Specific Adapters for Class Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-exemplar class Incremental Learning (NECIL) enables models to continuously acquire new classes without retraining from scratch and storing old task exemplars, addressing privacy and storage issues. However, the absence of data from earlier tasks exacerbates the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in NECIL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Integration of task-specific Adapters (DIA), which comprises two key components: Task-Specific Adapter Integration (TSAI) and Patch-Level Model Alignment. TSAI boosts compositionality through a patch-level adapter integration strategy, which provides a more flexible compositional solution while maintaining low computation costs. Patch-Level Model Alignment maintains feature consistency and accurate decision boundaries via two specialized mechanisms: Patch-Level Distillation Loss (PDL) and Patch-Level Feature Reconstruction method (PFR). Specifically, the PDL preserves feature-level consistency between successive models by implementing a distillation loss based on the contributions of patch tokens to new class learning. The PFR facilitates accurate classifier alignment by reconstructing old class features from previous tasks that adapt to new task knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our DIA, revealing significant improvements on benchmark datasets in the NECIL setting, maintaining an optimal balance between computational complexity and accuracy. The full code implementation will be made publicly available upon the publication of this paper.</description>

      <title>Methods for Convex $(L_0,L_1)$-Smooth Optimization: Clipping, Acceleration, and Adaptivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the non-smoothness of optimization problems in Machine Learning, generalized smoothness assumptions have been gaining a lot of attention in recent years. One of the most popular assumptions of this type is $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness (Zhang et al., 2020). In this paper, we focus on the class of (strongly) convex $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth functions and derive new convergence guarantees for several existing methods. In particular, we derive improved convergence rates for Gradient Descent with (Smoothed) Gradient Clipping and for Gradient Descent with Polyak Stepsizes. In contrast to the existing results, our rates do not rely on the standard smoothness assumption and do not suffer from the exponential dependency from the initial distance to the solution. We also extend these results to the stochastic case under the over-parameterization assumption, propose a new accelerated method for convex $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth optimization, and derive new convergence rates for Adaptive Gradient Descent (Malitsky and Mishchenko, 2020).</description>

Abstract: We propose an extension of the reinforcement learning architecture that enables moral decision-making of reinforcement learning agents based on normative reasons. Central to this approach is a reason-based shield generator yielding a moral shield that binds the agent to actions that conform with recognized normative reasons so that our overall architecture restricts the agent to actions that are (internally) morally justified. In addition, we describe an algorithm that allows to iteratively improve the reason-based shield generator through case-based feedback from a moral judge.</description>

Abstract: Data compression continues to evolve, with traditional information theory methods being widely used for compressing text, images, and videos. Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging Generative AI for predictive compression techniques. This paper introduces a lossless text compression approach using a Large Language Model (LLM). The method involves two key steps: first, prediction using a dense neural network architecture, such as a transformer block; second, compressing the predicted ranks with standard compression algorithms like Adaptive Huffman, LZ77, or Gzip. Extensive analysis and benchmarking against conventional information-theoretic baselines demonstrate that neural compression offers improved performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance threat intelligence by automating the collection, preprocessing, and analysis of threat data. However, the usability of these tools is critical to ensure their effective adoption by security professionals. Despite the advanced capabilities of LLMs, concerns about their reliability, accuracy, and potential for generating inaccurate information persist. This study conducts a comprehensive usability evaluation of five LLMs ChatGPT, Gemini, Cohere, Copilot, and Meta AI focusing on their user interface design, error handling, learning curve, performance, and integration with existing tools in threat intelligence enrichment. Utilizing a heuristic walkthrough and a user study methodology, we identify key usability issues and offer actionable recommendations for improvement. Our findings aim to bridge the gap between LLM functionality and user experience, thereby promoting more efficient and accurate threat intelligence practices by ensuring these tools are user-friendly and reliable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely disease diagnosis is challenging due to increasing disease burdens and limited clinician availability. AI shows promise in diagnosis accuracy but faces real-world application issues due to insufficient validation in clinical workflows and diverse populations. This study addresses gaps in medical AI downstream accountability through a case study on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) diagnosis and severity classification. We designed and implemented an AI-assisted diagnostic workflow for AMD, comparing diagnostic performance with and without AI assistance among 24 clinicians from 12 institutions with real patient data sampled from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS). Additionally, we demonstrated continual enhancement of an existing AI model by incorporating approximately 40,000 additional medical images (named AREDS2 dataset). The improved model was then systematically evaluated using both AREDS and AREDS2 test sets, as well as an external test set from Singapore. AI assistance markedly enhanced diagnostic accuracy and classification for 23 out of 24 clinicians, with the average F1-score increasing by 20% from 37.71 (Manual) to 45.52 (Manual + AI) (P-value &lt; 0.0001), achieving an improvement of over 50% in some cases. In terms of efficiency, AI assistance reduced diagnostic times for 17 out of the 19 clinicians tracked, with time savings of up to 40%. Furthermore, a model equipped with continual learning showed robust performance across three independent datasets, recording a 29% increase in accuracy, and elevating the F1-score from 42 to 54 in the Singapore population.</description>

In this paper, through trace-based experiments, we found that the existing method for long sequences results in a high Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) due to sequential chunk processing, long Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) from batching long-sequence prefills and decodes, and low throughput due to constrained key-value cache (KVC) for long sequences. To address these issues, we propose two Sequence-Parallelism (SP) architectures for both tensor parallelism (TP) and non-TP. However, SP introduces two challenges: 1) network communication and computation become performance bottlenecks; 2) the latter two issues above are mitigated but not resolved, and SP's resultant KV value distribution across GPUs still requires communication for decode, increasing TBT. Hence, we propose a Communication-efficient Sparse Attention (CSA) and communication-computation-communication three-phase pipelining. We also propose SP-based decode that processes decode separately from prefill, distributes KV values of a request across different GPUs, and novelly moves Query (Q) values instead of KV values to reduce communication overhead. These methods constitute a communication-efficient Sequence-Parallelism based LLM Serving System (SPS2). Our trace-driven evaluation demonstrates that SPS2 improves the average TTFT, TBT, and response time by up to 7.5x, 1.92x, and 9.8x and improves the prefill and decode throughput by 8.2x and 5.2x while maintaining the accuracy compared to Sarathi-Serve. We distributed our source code.</description>

      <title>The BRAVO Semantic Segmentation Challenge Results in UNCV2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the unified BRAVO challenge to benchmark the reliability of semantic segmentation models under realistic perturbations and unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We define two categories of reliability: (1) semantic reliability, which reflects the model's accuracy and calibration when exposed to various perturbations; and (2) OOD reliability, which measures the model's ability to detect object classes that are unknown during training. The challenge attracted nearly 100 submissions from international teams representing notable research institutions. The results reveal interesting insights into the importance of large-scale pre-training and minimal architectural design in developing robust and reliable semantic segmentation models.</description>

      <title>UTrace: Poisoning Forensics for Private Collaborative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) enables multiple data owners to contribute their data privately to a set of servers that run a secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocol to train a joint ML model. In these protocols, the input data remains private throughout the training process, and only the resulting model is made available. While this approach benefits privacy, it also exacerbates the risks of data poisoning, where compromised data owners induce undesirable model behavior by contributing malicious datasets. Existing MPC mechanisms can mitigate certain poisoning attacks, but these measures are not exhaustive. To complement existing poisoning defenses, we introduce UTrace: a framework for User-level Traceback of poisoning attacks in PPML. Utrace computes user responsibility scores using gradient similarity metrics aggregated across the most relevant samples in an owner's dataset. UTrace is effective at low poisoning rates and is resilient to poisoning attacks distributed across multiple data owners, unlike existing unlearning-based methods. We introduce methods for checkpointing gradients with low storage overhead, enabling traceback in the absence of data owners at deployment time. We also design several optimizations that reduce traceback time and communication in MPC. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of UTrace across four datasets from three data modalities (vision, text, and malware) and show its effectiveness against 10 poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>CAMAL: Optimizing LSM-trees via Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use machine learning to optimize LSM-tree structure, aiming to reduce the cost of processing various read/write operations. We introduce a new approach Camal, which boasts the following features: (1) ML-Aided: Camal is the first attempt to apply active learning to tune LSM-tree based key-value stores. The learning process is coupled with traditional cost models to improve the training process; (2) Decoupled Active Learning: backed by rigorous analysis, Camal adopts active learning paradigm based on a decoupled tuning of each parameter, which further accelerates the learning process; (3) Easy Extrapolation: Camal adopts an effective mechanism to incrementally update the model with the growth of the data size; (4) Dynamic Mode: Camal is able to tune LSM-tree online under dynamically changing workloads; (5) Significant System Improvement: By integrating Camal into a full system RocksDB, the system performance improves by 28% on average and up to 8x compared to a state-of-the-art RocksDB design.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Path Integral Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a novel approach for sampling from a continuous multivariate probability distribution, which may either be explicitly known (up to a normalization factor) or represented via empirical samples. Our method constructs a time-dependent bridge from a delta function centered at the origin of the state space at $t=0$, optimally transforming it into the target distribution at $t=1$. We formulate this as a Stochastic Optimal Control problem of the Path Integral Control type, with a cost function comprising (in its basic form) a quadratic control term, a quadratic state term, and a terminal constraint. This framework, which we refer to as Harmonic Path Integral Diffusion (H-PID), leverages an analytical solution through a mapping to an auxiliary quantum harmonic oscillator in imaginary time.
  The H-PID framework results in a set of efficient sampling algorithms, without the incorporation of Neural Networks. The algorithms are validated on two standard use cases: a mixture of Gaussians over a grid and images from CIFAR-10. We contrast these algorithms with other sampling methods, particularly simulated annealing and path integral sampling, highlighting their advantages in terms of analytical control, accuracy, and computational efficiency on benchmark problems.
  Additionally, we extend the methodology to more general cases where the underlying stochastic differential equation includes an external deterministic, possibly non-conservative force, and where the cost function incorporates a gauge potential term. These extensions open up new possibilities for applying our framework to a broader range of statistics specific to applications.</description>

      <title>Skills Made to Order: Efficient Acquisition of Robot Cooking Skills Guided by Multiple Forms of Internet Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the utility of various internet data sources to select among a set of template robot behaviors to perform skills. Learning contact-rich skills involving tool use from internet data sources has typically been challenging due to the lack of physical information such as contact existence, location, areas, and force in this data. Prior works have generally used internet data and foundation models trained on this data to generate low-level robot behavior. We hypothesize that these data and models may be better suited to selecting among a set of basic robot behaviors to perform these contact-rich skills. We explore three methods of template selection: querying large language models, comparing video of robot execution to retrieved human video using features from a pretrained video encoder common in prior work, and performing the same comparison using features from an optic flow encoder trained on internet data. Our results show that LLMs are surprisingly capable template selectors despite their lack of visual information, optical flow encoding significantly outperforms video encoders trained with an order of magnitude more data, and important synergies exist between various forms of internet data for template selection. By exploiting these synergies, we create a template selector using multiple forms of internet data that achieves a 79\% success rate on a set of 16 different cooking skills involving tool-use.</description>

      <title>Interpretability-Guided Test-Time Adversarial Defense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and low-cost test-time adversarial defense by devising interpretability-guided neuron importance ranking methods to identify neurons important to the output classes. Our method is a training-free approach that can significantly improve the robustness-accuracy tradeoff while incurring minimal computational overhead. While being among the most efficient test-time defenses (4x faster), our method is also robust to a wide range of black-box, white-box, and adaptive attacks that break previous test-time defenses. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method for CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-1k on the standard RobustBench benchmark (with average gains of 2.6%, 4.9%, and 2.8% respectively). We also show improvements (average 1.5%) over the state-of-the-art test-time defenses even under strong adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>ASTE Transformer Modelling Dependencies in Aspect-Sentiment Triplet Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aspect-Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a recently proposed task of aspect-based sentiment analysis that consists in extracting (aspect phrase, opinion phrase, sentiment polarity) triples from a given sentence. Recent state-of-the-art methods approach this task by first extracting all possible text spans from a given text, then filtering the potential aspect and opinion phrases with a classifier, and finally considering all their pairs with another classifier that additionally assigns sentiment polarity to them. Although several variations of the above scheme have been proposed, the common feature is that the final result is constructed by a sequence of independent classifier decisions. This hinders the exploitation of dependencies between extracted phrases and prevents the use of knowledge about the interrelationships between classifier predictions to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a new ASTE approach consisting of three transformer-inspired layers, which enables the modelling of dependencies both between phrases and between the final classifier decisions. Experimental results show that the method achieves higher performance in terms of F1 measure than other methods studied on popular benchmarks. In addition, we show that a simple pre-training technique further improves the performance of the model.</description>

      <title>RAMBO: Enhancing RAG-based Repository-Level Method Body Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code completion is essential in software development, helping developers by predicting code snippets based on context. Among completion tasks, Method Body Completion (MBC) is particularly challenging as it involves generating complete method bodies based on their signatures and context. This task becomes significantly harder in large repositories, where method bodies must integrate repositoryspecific elements such as custom APIs, inter-module dependencies, and project-specific conventions. In this paper, we introduce RAMBO, a novel RAG-based approach for repository-level MBC. Instead of retrieving similar method bodies, RAMBO identifies essential repositoryspecific elements, such as classes, methods, and variables/fields, and their relevant usages. By incorporating these elements and their relevant usages into the code generation process, RAMBO ensures more accurate and contextually relevant method bodies. Our experimental results with leading code LLMs across 40 Java projects show that RAMBO significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art repository-level MBC approaches, with the improvements of up to 46% in BLEU, 57% in CodeBLEU, 36% in Compilation Rate, and up to 3X in Exact Match. Notably, RAMBO surpassed RepoCoder Oracle method by up to 12% in Exact Match, setting a new benchmark for repository-level MBC.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Triangle Counting in Graph Streams Using Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first efficient and practical algorithm for estimating the number of triangles in a graph stream using predictions. Our algorithm combines waiting room sampling and reservoir sampling with a predictor for the heaviness of edges, that is, the number of triangles in which an edge is involved. As a result, our algorithm is fast, provides guarantees on the amount of memory used, and exploits the additional information provided by the predictor to produce highly accurate estimates. We also propose a simple and domain-independent predictor, based on the degree of nodes, that can be easily computed with one pass on a stream of edges when the stream is available beforehand.
  Our analytical results show that, when the predictor provides useful information on the heaviness of edges, it leads to estimates with reduced variance compared to the state-of-the-art, even when the predictions are far from perfect. Our experimental results show that, when analyzing a single graph stream, our algorithm is faster than the state-of-the-art for a given memory budget, while providing significantly more accurate estimates. Even more interestingly, when sequences of hundreds of graph streams are analyzed, our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art using our simple degree-based predictor built by analyzing only the first graph of the sequence.</description>

      <title>HydroVision: LiDAR-Guided Hydrometric Prediction with Vision Transformers and Hybrid Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrometric forecasting is crucial for managing water resources, flood prediction, and environmental protection. Water stations are interconnected, and this connectivity influences the measurements at other stations. However, the dynamic and implicit nature of water flow paths makes it challenging to extract a priori knowledge of the connectivity structure. We hypothesize that terrain elevation significantly affects flow and connectivity. To incorporate this, we use LiDAR terrain elevation data encoded through a Vision Transformer (ViT). The ViT, which has demonstrated excellent performance in image classification by directly applying transformers to sequences of image patches, efficiently captures spatial features of terrain elevation. To account for both spatial and temporal features, we employ GRU blocks enhanced with graph convolution, a method widely used in the literature. We propose a hybrid graph learning structure that combines static and dynamic graph learning. A static graph, derived from transformer-encoded LiDAR data, captures terrain elevation relationships, while a dynamic graph adapts to temporal changes, improving the overall graph representation. We apply graph convolution in two layers through these static and dynamic graphs. Our method makes daily predictions up to 12 days ahead. Empirical results from multiple water stations in Quebec demonstrate that our method significantly reduces prediction error by an average of 10\% across all days, with greater improvements for longer forecasting horizons.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Crowd Trip Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for various applications in active traffic management, urban planning, traffic control, crowd management, and autonomous driving, aiming to enhance traffic safety and efficiency. Accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories requires a deep understanding of individual behaviors, social interactions, and road environments. Existing studies have developed various models to capture the influence of social interactions and road conditions on pedestrian trajectories. However, these approaches are limited by the lack of a comprehensive view of social interactions and road environments. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of pedestrian trajectory prediction, we propose a novel approach incorporating trip information as a new modality into pedestrian trajectory models. We propose RNTransformer, a generic model that utilizes crowd trip information to capture global information on social interactions. We incorporated RNTransformer with various socially aware local pedestrian trajectory prediction models to demonstrate its performance. Specifically, by leveraging a pre-trained RNTransformer when training different pedestrian trajectory prediction models, we observed improvements in performance metrics: a 1.3/2.2% enhancement in ADE/FDE on Social-LSTM, a 6.5/28.4% improvement on Social-STGCNN, and an 8.6/4.3% improvement on S-Implicit. Evaluation results demonstrate that RNTransformer significantly enhances the accuracy of various pedestrian trajectory prediction models across multiple datasets. Further investigation reveals that the RNTransformer effectively guides local models to more accurate directions due to the consideration of global information. By exploring crowd behavior within the road network, our approach shows great promise in improving pedestrian safety through accurate trajectory predictions.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Routing Algorithm over SDN: Reusable Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic routing is vital for the proper functioning of the Internet. As users and network traffic increase, researchers try to develop adaptive and intelligent routing algorithms that can fulfill various QoS requirements. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based routing algorithms have shown better performance than traditional approaches. We developed a QoS-aware, reusable RL routing algorithm, RLSR-Routing over SDN. During the learning process, our algorithm ensures loop-free path exploration. While finding the path for one traffic demand (a source destination pair with certain amount of traffic), RLSR-Routing learns the overall network QoS status, which can be used to speed up algorithm convergence when finding the path for other traffic demands. By adapting Segment Routing, our algorithm can achieve flow-based, source packet routing, and reduce communications required between SDN controller and network plane. Our algorithm shows better performance in terms of load balancing than the traditional approaches. It also has faster convergence than the non-reusable RL approach when finding paths for multiple traffic demands.</description>

      <title>AutoAPIEval: A Framework for Automated Evaluation of LLMs in API-Oriented Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have emerged as powerful tools for code generation, significantly enhancing productivity and accelerating software development. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general code generation without considering API-oriented code generation, i.e., generating code that invokes APIs from specific libraries. Given the growing demand for API-oriented code generation, there is a pressing need for a systematic and automated approach to evaluate LLM on API-oriented code generation. To address this gap, we propose AutoAPIEval, a lightweight and automated framework designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in API-oriented code generation. Our framework works with any library that provides API documentation and focuses on two unit tasks: API recommendation and code example generation, along with four metrics to evaluate the generated APIs and code examples, such as the proportion of incorrect API recommendations for Task 1, and the proportion of code examples where no specific API is invoked and uncompilable/unexecutable code examples for Task 2. In addition, we conducted a case study on three LLMs (ChatGPT, MagiCoder, and DeepSeek Coder) and Java Runtime Environment 8 to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Our findings reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across tasks, with ChatGPT adhering better to instructions, while sharing similar effectiveness in code example generation with its counterparts (i.e., MagiCoder and DeekSeek Coder). We also identify key factors associated with code quality, such as API popularity and model confidence, and build classifiers that achieve high accuracy in detecting incorrect API recommendations and erroneous code examples. Retrieval-augmented generation enhances the quality of code generated by LLMs, though its effectiveness varies across different LLMs.</description>

      <title>Domino: Eliminating Communication in LLM Training via Generic Tensor Slicing and Overlapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs for parallelizing and accelerating the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces training and provides generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that, comparing with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Toric Duality in Brane Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a variety of machine learning methods to the study of Seiberg duality within 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ quantum field theories arising on the worldvolumes of D3-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. Such theories admit an elegant description in terms of bipartite tessellations of the torus known as brane tilings or dimer models. An intricate network of infrared dualities interconnects the space of such theories and partitions it into universality classes, the prediction and classification of which is a problem that naturally lends itself to a machine learning investigation. In this paper, we address a preliminary set of such enquiries. We begin by training a fully connected neural network to identify classes of Seiberg dual theories realised on $\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ orbifolds of the conifold and achieve $R^2=0.988$. Then, we evaluate various notions of robustness of our methods against perturbations of the space of theories under investigation, and discuss these results in terms of the nature of the neural network's learning. Finally, we employ a more sophisticated residual architecture to classify the toric phase space of the $Y^{6,0}$ theories, and to predict the individual gauged linear $\sigma$-model multiplicities in toric diagrams thereof. In spite of the non-trivial nature of this task, we achieve remarkably accurate results; namely, upon fixing a choice of Kasteleyn matrix representative, the regressor achieves a mean absolute error of $0.021$. We also discuss how the performance is affected by relaxing these assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, we will discuss the use of Machine Learning methods for the identification and localization of cometary activity for Solar System objects in ground and in space-based wide-field all-sky surveys. We will begin the chapter by discussing the challenges of identifying known and unknown active, extended Solar System objects in the presence of stellar-type sources and the application of classical pre-ML identification techniques and their limitations. We will then transition to the discussion of implementing ML techniques to address the challenge of extended object identification. We will finish with prospective future methods and the application to future surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>The Palomar twilight survey of 'Ayl\'o'chaxnim, Atiras, and comets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-sun sky twilight observations allow for the detection of asteroid interior to the orbit of Venus (Aylos), the Earth (Atiras), and comets. We present the results of observations with the Palomar 48-inch telescope (P48)/Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera in 30 s r-band exposures taken during evening astronomical twilight from 2019 Sep 20 to 2022 March 7 and during morning astronomical twilight sky from 2019 Sep 21 to 2022 Sep 29. More than 46,000 exposures were taken in evening and morning astronomical twilight within 31 to 66 degrees from the Sun with an r-band limiting magnitude between 18.1 and 20.9. The twilight pointings show a slight seasonal dependence in limiting magnitude and ability to point closer towards the Sun, with limiting magnitude slightly improving during summer. In total, the one Aylo, (594913) 'Ayl\'o'chaxnim, and 4 Atiras, 2020 OV1, 2021 BS1, 2021 PB2, and 2021 VR3, were discovered in evening and morning twilight observations. Additional twilight survey discoveries also include 6 long-period comets: C/2020 T2, C/2020 V2, C/2021 D2, C/2021 E3, C/2022 E3, and C/2022 P3, and two short-period comets: P/2021 N1 and P/2022 P2 using deep learning comet detection pipelines. The P48/ZTF twilight survey also recovered 11 known Atiras, one Aylo, three short-period comes, two long-period comets, and one interstellar object. Lastly, the Vera Rubin Observatory will conduct a twilight survey starting in its first year of operations and will cover the sky within 45 degrees of the Sun. Twilight surveys such as those by ZTF and future surveys will provide opportunities for discovering asteroids inside the orbits of Earth and Venus.</description>

      <title>Unsupervisedly Learned Representations: Should the Quest be Over?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.07495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After four decades of research there still exists a Classification accuracy gap of about 20% between our best Unsupervisedly Learned Representations methods and the accuracy rates achieved by intelligent animals. It thus may well be that we are looking in the wrong direction. A possible solution to this puzzle is presented. We demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning can learn representations which achieve the same accuracy as that of animals. Our main modest contribution lies in the observations that: a. when applied to a real world environment Reinforcement Learning does not require labels, and thus may be legitimately considered as Unsupervised Learning, and b. in contrast, when Reinforcement Learning is applied in a simulated environment it does inherently require labels and should thus be generally be considered as Supervised Learning. The corollary of these observations is that further search for Unsupervised Learning competitive paradigms which may be trained in simulated environments may be futile.</description>

      <title>Does DQN Learn?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13617v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a reinforcement learning method to be useful, the policy it estimates in the limit must be superior to the initial guess, at least on average. In this work, we show that the widely used Deep Q-Network (DQN) fails to meet even this basic criterion, even when it gets to see all possible states and actions infinitely often (a condition that ensures tabular Q-learning's convergence to the optimal Q-value). Our work's key highlights are as follows. First, we numerically show that DQN generally has a non-trivial probability of producing a policy worse than the initial one. Second, we give a theoretical explanation for this behavior in the context of linear DQN, wherein we replace the neural network with a linear function approximation but retain DQN's other key ideas, such as experience replay, target network, and $\epsilon$-greedy exploration. Our main result is that the tail behaviors of linear DQN are governed by invariant sets of a deterministic differential inclusion, a set-valued generalization of a differential equation. Notably, we show that these invariant sets need not align with locally optimal policies, thus explaining DQN's pathological behaviors, such as convergence to sub-optimal policies and policy oscillation. We also provide a scenario where the limiting policy is always the worst. Our work addresses a longstanding gap in understanding the behaviors of Q-learning with function approximation and $\epsilon$-greedy exploration.</description>

      <title>How Does Return Distribution in Distributional Reinforcement Learning Help Optimization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning, which focuses on learning the entire return distribution instead of only its expectation in standard RL, has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing performance. Despite these advancements, our comprehension of how the return distribution within distributional RL still remains limited. In this study, we investigate the optimization advantages of distributional RL by utilizing its extra return distribution knowledge over classical RL within the Neural Fitted Z-Iteration~(Neural FZI) framework. To begin with, we demonstrate that the distribution loss of distributional RL has desirable smoothness characteristics and hence enjoys stable gradients, which is in line with its tendency to promote optimization stability. Furthermore, the acceleration effect of distributional RL is revealed by decomposing the return distribution. It shows that distributional RL can perform favorably if the return distribution approximation is appropriate, measured by the variance of gradient estimates in each environment. Rigorous experiments validate the stable optimization behaviors of distributional RL and its acceleration effects compared to classical RL. Our research findings illuminate how the return distribution in distributional RL algorithms helps the optimization.</description>

      <title>Learning New Tasks from a Few Examples with Soft-Label Prototypes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17437v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to few-shot learning in NLP rely on large language models (LLMs) and/or fine-tuning of these to generalise on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning approach based on soft-label prototypes (SLPs) designed to collectively capture the distribution of different classes across the input domain space. We focus on learning previously unseen NLP tasks from very few examples (4, 8, 16) per class and experimentally demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on the majority of tested tasks in this data-lean setting while being highly parameter efficient. We also show that our few-shot adaptation method can be integrated into more generalised learning settings, primarily meta-learning, to yield superior performance against strong baselines.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive and Stability-Promoting Layerwise Training Approach for Sparse Deep Neural Network Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a two-stage adaptive framework for progressively developing deep neural network (DNN) architectures that generalize well for a given training data set. In the first stage, a layerwise training approach is adopted where a new layer is added each time and trained independently by freezing parameters in the previous layers. We impose desirable structures on the DNN by employing manifold regularization, sparsity regularization, and physics-informed terms. We introduce a epsilon-delta stability-promoting concept as a desirable property for a learning algorithm and show that employing manifold regularization yields a epsilon-delta stability-promoting algorithm. Further, we also derive the necessary conditions for the trainability of a newly added layer and investigate the training saturation problem. In the second stage of the algorithm (post-processing), a sequence of shallow networks is employed to extract information from the residual produced in the first stage, thereby improving the prediction accuracy. Numerical investigations on prototype regression and classification problems demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform fully connected DNNs of the same size. Moreover, by equipping the physics-informed neural network (PINN) with the proposed adaptive architecture strategy to solve partial differential equations, we numerically show that adaptive PINNs not only are superior to standard PINNs but also produce interpretable hidden layers with provable stability. We also apply our architecture design strategy to solve inverse problems governed by elliptic partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have catalyzed the design and development of various intelligent systems over wide application domains. While most existing machine learning models require large memory and computing power, efforts have been made to deploy some models on resource-constrained devices as well. A majority of the early application systems focused on exploiting the inference capabilities of ML and DL models, where data captured from different mobile and embedded sensing components are processed through these models for application goals such as classification and segmentation. More recently, the concept of exploiting the mobile and embedded computing resources for ML/DL model training has gained attention, as such capabilities allow (i) the training of models via local data without the need to share data over wireless links, thus enabling privacy-preserving computation by design, (ii) model personalization and environment adaptation, and (ii) deployment of accurate models in remote and hardly accessible locations without stable internet connectivity. This work targets to summarize and analyze state-of-the-art systems research that allows such on-device model training capabilities and provide a survey of on-device training from a systems perspective.</description>

      <title>CURO: Curriculum Learning for Relative Overgeneralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relative overgeneralization (RO) is a pathology that can arise in cooperative multi-agent tasks when the optimal joint action's utility falls below that of a sub-optimal joint action. RO can cause the agents to get stuck into local optima or fail to solve cooperative tasks requiring significant coordination between agents within a given timestep. In this work, we empirically find that, in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), both value-based and policy gradient MARL algorithms can suffer from RO and fail to learn effective coordination policies. To better overcome RO, we propose a novel approach called curriculum learning for relative overgeneralization (CURO). To solve a target task that exhibits strong RO, in CURO, we first fine-tune the reward function of the target task to generate source tasks to train the agent. Then, to effectively transfer the knowledge acquired in one task to the next, we use a transfer learning method that combines value function transfer with buffer transfer, which enables more efficient exploration in the target task. CURO is general and can be applied to both value-based and policy gradient MARL methods. We demonstrate that, when applied to QMIX, HAPPO, and HATRPO, CURO can successfully overcome severe RO, achieve improved performance, and outperform baseline methods in a variety of challenging cooperative multi-agent tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Relation-aware Neighborhood Aggregation in Graph Neural Networks via Tensor Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05581v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been developed to tackle the challenge of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE). However, many of these approaches overlook the crucial role of relation information and inadequately integrate it with entity information, resulting in diminished expressive power. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph encoder that incorporates tensor decomposition within the aggregation function of Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN). Our model enhances the representation of neighboring entities by employing projection matrices of a low-rank tensor defined by relation types. This approach facilitates multi-task learning, thereby generating relation-aware representations. Furthermore, we introduce a low-rank estimation technique for the core tensor through CP decomposition, which effectively compresses and regularizes our model. We adopt a training strategy inspired by contrastive learning, which relieves the training limitation of the 1-N method inherent in handling vast graphs. We outperformed all our competitors on two common benchmark datasets, FB15k-237 and WN18RR, while using low-dimensional embeddings for entities and relations.</description>

      <title>High-Level Synthetic Data Generation with Data Set Archetypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cluster analysis relies on effective benchmarks for evaluating and comparing different algorithms. Simulation studies on synthetic data are popular because important features of the data sets, such as the overlap between clusters, or the variation in cluster shapes, can be effectively varied. Unfortunately, curating evaluation scenarios is often laborious, as practitioners must find lower-level geometric parameters (like cluster covariance matrices) to match a higher-level scenario description like "clusters with very different shapes." To make benchmarks more convenient and informative, we propose synthetic data generation based on data set archetypes. In this paradigm, the user describes an evaluation scenario in a high-level manner, and the software automatically generates data sets with the desired characteristics. Combining such data set archetypes with large language models (LLMs), it is possible to set up benchmarks purely from verbal descriptions of the evaluation scenarios. We provide an open-source Python package, repliclust, that implements this workflow. A demo of data generation from verbal inputs is available at https://demo.repliclust.org.</description>

      <title>Fast Distributed Inference Serving for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power a new generation of interactive AI applications exemplified by ChatGPT. The interactive nature of these applications demands low latency for LLM inference. Existing LLM serving systems use run-to-completion processing for inference jobs, which suffers from head-of-line blocking and long latency.
  We present FastServe, a distributed inference serving system for LLMs. FastServe exploits the autoregressive pattern of LLM inference to enable preemption at the granularity of each output token. FastServe uses preemptive scheduling to minimize latency with a novel skip-join Multi-Level Feedback Queue scheduler. Based on the new semi-information-agnostic setting of LLM inference, the scheduler leverages the input length information to assign an appropriate initial queue for each arrival job to join. The higher priority queues than the joined queue are skipped to reduce demotions. We design an efficient GPU memory management mechanism that proactively offloads and uploads intermediate state between GPU memory and host memory for LLM inference. We build a system prototype of FastServe and experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art solution vLLM, FastServe improves the throughput by up to 31.4x and 17.9x under the same average and tail latency requirements, respectively.</description>

Its two key components are: 1) the LocalTaylor wrapper which adapts Taylor approximations (used in dynamical systems) for use in neural network-based probabilistic models, and 2) the MHA-X attention block which makes predictions in a way inspired by how Gaussian Processes' mean predictions are linear smoothings of contextual data. Taylorformer outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of log-likelihood on 5/6 classic Neural Process tasks such as meta-learning 1D functions, and has at least a 14\% MSE improvement on forecasting tasks, including electricity, oil temperatures and exchange rates. Taylorformer approximates a consistent stochastic process and provides uncertainty-aware predictions. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Improving Time Series Encoding with Noise-Aware Self-Supervised Learning and an Efficient Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the time series representation learning problem using self-supervised techniques. Contrastive learning is well-known in this area as it is a powerful method for extracting information from the series and generating task-appropriate representations. Despite its proficiency in capturing time series characteristics, these techniques often overlook a critical factor - the inherent noise in this type of data, a consideration usually emphasized in general time series analysis. Moreover, there is a notable absence of attention to developing efficient yet lightweight encoder architectures, with an undue focus on delivering contrastive losses. Our work address these gaps by proposing an innovative training strategy that promotes consistent representation learning, accounting for the presence of noise-prone signals in natural time series. Furthermore, we propose an encoder architecture that incorporates dilated convolution within the Inception block, resulting in a scalable and robust network with a wide receptive field. Experimental findings underscore the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches across various tasks, including forecasting, classification, and abnormality detection. Notably, our method attains the top rank in over two-thirds of the classification UCR datasets, utilizing only 40% of the parameters compared to the second-best approach.

      <title>Batches Stabilize the Minimum Norm Risk in High Dimensional Overparameterized Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning algorithms that divide the data into batches are prevalent in many machine-learning applications, typically offering useful trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance. In this paper, we examine the benefits of batch-partitioning through the lens of a minimum-norm overparametrized linear regression model with isotropic Gaussian features. We suggest a natural small-batch version of the minimum-norm estimator and derive bounds on its quadratic risk. We then characterize the optimal batch size and show it is inversely proportional to the noise level, as well as to the overparametrization ratio. In contrast to minimum-norm, our estimator admits a stable risk behavior that is monotonically increasing in the overparametrization ratio, eliminating both the blowup at the interpolation point and the double-descent phenomenon. We further show that shrinking the batch minimum-norm estimator by a factor equal to the Weiner coefficient further stabilizes it and results in lower quadratic risk in all settings. Interestingly, we observe that the implicit regularization offered by the batch partition is partially explained by feature overlap between the batches. Our bound is derived via a novel combination of techniques, in particular normal approximation in the Wasserstein metric of noisy projections over random subspaces.</description>

      <title>Noise Stability Optimization for Finding Flat Minima: A Hessian-based Regularization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The training of over-parameterized neural networks has received much study in recent literature. An important consideration is the regularization of over-parameterized networks due to their highly nonconvex and nonlinear geometry. In this paper, we study noise injection algorithms, which can regularize the Hessian of the loss, leading to regions with flat loss surfaces. Specifically, by injecting isotropic Gaussian noise into the weight matrices of a neural network, we can obtain an approximately unbiased estimate of the trace of the Hessian. However, naively implementing the noise injection via adding noise to the weight matrices before backpropagation presents limited empirical improvements. To address this limitation, we design a two-point estimate of the Hessian penalty, which injects noise into the weight matrices along both positive and negative directions of the random noise. In particular, this two-point estimate eliminates the variance of the first-order Taylor's expansion term on the Hessian. We show a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the trace of the Hessian (and the radius of the weight space), which can be measured from data.
  We conduct a detailed experimental study to validate our approach and show that it can effectively regularize the Hessian and improve generalization. First, our algorithm can outperform prior approaches on sharpness-reduced training, delivering up to a 2.4% test accuracy increase for fine-tuning ResNets on six image classification datasets. Moreover, the trace of the Hessian reduces by 15.8%, and the largest eigenvalue is reduced by 9.7% with our approach. We also find that the regularization of the Hessian can be combined with weight decay and data augmentation, leading to stronger regularization. Second, our approach remains effective for improving generalization in pretraining multimodal CLIP models and chain-of-thought fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>OpenOOD v1.5: Enhanced Benchmark for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable operation of open-world intelligent systems. Despite the emergence of an increasing number of OOD detection methods, the evaluation inconsistencies present challenges for tracking the progress in this field. OpenOOD v1 initiated the unification of the OOD detection evaluation but faced limitations in scalability and usability. In response, this paper presents OpenOOD v1.5, a significant improvement from its predecessor that ensures accurate, standardized, and user-friendly evaluation of OOD detection methodologies. Notably, OpenOOD v1.5 extends its evaluation capabilities to large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, investigates full-spectrum OOD detection which is important yet underexplored, and introduces new features including an online leaderboard and an easy-to-use evaluator. This work also contributes in-depth analysis and insights derived from comprehensive experimental results, thereby enriching the knowledge pool of OOD detection methodologies. With these enhancements, OpenOOD v1.5 aims to drive advancements and offer a more robust and comprehensive evaluation benchmark for OOD detection research.</description>

      <title>Generating the Ground Truth: Synthetic Data for Soft Label and Label Noise Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-world classification tasks, label noise is an unavoidable issue that adversely affects the generalization error of machine learning models. Additionally, evaluating how methods handle such noise is complicated, as the effect label noise has on their performance cannot be accurately quantified without clean labels. Existing research on label noise typically relies on either noisy or oversimplified simulated data as a baseline, into which additional noise with known properties is injected. In this paper, we introduce SYNLABEL, a framework designed to address these limitations by creating noiseless datasets informed by real-world data. SYNLABEL supports defining a pre-specified or learned function as the ground truth function, which can then be used for generating new clean labels. Furthermore, by repeatedly resampling values for selected features within the domain of the function, evaluating the function and aggregating the resulting labels, each data point can be assigned a soft label or label distribution. These distributions capture the inherent uncertainty present in many real-world datasets and enable the direct injection and quantification of label noise. The generated datasets serve as a clean baseline of adjustable complexity, into which various types of noise can be introduced. Additionally, they facilitate research into soft label learning and related applications. We demonstrate the application of SYNLABEL, showcasing its ability to precisely quantify label noise and its improvement over existing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Learning characteristic parameters and dynamics of centrifugal pumps under multiphase flow using physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical submersible pumps (ESPs) are prevalently utilized as artificial lift systems in the oil and gas industry. These pumps frequently encounter multiphase flows comprising a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, water, and sediments. Such mixtures lead to the formation of emulsions, characterized by an effective viscosity distinct from that of the individual phases. Traditional multiphase flow meters, employed to assess these conditions, are burdened by high operational costs and susceptibility to degradation. To this end, this study introduces a physics-informed neural network (PINN) model designed to indirectly estimate the fluid properties, dynamic states, and crucial parameters of an ESP system. A comprehensive structural and practical identifiability analysis was performed to delineate the subset of parameters that can be reliably estimated through the use of intake and discharge pressure measurements from the pump. The efficacy of the PINN model was validated by estimating the unknown states and parameters using these pressure measurements as input data. Furthermore, the performance of the PINN model was benchmarked against the particle filter method utilizing both simulated and experimental data across varying water content scenarios. The comparative analysis suggests that the PINN model holds significant potential as a viable alternative to conventional multiphase flow meters, offering a promising avenue for enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs in ESP applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models inspired by dynamical transport of measure -- such as flows and diffusions -- construct a continuous-time map between two probability densities. Conventionally, one of these is the target density, only accessible through samples, while the other is taken as a simple base density that is data-agnostic. In this work, using the framework of stochastic interpolants, we formalize how to \textit{couple} the base and the target densities, whereby samples from the base are computed conditionally given samples from the target in a way that is different from (but does preclude) incorporating information about class labels or continuous embeddings. This enables us to construct dynamical transport maps that serve as conditional generative models. We show that these transport maps can be learned by solving a simple square loss regression problem analogous to the standard independent setting. We demonstrate the usefulness of constructing dependent couplings in practice through experiments in super-resolution and in-painting.</description>

Abstract: We introduce discriminator guidance in the setting of Autoregressive Diffusion Models. The use of a discriminator to guide a diffusion process has previously been used for continuous diffusion models, and in this work we derive ways of using a discriminator together with a pretrained generative model in the discrete case. First, we show that using an optimal discriminator will correct the pretrained model and enable exact sampling from the underlying data distribution. Second, to account for the realistic scenario of using a sub-optimal discriminator, we derive a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm which iteratively takes the predictions from the discriminator into account during the generation process. We test these approaches on the task of generating molecular graphs and show how the discriminator improves the generative performance over using only the pretrained model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have become a critical component in many applications of machine learning. However, standard approaches to training LLM require a large number of tightly interconnected accelerators, with devices exchanging gradients and other intermediate states at each optimization step. While it is difficult to build and maintain a single computing cluster hosting many accelerators, it might be easier to find several computing clusters each hosting a smaller number of devices. In this work, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm, Distributed Low-Communication (DiLoCo), that enables training of language models on islands of devices that are poorly connected. The approach is a variant of federated averaging, where the number of inner steps is large, the inner optimizer is AdamW, and the outer optimizer is Nesterov momentum. On the widely used C4 dataset, we show that DiLoCo on 8 workers performs as well as fully synchronous optimization while communicating 500 times less. DiLoCo exhibits great robustness to the data distribution of each worker. It is also robust to resources becoming unavailable over time, and vice versa, it can seamlessly leverage resources that become available during training.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamic Selection and Pricing of Out-of-Home Deliveries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Home delivery failures, traffic congestion, and relatively large handling times have a negative impact on the profitability of last-mile logistics. A potential solution is the delivery to parcel lockers or parcel shops, denoted by out-of-home (OOH) delivery. In the academic literature, models for OOH delivery were so far limited to static settings, contrasting with the sequential nature of the problem. We model the sequential decision-making problem of which OOH location to offer against what incentive for each incoming customer, taking into account future customer arrivals and choices. We propose Dynamic Selection and Pricing of OOH (DSPO), an algorithmic pipeline that uses a novel spatial-temporal state encoding as input to a convolutional neural network. We demonstrate the performance of our method by benchmarking it against two state-of-the-art approaches. Our extensive numerical study, guided by real-world data, reveals that DSPO can save 19.9%pt in costs compared to a situation without OOH locations, 7%pt compared to a static selection and pricing policy, and 3.8%pt compared to a state-of-the-art demand management benchmark. We provide comprehensive insights into the complex interplay between OOH delivery dynamics and customer behavior influenced by pricing strategies. The implications of our findings suggest practitioners to adopt dynamic selection and pricing policies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15161v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning aims to learn a series of tasks sequentially without forgetting the knowledge acquired from the previous ones. In this work, we propose the Hessian Aware Low-Rank Perturbation algorithm for continual learning. By modeling the parameter transitions along the sequential tasks with the weight matrix transformation, we propose to apply the low-rank approximation on the task-adaptive parameters in each layer of the neural networks. Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate the quantitative relationship between the Hessian and the proposed low-rank approximation. The approximation ranks are then globally determined according to the marginal increment of the empirical loss estimated by the layer-specific gradient and low-rank approximation error. Furthermore, we control the model capacity by pruning less important parameters to diminish the parameter growth. We conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including a dataset with large-scale tasks, and compare our method against some recent state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed method. Empirical results show that our method performs better on different benchmarks, especially in achieving task order robustness and handling the forgetting issue.

Abstract: We present Symphony, an $E(3)$-equivariant autoregressive generative model for 3D molecular geometries that iteratively builds a molecule from molecular fragments. Existing autoregressive models such as G-SchNet and G-SphereNet for molecules utilize rotationally invariant features to respect the 3D symmetries of molecules. In contrast, Symphony uses message-passing with higher-degree $E(3)$-equivariant features. This allows a novel representation of probability distributions via spherical harmonic signals to efficiently model the 3D geometry of molecules. We show that Symphony is able to accurately generate small molecules from the QM9 dataset, outperforming existing autoregressive models and approaching the performance of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Deep Ensembles Meets Quantile Regression: Uncertainty-aware Imputation for Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world time series data frequently have significant amounts of missing values, posing challenges for advanced analysis. A common approach to address this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which could brings a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges with high missing rates and moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method to estimate uncertainty with ensemble of quantile-regression-based task networks and then incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate imputations that is robust to high missing rates, but also is computationally efficient due to the fast training of its non-generative model. We examine the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets, the air quality and health-care datasets, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms other most of the baseline methods in making deterministic and probabilistic imputations. Compared with the diffusion method, CSDI, our approach can obtain comparable forecasting results which is better when more data is missing, and moreover consumes a much smaller computation overhead, yielding much faster training and test.</description>

      <title>Reducing Energy Bloat in Large Model Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training large AI models on numerous GPUs consumes a massive amount of energy, making power delivery one of the largest limiting factors in building and operating datacenters for AI workloads. However, we observe that not all energy consumed during training directly contributes to end-to-end throughput; a significant portion can be removed without slowing down training. We call this portion energy bloat.
  In this work, we identify two independent sources of energy bloat in large model training and propose Perseus, a training system that mitigates both. To do this, Perseus obtains the time--energy tradeoff frontier of a large model training job using an efficient graph cut-based algorithm, and schedules computation energy consumption across time to reduce both types of energy bloat. Evaluation on large models, including GPT-3 and Bloom, shows that Perseus reduces the energy consumption of large model training by up to 30% without any throughput loss or hardware modification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), vision transformers (ViTs), diffusion, and LLM-based multimodal models, are revolutionizing the entire machine learning lifecycle, from training to deployment. However, the substantial advancements in versatility and performance these models offer come at a significant cost in terms of hardware resources. To support the growth of these large models in a scalable and environmentally sustainable way, there has been a considerable focus on developing resource-efficient strategies. This survey delves into the critical importance of such research, examining both algorithmic and systemic aspects. It offers a comprehensive analysis and valuable insights gleaned from existing literature, encompassing a broad array of topics from cutting-edge model architectures and training/serving algorithms to practical system designs and implementations. The goal of this survey is to provide an overarching understanding of how current approaches are tackling the resource challenges posed by large foundation models and to potentially inspire future breakthroughs in this field.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Local-SGD Training for Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local stochastic gradient descent (Local-SGD), also referred to as federated averaging, is an approach to distributed optimization where each device performs more than one SGD update per communication. This work presents an empirical study of {\it asynchronous} Local-SGD for training language models; that is, each worker updates the global parameters as soon as it has finished its SGD steps. We conduct a comprehensive investigation by examining how worker hardware heterogeneity, model size, number of workers, and optimizer could impact the learning performance. We find that with naive implementations, asynchronous Local-SGD takes more iterations to converge than its synchronous counterpart despite updating the (global) model parameters more frequently. We identify momentum acceleration on the global parameters when worker gradients are stale as a key challenge. We propose a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training steps based on their computation speed. This approach, evaluated with models up to 150M parameters on the C4 dataset, matches the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step, and significantly surpasses it in terms of wall clock time.</description>

      <title>Early alignment in two-layer networks training is a two-edged sword</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training neural networks with first order optimisation methods is at the core of the empirical success of deep learning. The scale of initialisation is a crucial factor, as small initialisations are generally associated to a feature learning regime, for which gradient descent is implicitly biased towards simple solutions. This work provides a general and quantitative description of the early alignment phase, originally introduced by Maennel et al. (2018) . For small initialisation and one hidden ReLU layer networks, the early stage of the training dynamics leads to an alignment of the neurons towards key directions. This alignment induces a sparse representation of the network, which is directly related to the implicit bias of gradient flow at convergence. This sparsity inducing alignment however comes at the expense of difficulties in minimising the training objective: we also provide a simple data example for which overparameterised networks fail to converge towards global minima and only converge to a spurious stationary point instead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maritime transport is a pivotal logistics mode for the long-distance and bulk transportation of goods. However, the intricate planning involved in this mode is often hindered by uncertainties, including weather conditions, cargo diversity, and port dynamics, leading to increased costs. Consequently, accurate estimation of the total (stay) time of the vessel and any delays at the port are essential for efficient planning and scheduling of port operations. This study aims to develop predictive analytics to address the shortcomings in the previous works of port operations for a vessels Stay Time and Delay Time, offering a valuable contribution to the field of maritime logistics. The proposed solution is designed to assist decision making in port environments and predict service delays. This is demonstrated through a case study on Brazil's ports. Additionally, feature analysis is used to understand the key factors impacting maritime logistics, enhancing the overall understanding of the complexities involved in port operations. Furthermore, we perform Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis to interpret the effects of the features on the outcomes and understand their impact on each sample, providing deeper insights into the factors influencing port operations.</description>

      <title>RAMP: Boosting Adversarial Robustness Against Multiple $l_p$ Perturbations for Universal Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing works focus on improving robustness against adversarial attacks bounded by a single $l_p$ norm using adversarial training (AT). However, these AT models' multiple-norm robustness (union accuracy) is still low, which is crucial since in the real-world an adversary is not necessarily bounded by a single norm. The tradeoffs among robustness against multiple $l_p$ perturbations and accuracy/robustness make obtaining good union and clean accuracy challenging. We design a logit pairing loss to improve the union accuracy by analyzing the tradeoffs from the lens of distribution shifts. We connect natural training (NT) with AT via gradient projection, to incorporate useful information from NT into AT, where we empirically and theoretically show it moderates the accuracy/robustness tradeoff. We propose a novel training framework \textbf{RAMP}, to boost the robustness against multiple $l_p$ perturbations. \textbf{RAMP} can be easily adapted for robust fine-tuning and full AT. For robust fine-tuning, \textbf{RAMP} obtains a union accuracy up to $53.3\%$ on CIFAR-10, and $29.1\%$ on ImageNet. For training from scratch, \textbf{RAMP} achieves a union accuracy of $44.6\%$ and good clean accuracy of $81.2\%$ on ResNet-18 against AutoAttack on CIFAR-10. Beyond multi-norm robustness \textbf{RAMP}-trained models achieve superior \textit{universal robustness}, effectively generalizing against a range of unseen adversaries and natural corruptions.</description>

      <title>Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instructing the model to generate a sequence of intermediate steps, a.k.a., a chain of thought (CoT), is a highly effective method to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length $n$, previous works have shown that constant-depth transformers with finite precision $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ embedding size can only solve problems in $\mathsf{TC}^0$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can only solve problems in $\mathsf{AC}^0$, a proper subset of $ \mathsf{TC}^0$. However, with $T$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit precision and $O(\log n)$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size $T$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value problems, especially for low-depth transformers.</description>

      <title>From Zero to Hero: How local curvature at artless initial conditions leads away from bad minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an analytical study of the evolution of the Hessian during gradient descent dynamics, and relate a transition in its spectral properties to the ability of finding good minima. We focus on the phase retrieval problem as a case study for complex loss landscapes. We first characterize the high-dimensional limit where both the number $M$ and the dimension $N$ of the data are going to infinity at fixed signal-to-noise ratio $\alpha = M/N$. For small $\alpha$, the Hessian is uninformative with respect to the signal. For $\alpha$ larger than a critical value, the Hessian displays at short-times a downward direction pointing towards good minima. While descending, a transition in the spectrum takes place: the direction is lost and the system gets trapped in bad minima. Hence, the local landscape is benign and informative at first, before gradient descent brings the system into a uninformative maze. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we show that this dynamical transition plays a crucial role for finite (even very large) $N$: it allows the system to recover the signal well before the algorithmic threshold corresponding to the $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit. Our analysis sheds light on this new mechanism that facilitates gradient descent dynamics in finite dimensions, and highlights the importance of a good initialization based on spectral properties for optimization in complex high-dimensional landscapes.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free neural topology optimization: Towards effective fracture-resistant designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient-free optimizers allow for tackling problems regardless of the smoothness or differentiability of their objective function, but they require many more iterations to converge when compared to gradient-based algorithms. This has made them unviable for topology optimization due to the high computational cost per iteration and the high dimensionality of these problems. We propose a gradient-free neural topology optimization method using a pre-trained neural reparameterization strategy that addresses two key challenges in the literature. First, the method leads to at least one order of magnitude decrease in iteration count to reach minimum compliance when optimizing designs in latent space, as opposed to the conventional gradient-free approach without latent parameterization. This helps to bridge the large performance gap between gradient-free and gradient-based topology optimization for smooth and differentiable problems like compliance optimization, as demonstrated via extensive computational experiments in- and out-of-distribution with the training data. Second, we also show that the proposed method can optimize toughness of a structure undergoing brittle fracture more effectively than a traditional gradient-based optimizer, delivering an objective improvement in the order of 30% for all tested configurations. Although gradient-based topology optimization is more efficient for problems that are differentiable and well-behaved, such as compliance optimization, we believe that this work opens up a new path for problems where gradient-based algorithms have limitations.</description>

      <title>DiabetesNet: A Deep Learning Approach to Diabetes Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diabetes, resulting from inadequate insulin production or utilization, causes extensive harm to the body. Existing diagnostic methods are often invasive and come with drawbacks, such as cost constraints. Although there are machine learning models like Classwise k Nearest Neighbor (CkNN) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), they struggle with imbalanced data and result in under-performance. Leveraging advancements in sensor technology and machine learning, we propose a non-invasive diabetes diagnosis using a Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) with batch normalization, incorporating data re-sampling and normalization for class balancing. Our method addresses existing challenges such as limited performance associated with traditional machine learning. Experimental results on three datasets show significant improvements in overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to traditional methods. Notably, we achieve accuracies of 89.81% in Pima diabetes dataset, 75.49% in CDC BRFSS2015 dataset, and 95.28% in Mesra Diabetes dataset. This underscores the potential of deep learning models for robust diabetes diagnosis. See project website https://steve-zeyu-zhang.github.io/DiabetesDiagnosis/</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization With Across-Task Transferable Max-Value Entropy Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many applications, ranging from logistics to engineering, a designer is faced with a sequence of optimization tasks for which the objectives are in the form of black-box functions that are costly to evaluate. Furthermore, higher-fidelity evaluations of the optimization objectives often entail a larger cost. Existing multi-fidelity black-box optimization strategies select candidate solutions and fidelity levels with the goal of maximizing the information about the optimal value or the optimal solution for the current task. Assuming that successive optimization tasks are related, this paper introduces a novel information-theoretic acquisition function that balances the need to acquire information about the current task with the goal of collecting information transferable to future tasks. The proposed method transfers across tasks distributions over parameters of a Gaussian process surrogate model by implementing particle-based variational Bayesian updates. Theoretical insights based on the analysis of the expected regret substantiate the benefits of acquiring transferable knowledge across tasks. Furthermore, experimental results across synthetic and real-world examples reveal that the proposed acquisition strategy that caters to future tasks can significantly improve the optimization efficiency as soon as a sufficient number of tasks is processed.</description>

      <title>Projected Forward Gradient-Guided Frank-Wolfe Algorithm via Variance Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to enhance the use of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for training deep neural networks. Similar to any gradient-based optimization algorithm, FW suffers from high computational and memory costs when computing gradients for DNNs. This paper introduces the application of the recently proposed projected forward gradient (Projected-FG) method to the FW framework, offering reduced computational cost similar to backpropagation and low memory utilization akin to forward propagation. Our results show that trivial application of the Projected-FG introduces non-vanishing convergence error due to the stochastic noise that the Projected-FG method introduces in the process. This noise results in an non-vanishing variance in the Projected-FG estimated gradient. To address this, we propose a variance reduction approach by aggregating historical Projected-FG directions. We demonstrate rigorously that this approach ensures convergence to the optimal solution for convex functions and to a stationary point for non-convex functions. These convergence properties are validated through a numerical example, showcasing the approach's effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the Fragility of Active Learners for Text Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15744v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) techniques optimally utilize a labeling budget by iteratively selecting instances that are most valuable for learning. However, they lack ``prerequisite checks'', i.e., there are no prescribed criteria to pick an AL algorithm best suited for a dataset. A practitioner must pick a technique they \emph{trust} would beat random sampling, based on prior reported results, and hope that it is resilient to the many variables in their environment: dataset, labeling budget and prediction pipelines. The important questions then are: how often on average, do we expect any AL technique to reliably beat the computationally cheap and easy-to-implement strategy of random sampling? Does it at least make sense to use AL in an ``Always ON'' mode in a prediction pipeline, so that while it might not always help, it never under-performs random sampling? How much of a role does the prediction pipeline play in AL's success?
  We examine these questions in detail for the task of text classification using pre-trained representations, which are ubiquitous today.
  Our primary contribution here is a rigorous evaluation of AL techniques, old and new, across setups that vary wrt datasets, text representations and classifiers. This unlocks multiple insights around warm-up times, i.e., number of labels before gains from AL are seen, viability of an ``Always ON'' mode and the relative significance of different factors. Additionally, we release a framework for rigorous benchmarking of AL techniques for text classification.</description>

      <title>GeNet: A Graph Neural Network-based Anti-noise Task-Oriented Semantic Communication Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic communication tasks rely on the knowledge of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to mitigate channel noise. Moreover, these methods necessitate training under specific SNR conditions, entailing considerable time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose GeNet, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based paradigm for semantic communication aimed at combating noise, thereby facilitating Task-Oriented Communication (TOC). We propose a novel approach where we first transform the input data image into graph structures. Then we leverage a GNN-based encoder to extract semantic information from the source data. This extracted semantic information is then transmitted through the channel. At the receiver's end, a GNN-based decoder is utilized to reconstruct the relevant semantic information from the source data for TOC. Through experimental evaluation, we show GeNet's effectiveness in anti-noise TOC while decoupling the SNR dependency. We further evaluate GeNet's performance by varying the number of nodes, revealing its versatility as a new paradigm for semantic communication. Additionally, we show GeNet's robustness to geometric transformations by testing it with different rotation angles, without resorting to data augmentation.</description>

Abstract: With extensive pre-trained knowledge and high-level general capabilities, large language models (LLMs) emerge as a promising avenue to augment reinforcement learning (RL) in aspects such as multi-task learning, sample efficiency, and high-level task planning. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature in LLM-enhanced RL and summarize its characteristics compared to conventional RL methods, aiming to clarify the research scope and directions for future studies. Utilizing the classical agent-environment interaction paradigm, we propose a structured taxonomy to systematically categorize LLMs' functionalities in RL, including four roles: information processor, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator. For each role, we summarize the methodologies, analyze the specific RL challenges that are mitigated, and provide insights into future directions. Lastly, a comparative analysis of each role, potential applications, prospective opportunities, and challenges of the LLM-enhanced RL are discussed.

Abstract: Quantitative Structure Property Relationship studies aim to define a mapping between molecular structure and arbitrary quantities of interest. This was historically accomplished via the development of descriptors which requires significant domain expertise and struggles to generalize. Thus the field has morphed into Molecular Property Prediction and been given over to learned representations which are highly generalizable. The paper introduces fastprop, a DeepQSPR framework which uses a cogent set of molecular level descriptors to meet and exceed the performance of learned representations on diverse datasets in dramatically less time. fastprop is freely available on github at github.com/JacksonBurns/fastprop.</description>

      <title>Remote sensing framework for geological mapping via stacked autoencoders and clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02180v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning methods for geological mapping via remote sensing face limitations due to the scarcity of accurately labelled training data that can be addressed by unsupervised learning, such as dimensionality reduction and clustering. Dimensionality reduction methods have the potential to play a crucial role in improving the accuracy of geological maps. Although conventional dimensionality reduction methods may struggle with nonlinear data, unsupervised deep learning models such as autoencoders can model non-linear relationships. Stacked autoencoders feature multiple interconnected layers to capture hierarchical data representations useful for remote sensing data. We present an unsupervised machine learning-based framework for processing remote sensing data using stacked autoencoders for dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering for mapping geological units. We use Landsat 8, ASTER, and Sentinel-2 datasets to evaluate the framework for geological mapping of the Mutawintji region in Western New South Wales, Australia. We also compare stacked autoencoders with principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical autoencoders. Our results reveal that the framework produces accurate and interpretable geological maps, efficiently discriminating rock units. The results reveal that the combination of stacked autoencoders with Sentinel-2 data yields the best performance accuracy when compared to other combinations. We find that stacked autoencoders enable better extraction of complex and hierarchical representations of the input data when compared to canonical autoencoders and PCA. We also find that the generated maps align with prior geological knowledge of the study area while providing novel insights into geological structures.</description>

      <title>Four-hour thunderstorm nowcasting using deep diffusion models of satellite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convection (thunderstorm) develops rapidly within hours and is highly destructive, posing a significant challenge for nowcasting and resulting in substantial losses to nature and society. After the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, convection nowcasting has experienced rapid advancements, with its performance surpassing that of physics-based numerical weather prediction and other conventional approaches. However, the lead time and coverage of it still leave much to be desired and hardly meet the needs of disaster emergency response. Here, we propose deep diffusion models of satellite (DDMS) to establish an AI-based convection nowcasting system. On one hand, it employs diffusion processes to effectively simulate complicated spatiotemporal evolution patterns of convective clouds, significantly improving the forecast lead time. On the other hand, it utilizes geostationary satellite brightness temperature data, thereby achieving planetary-scale forecast coverage. During long-term tests and objective validation based on the FengYun-4A satellite, our system achieves, for the first time, effective convection nowcasting up to 4 hours, with broad coverage (about 20,000,000 km2), remarkable accuracy, and high resolution (15 minutes; 4 km). Its performance reaches a new height in convection nowcasting compared to the existing models. In terms of application, our system operates efficiently (forecasting 4 hours of convection in 8 minutes), and is highly transferable with the potential to collaborate with multiple satellites for global convection nowcasting. Furthermore, our results highlight the remarkable capabilities of diffusion models in convective clouds forecasting, as well as the significant value of geostationary satellite data when empowered by AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Predictive Model Development to Identify Failed Healing in Patients after Non-Union Fracture Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bone non-union is among the most severe complications associated with trauma surgery, occurring in 10-30% of cases after long bone fractures. Treating non-unions requires a high level of surgical expertise and often involves multiple revision surgeries, sometimes even leading to amputation. Thus, more accurate prognosis is crucial for patient well-being. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) hold promise for developing models to predict non-union healing, even when working with smaller datasets, a commonly encountered challenge in clinical domains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ML in identifying candidates at risk of failed non-union healing, we applied three ML models (logistic regression, support vector machine, and XGBoost) to the clinical dataset TRUFFLE, which includes 797 patients with long bone non-union. The models provided prediction results with 70% sensitivity, and the specificities of 66% (XGBoost), 49% (support vector machine), and 43% (logistic regression). These findings offer valuable clinical insights because they enable early identification of patients at risk of failed non-union healing after the initial surgical revision treatment protocol.</description>

      <title>Calibration Error for Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calibration allows predictions to be reliably interpreted as probabilities by decision makers. We propose a decision-theoretic calibration error, the Calibration Decision Loss (CDL), defined as the maximum improvement in decision payoff obtained by calibrating the predictions, where the maximum is over all payoff-bounded decision tasks. Vanishing CDL guarantees the payoff loss from miscalibration vanishes simultaneously for all downstream decision tasks. We show separations between CDL and existing calibration error metrics, including the most well-studied metric Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Our main technical contribution is a new efficient algorithm for online calibration that achieves near-optimal $O(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}})$ expected CDL, bypassing the $\Omega(T^{-0.472})$ lower bound for ECE by Qiao and Valiant (2021).</description>

      <title>Deep Evidential Learning for Radiotherapy Dose Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel application of an uncertainty-quantification framework called Deep Evidential Learning in the domain of radiotherapy dose prediction. Using medical images of the Open Knowledge-Based Planning Challenge dataset, we found that this model can be effectively harnessed to yield uncertainty estimates that inherited correlations with prediction errors upon completion of network training. This was achieved only after reformulating the original loss function for a stable implementation. We found that (i)epistemic uncertainty was highly correlated with prediction errors, with various association indices comparable or stronger than those for Monte-Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensemble methods, (ii)the median error varied with uncertainty threshold much more linearly for epistemic uncertainty in Deep Evidential Learning relative to these other two conventional frameworks, indicative of a more uniformly calibrated sensitivity to model errors, (iii)relative to epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty demonstrated a more significant shift in its distribution in response to Gaussian noise added to CT intensity, compatible with its interpretation as reflecting data noise. Collectively, our results suggest that Deep Evidential Learning is a promising approach that can endow deep-learning models in radiotherapy dose prediction with statistical robustness. Towards enhancing its clinical relevance, we demonstrate how we can use such a model to construct the predicted Dose-Volume-Histograms' confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Learned feature representations are biased by complexity, learning order, position, and more</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representation learning, and interpreting learned representations, are key areas of focus in machine learning and neuroscience. Both fields generally use representations as a means to understand or improve a system's computations. In this work, however, we explore surprising dissociations between representation and computation that may pose challenges for such efforts. We create datasets in which we attempt to match the computational role that different features play, while manipulating other properties of the features or the data. We train various deep learning architectures to compute these multiple abstract features about their inputs. We find that their learned feature representations are systematically biased towards representing some features more strongly than others, depending upon extraneous properties such as feature complexity, the order in which features are learned, and the distribution of features over the inputs. For example, features that are simpler to compute or learned first tend to be represented more strongly and densely than features that are more complex or learned later, even if all features are learned equally well. We also explore how these biases are affected by architectures, optimizers, and training regimes (e.g., in transformers, features decoded earlier in the output sequence also tend to be represented more strongly). Our results help to characterize the inductive biases of gradient-based representation learning. We then illustrate the downstream effects of these biases on various commonly-used methods for analyzing or intervening on representations. These results highlight a key challenge for interpretability $-$ or for comparing the representations of models and brains $-$ disentangling extraneous biases from the computationally important aspects of a system's internal representations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hallucination in Text, Image, Video, and Audio Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of foundation models (FMs) across language, image, audio, and video domains has shown remarkable capabilities in diverse tasks. However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely-used parameter-efficient finetuning method for large language models. LoRA saves memory by training only low rank perturbations to selected weight matrices. In this work, we compare the performance of LoRA and full finetuning on two target domains, programming and mathematics. We consider both the instruction finetuning (approximately 100K prompt-response pairs) and continued pretraining (20B unstructured tokens) data regimes. Our results show that, in the standard low-rank settings, LoRA substantially underperforms full finetuning. Nevertheless, LoRA better maintains the base model's performance on tasks outside the target domain. We show that LoRA mitigates forgetting more than common regularization techniques such as weight decay and dropout; it also helps maintain more diverse generations. Finally, we show that full finetuning learns perturbations with a rank that is 10-100X greater than typical LoRA configurations, possibly explaining some of the reported gaps. We conclude by proposing best practices for finetuning with LoRA.</description>

      <title>Text-Free Multi-domain Graph Pre-training: Toward Graph Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</description>

      <title>SF-DQN: Provable Knowledge Transfer using Successor Feature for Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the transfer reinforcement learning (RL) problem where multiple RL problems have different reward functions but share the same underlying transition dynamics. In this setting, the Q-function of each RL problem (task) can be decomposed into a successor feature (SF) and a reward mapping: the former characterizes the transition dynamics, and the latter characterizes the task-specific reward function. This Q-function decomposition, coupled with a policy improvement operator known as generalized policy improvement (GPI), reduces the sample complexity of finding the optimal Q-function, and thus the SF \&amp; GPI framework exhibits promising empirical performance compared to traditional RL methods like Q-learning. However, its theoretical foundations remain largely unestablished, especially when learning the successor features using deep neural networks (SF-DQN). This paper studies the provable knowledge transfer using SFs-DQN in transfer RL problems. We establish the first convergence analysis with provable generalization guarantees for SF-DQN with GPI. The theory reveals that SF-DQN with GPI outperforms conventional RL approaches, such as deep Q-network, in terms of both faster convergence rate and better generalization. Numerical experiments on real and synthetic RL tasks support the superior performance of SF-DQN \&amp; GPI, aligning with our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: We focus on the task of learning the value function in the reinforcement learning (RL) setting. This task is often solved by updating a pair of online and target networks while ensuring that the parameters of these two networks are equivalent. We propose Lookahead-Replicate (LR), a new value-function approximation algorithm that is agnostic to this parameter-space equivalence. Instead, the LR algorithm is designed to maintain an equivalence between the two networks in the function space. This value-based equivalence is obtained by employing a new target-network update. We show that LR leads to a convergent behavior in learning the value function. We also present empirical results demonstrating that LR-based target-network updates significantly improve deep RL on the Atari benchmark.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Optimized Synthetic EHR Generation for Arbitrary Downstream Predictive Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among various aspects of ensuring the responsible design of AI tools for healthcare applications, addressing fairness concerns has been a key focus area. Specifically, given the wide spread of electronic health record (EHR) data and their huge potential to inform a wide range of clinical decision support tasks, improving fairness in this category of health AI tools is of key importance. While such a broad problem (mitigating fairness in EHR-based AI models) has been tackled using various methods, task- and model-agnostic methods are noticeably rare. In this study, we aimed to target this gap by presenting a new pipeline that generates synthetic EHR data, which is not only consistent with (faithful to) the real EHR data but also can reduce the fairness concerns (defined by the end-user) in the downstream tasks, when combined with the real data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline across various downstream tasks and two different EHR datasets. Our proposed pipeline can add a widely applicable and complementary tool to the existing toolbox of methods to address fairness in health AI applications, such as those modifying the design of a downstream model.

      <title>GNNAnatomy: Systematic Generation and Evaluation of Multi-Level Explanations for Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in machine learning tasks involving graphs, such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. However, explaining their decision-making process is challenging due to the complex transformations GNNs perform by aggregating relational information from graph topology. Existing methods for explaining GNNs face key limitations: (1) lack of flexibility in generating explanations at varying levels, (2) difficulty in identifying unique substructures relevant to class differentiation, and (3) little support to ensure the trustworthiness of explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce GNNAnatomy, a visual analytics system designed to generate and evaluate multi-level GNN explanations for graph classification tasks. GNNAnatomy uses graphlets, primitive graph substructures, to identify the most critical substructures in a graph class by analyzing the correlation between GNN predictions and graphlet frequencies. These correlations are presented interactively for user-selected group of graphs through our visual analytics system. To further validate top-ranked graphlets, we measure the change in classification confidence after removing each graphlet from the original graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNAnatomy through case studies on synthetic and real-world graph datasets from sociology and biology domains. Additionally, we compare GNNAnatomy with state-of-the-art explainable GNN methods to showcase its utility and versatility.</description>

      <title>Set-CLIP: Exploring Aligned Semantic From Low-Alignment Multimodal Data Through A Distribution View</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal fusion breaks through the boundaries between diverse modalities and has already achieved notable performances. However, in many specialized fields, it is struggling to obtain sufficient alignment data for training, which seriously limits the use of previously effective models. Therefore, semi-supervised learning approaches are attempted to facilitate multimodal alignment by learning from low-alignment data with fewer matched pairs, but traditional techniques like pseudo-labeling may run into troubles in the label-deficient scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we reframe semi-supervised multimodal alignment as a manifold matching issue and propose a new methodology based on CLIP, termed Set-CLIP. Specifically, by designing a novel semantic density distribution loss, we constrain the latent representation distribution with fine granularity and extract implicit semantic alignment from unpaired multimodal data, thereby reducing the reliance on numerous strictly matched pairs. Furthermore, we apply coarse-grained modality adaptation and unimodal self-supervised guidance to narrow the gaps between modality spaces and improve the stability of representation distributions. Extensive experiments conducted on a range of tasks in various fields, including protein analysis, remote sensing, and the general vision-language field, validate the efficacy of our proposed Set-CLIP method. Especially with no paired data for supervised training, Set-CLIP is still outstanding, which brings an improvement of 144.83% over CLIP.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Horizon Reinforcement Learning with Multinomial Logistic Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study model-based reinforcement learning with non-linear function approximation where the transition function of the underlying Markov decision process (MDP) is given by a multinomial logistic (MNL) model. We develop a provably efficient discounted value iteration-based algorithm that works for both infinite-horizon average-reward and discounted-reward settings. For average-reward communicating MDPs, the algorithm guarantees a regret upper bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(dD\sqrt{T})$ where $d$ is the dimension of feature mapping, $D$ is the diameter of the underlying MDP, and $T$ is the horizon. For discounted-reward MDPs, our algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d(1-\gamma)^{-2}\sqrt{T})$ regret where $\gamma$ is the discount factor. Then we complement these upper bounds by providing several regret lower bounds. We prove a lower bound of $\Omega(d\sqrt{DT})$ for learning communicating MDPs of diameter $D$ and a lower bound of $\Omega(d(1-\gamma)^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ for learning discounted-reward MDPs with discount factor $\gamma$. Lastly, we show a regret lower bound of $\Omega(dH^{3/2}\sqrt{K})$ for learning $H$-horizon episodic MDPs with MNL function approximation where $K$ is the number of episodes, which improves upon the best-known lower bound for the finite-horizon setting.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks Against Time-Series Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing time-series data that contains personal information, particularly in the medical field, presents serious privacy concerns. Sensitive health data from patients is often used to train machine learning models for diagnostics and ongoing care. Assessing the privacy risk of such models is crucial to making knowledgeable decisions on whether to use a model in production or share it with third parties. Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) are a key method for this kind of evaluation, however time-series prediction models have not been thoroughly studied in this context. We explore existing MIA techniques on time-series models, and introduce new features, focusing on the seasonality and trend components of the data. Seasonality is estimated using a multivariate Fourier transform, and a low-degree polynomial is used to approximate trends. We applied these techniques to various types of time-series models, using datasets from the health domain. Our results demonstrate that these new features enhance the effectiveness of MIAs in identifying membership, improving the understanding of privacy risks in medical data applications.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Traffic Flow using Wavelet-based Temporal Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting of traffic flow data represents a typical problem in the field of machine learning, impacting urban traffic management systems. In general, spatiotemporal forecasting problems involve complex interactions, nonlinearities, and long-range dependencies due to the interwoven nature of the temporal and spatial dimensions. Due to this, traditional statistical and machine learning methods cannot adequately handle the temporal and spatial dependencies in these complex traffic flow datasets. A prevalent approach in the field combines graph convolutional networks and multi-head attention mechanisms for spatiotemporal processing. This paper proposes a wavelet-based temporal attention model, namely a wavelet-based dynamic spatiotemporal aware graph neural network (W-DSTAGNN), for tackling the traffic forecasting problem. Wavelet decomposition can help by decomposing the signal into components that can be analyzed independently, reducing the impact of non-stationarity and handling long-range dependencies of traffic flow datasets. Benchmark experiments using three popularly used statistical metrics confirm that our proposal efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations and outperforms ten state-of-the-art models (including both temporal and spatiotemporal benchmarks) on three publicly available traffic datasets. Our proposed ensemble method can better handle dynamic temporal and spatial dependencies and make reliable long-term forecasts. In addition to point forecasts, our proposed model can generate interval forecasts that significantly enhance probabilistic forecasting for traffic datasets.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Trees for Tabular Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite much work on advanced deep learning and generative modeling techniques for tabular data generation and imputation, traditional methods have continued to win on imputation benchmarks. We herein present UnmaskingTrees, a simple method for tabular imputation (and generation) employing gradient-boosted decision trees which are used to incrementally unmask individual features. This approach offers state-of-the-art performance on imputation, and on generation given training data with missingness; and it has competitive performance on vanilla generation. To solve the conditional generation subproblem, we propose a tabular probabilistic prediction method, BaltoBot, which fits a balanced tree of boosted tree classifiers. Unlike older methods, it requires no parametric assumption on the conditional distribution, accommodating features with multimodal distributions; unlike newer diffusion methods, it offers fast sampling, closed-form density estimation, and flexible handling of discrete variables. We finally consider our two approaches as meta-algorithms, demonstrating in-context learning-based generative modeling with TabPFN.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Health Technology Assessment: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Considerations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review introduces the transformative potential of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), for health technology assessment (HTA). We explore their applications in four critical areas, evidence synthesis, evidence generation, clinical trials and economic modeling: (1) Evidence synthesis: Generative AI has the potential to assist in automating literature reviews and meta-analyses by proposing search terms, screening abstracts, and extracting data with notable accuracy; (2) Evidence generation: These models can potentially facilitate automating the process and analyze the increasingly available large collections of real-world data (RWD), including unstructured clinical notes and imaging, enhancing the speed and quality of real-world evidence (RWE) generation; (3) Clinical trials: Generative AI can be used to optimize trial design, improve patient matching, and manage trial data more efficiently; and (4) Economic modeling: Generative AI can also aid in the development of health economic models, from conceptualization to validation, thus streamlining the overall HTA process. Despite their promise, these technologies, while rapidly improving, are still nascent and continued careful evaluation in their applications to HTA is required. To ensure their responsible use and implementation, both developers and users of research incorporating these tools, should familiarize themselves with their current limitations, including the issues related to scientific validity, risk of bias, and consider equity and ethical implications. We also surveyed the current policy landscape and provide suggestions for HTA agencies on responsibly integrating generative AI into their workflows, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and the fast-evolving nature of these tools.</description>

      <title>A Resolution Independent Neural Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Deep operator network (DeepONet) is a powerful yet simple neural operator architecture that utilizes two deep neural networks to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This architecture is highly flexible, allowing the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the desired domain. However, it imposes a strict constraint on the input space, requiring all input functions to be discretized at the same locations; this limits its practical applications. In this work, we introduce RINO, which provides a framework to make DeepONet resolution-independent, enabling it to handle input functions that are arbitrarily, but sufficiently finely, discretized. To this end, we propose two dictionary learning algorithms to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from correlated signals defined on arbitrary point cloud data. These basis functions are then used to project arbitrary input function data as a point cloud onto an embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions) with dimensionality equal to the dictionary size, which DeepONet can directly use without any architectural changes. In particular, we utilize sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as trainable INR basis functions. The introduced dictionary learning algorithms can be used in a similar way to learn an appropriate dictionary of basis functions for the output function data. This approach can be seen as an extension of POD DeepONet for cases where the realizations of the output functions have different discretizations, making the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) approach inapplicable. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of RINO in handling arbitrarily (but sufficiently richly) sampled input and output functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Fair Overlap Number of Balls (Fair-ONB): A Data-Morphology-based Undersampling Method for Bias Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key issues regarding classification problems in Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence is ensuring Fairness in the prediction of different classes when protected (sensitive) features are present. Data quality is critical in these cases, as biases in training data can be reflected in machine learning, impacting human lives and failing to comply with current regulations. One strategy to improve data quality and avoid these problems is preprocessing the dataset. Instance selection via undersampling can foster balanced learning of classes and protected feature values. Performing undersampling in class overlap areas close to the decision boundary should bolster the impact on the classifier. This work proposes Fair Overlap Number of Balls (Fair-ONB), an undersampling method that harnesses the data morphology of the different data groups (obtained from the combination of classes and protected feature values) to perform guided undersampling in overlap areas. It employs attributes of the ball coverage of the groups, such as the radius, number of covered instances and density, to select the most suitable areas for undersampling and reduce bias. Results show that the Fair-ONB method improves model Fairness with low impact on the classifier's predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Indoor Air Quality Dataset with Activities of Daily Living in Low to Middle-income Communities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, indoor air pollution has posed a significant threat to our society, claiming over 3.2 million lives annually. Developing nations, such as India, are most affected since lack of knowledge, inadequate regulation, and outdoor air pollution lead to severe daily exposure to pollutants. However, only a limited number of studies have attempted to understand how indoor air pollution affects developing countries like India. To address this gap, we present spatiotemporal measurements of air quality from 30 indoor sites over six months during summer and winter seasons. The sites are geographically located across four regions of type: rural, suburban, and urban, covering the typical low to middle-income population in India. The dataset contains various types of indoor environments (e.g., studio apartments, classrooms, research laboratories, food canteens, and residential households), and can provide the basis for data-driven learning model research aimed at coping with unique pollution patterns in developing countries. This unique dataset demands advanced data cleaning and imputation techniques for handling missing data due to power failure or network outages during data collection. Furthermore, through a simple speech-to-text application, we provide real-time indoor activity labels annotated by occupants. Therefore, environmentalists and ML enthusiasts can utilize this dataset to understand the complex patterns of the pollutants under different indoor activities, identify recurring sources of pollution, forecast exposure, improve floor plans and room structures of modern indoor designs, develop pollution-aware recommender systems, etc.</description>

      <title>Evaluating language models as risk scores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current question-answering benchmarks predominantly focus on accuracy in realizable prediction tasks. Conditioned on a question and answer-key, does the most likely token match the ground truth? Such benchmarks necessarily fail to evaluate LLMs' ability to quantify ground-truth outcome uncertainty. In this work, we focus on the use of LLMs as risk scores for unrealizable prediction tasks. We introduce folktexts, a software package to systematically generate risk scores using LLMs, and evaluate them against US Census data products. A flexible API enables the use of different prompting schemes, local or web-hosted models, and diverse census columns that can be used to compose custom prediction tasks. We evaluate 17 recent LLMs across five proposed benchmark tasks. We find that zero-shot risk scores produced by multiple-choice question-answering have high predictive signal but are widely miscalibrated. Base models consistently overestimate outcome uncertainty, while instruction-tuned models underestimate uncertainty and produce over-confident risk scores. In fact, instruction-tuning polarizes answer distribution regardless of true underlying data uncertainty. This reveals a general inability of instruction-tuned LLMs to express data uncertainty using multiple-choice answers. A separate experiment using verbalized chat-style risk queries yields substantially improved calibration across instruction-tuned models. These differences in ability to quantify data uncertainty cannot be revealed in realizable settings, and highlight a blind-spot in the current evaluation ecosystem that folktexts covers.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT), a simple and effective methodology for highly efficient and accurate LLM training with extremely long sequences. MsT partitions input sequences and iteratively processes mini-sequences to reduce intermediate memory usage. Integrated with activation recomputation, it enables significant memory savings in both forward and backward passes. In experiments with the Llama3-8B model, with MsT, we measure no degradation in throughput or convergence even with 12x longer sequences than standard implementations. MsT is fully general, implementation-agnostic, and requires minimal code changes to integrate with existing LLM training frameworks. Integrated with the huggingface library, MsT successfully extends the maximum context length of Qwen, Mistral, and Gemma-2 by 12-24x.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Regret for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear--Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions, where states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent but volatilities of the state processes depend on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an actor-critic algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</description>

Abstract: High-quality representation of transactional sequences is vital for modern banking applications, including risk management, churn prediction, and personalized customer offers. Different tasks require distinct representation properties: local tasks benefit from capturing the client's current state, while global tasks rely on general behavioral patterns. Previous research has demonstrated that various self-supervised approaches yield representations that better capture either global or local qualities.
  This study investigates the integration of two self-supervised learning techniques - instance-wise contrastive learning and a generative approach based on restoring masked events in latent space. The combined approach creates representations that balance local and global transactional data characteristics. Experiments conducted on several public datasets, focusing on sequence classification and next-event type prediction, show that the integrated method achieves superior performance compared to individual approaches and demonstrates synergistic effects. These findings suggest that the proposed approach offers a robust framework for advancing event sequences representation learning in the financial sector.</description>

Abstract: DNA storage technology offers new possibilities for addressing massive data storage due to its high storage density, long-term preservation, low maintenance cost, and compact size. To improve the reliability of stored information, base errors and missing storage sequences are challenges that must be faced. Currently, clustering and comparison of sequenced sequences are employed to recover the original sequence information as much as possible. Nonetheless, extracting DNA sequences of different lengths as features leads to the curse of dimensionality, which needs to be overcome. To address this, techniques like PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE are commonly employed to project high-dimensional features into low-dimensional space. Considering that these methods exhibit varying effectiveness in dimensionality reduction when dealing with different datasets, this paper proposes training a multilayer perceptron model to classify input DNA sequence features and adaptively select the most suitable dimensionality reduction method to enhance subsequent clustering results. Through testing on open-source datasets and comparing our approach with various baseline methods, experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior classification performance and significantly improves clustering outcomes. This displays that our approach effectively mitigates the impact of the curse of dimensionality on clustering models.</description>

      <title>Verification of Geometric Robustness of Neural Networks via Piecewise Linear Approximation and Lipschitz Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of verifying neural networks against geometric transformations of the input image, including rotation, scaling, shearing, and translation. The proposed method computes provably sound piecewise linear constraints for the pixel values by using sampling and linear approximations in combination with branch-and-bound Lipschitz optimisation. The method obtains provably tighter over-approximations of the perturbation region than the present state-of-the-art. We report results from experiments on a comprehensive set of verification benchmarks on MNIST and CIFAR10. We show that our proposed implementation resolves up to 32% more verification cases than present approaches.</description>

      <title>SORSA: Singular Values and Orthonormal Regularized Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) comes with a significant increase in their parameter size, presenting challenges for adaptation and fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to adapt LLMs for downstream tasks efficiently. In this paper, we propose Singular Values and Orthonormal Regularized Singular Vectors Adaptation, or SORSA, a novel PEFT method. We introduce a method to analyze the variation of the parameters by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) and discuss and analyze SORSA's superiority in minimizing the alteration in the SVD aspect. Each SORSA adapter consists of two main parts: trainable principal singular weights $W_p = U_p \Sigma_p V^\top_p$, and frozen residual weights $W_r = U_r \Sigma_r V^\top_r$. These parts are initialized by performing SVD on pre-trained weights. Moreover, we implement and analyze an orthonormal regularizer, which we prove could decrease the condition number of $W_p$ and allows the optimization to be more efficient. SORSA adapters could be merged during inference, thus eliminating any inference latency. After all, SORSA shows a faster convergence than PiSSA and LoRA in our experiments. On the MATH benchmark, Llama 2 7B adapted using SORSA achieved 10.36% accuracy, outperforming LoRA (5.50%), Full FT (7.22%), and PiSSA (7.44%). On the GSM-8K benchmark, SORSA achieved 56.03% accuracy, surpassing LoRA (42.30%), Full FT (49.05%), and PiSSA (53.07%). We conclude that SORSA offers a new perspective on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, demonstrating remarkable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/Gunale0926/SORSA</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Efficient Reward Function Searchers for Custom-Environment Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving the effective design and improvement of reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks with complex custom environments and multiple requirements presents considerable challenges. In this paper, we propose ERFSL, an efficient reward function searcher using LLMs, which enables LLMs to be effective white-box searchers and highlights their advanced semantic understanding capabilities. Specifically, we generate reward components for each numerically explicit user requirement and employ a reward critic to identify the correct code form. Then, LLMs assign weights to the reward components to balance their values and iteratively adjust the weights without ambiguity and redundant adjustments by flexibly adopting directional mutation and crossover strategies, similar to genetic algorithms, based on the context provided by the training log analyzer. We applied the framework to an underwater data collection RL task without direct human feedback or reward examples (zero-shot learning). The reward critic successfully corrects the reward code with only one feedback instance for each requirement, effectively preventing unrectifiable errors. The initialization of weights enables the acquisition of different reward functions within the Pareto solution set without the need for weight search. Even in cases where a weight is 500 times off, on average, only 5.2 iterations are needed to meet user requirements. The ERFSL also works well with most prompts utilizing GPT-4o mini, as we decompose the weight searching process to reduce the requirement for numerical and long-context understanding capabilities</description>

      <title>Masked Diffusion Models are Secretly Time-Agnostic Masked Models and Exploit Inaccurate Categorical Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a popular research topic for generative modeling of discrete data, thanks to their superior performance over other discrete diffusion models, and are rivaling the auto-regressive models (ARMs) for language modeling tasks. The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that the numerical issue lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</description>

      <title>CubicML: Automated ML for Large ML Systems Co-design with ML Prediction of Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling up deep learning models has been proven effective to improve intelligence of machine learning (ML) models, especially for industry recommendation models and large language models. The co-design of large distributed ML systems and algorithms (to maximize training performance) plays a pivotal role for its success. As it scales, the number of co-design hyper-parameters grows rapidly which brings challenges to feasibly find the optimal setup for system performance maximization. In this paper, we propose CubicML which uses ML to automatically optimize training performance of large distributed ML systems. In CubicML, we use an ML model as a proxy to predict the training performance for search efficiency and performance modeling flexibility. We proved that CubicML can effectively optimize training speed of in-house ads recommendation models with 73 billion parameters and large language models up to 405 billion parameters at Meta.</description>

      <title>OPAL: Outlier-Preserved Microscaling Quantization Accelerator for Generative Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To overcome the burden on the memory size and bandwidth due to ever-increasing size of large language models (LLMs), aggressive weight quantization has been recently studied, while lacking research on quantizing activations. In this paper, we present a hardware-software co-design method that results in an energy-efficient LLM accelerator, named OPAL, for generation tasks. First of all, a novel activation quantization method that leverages the microscaling data format while preserving several outliers per sub-tensor block (e.g., four out of 128 elements) is proposed. Second, on top of preserving outliers, mixed precision is utilized that sets 5-bit for inputs to sensitive layers in the decoder block of an LLM, while keeping inputs to less sensitive layers to 3-bit. Finally, we present the OPAL hardware architecture that consists of FP units for handling outliers and vectorized INT multipliers for dominant non-outlier related operations. In addition, OPAL uses log2-based approximation on softmax operations that only requires shift and subtraction to maximize power efficiency. As a result, we are able to improve the energy efficiency by 1.6~2.2x, and reduce the area by 2.4~3.1x with negligible accuracy loss, i.e., &lt;1 perplexity increase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is the task of inferring the implicit constraints followed by expert agents from their demonstration data. As an emerging research topic, ICRL has received considerable attention in recent years. This article presents a categorical survey of the latest advances in ICRL. It serves as a comprehensive reference for machine learning researchers and practitioners, as well as starters seeking to comprehend the definitions, advancements, and important challenges in ICRL. We begin by formally defining the problem and outlining the algorithmic framework that facilitates constraint inference across various scenarios. These include deterministic or stochastic environments, environments with limited demonstrations, and multiple agents. For each context, we illustrate the critical challenges and introduce a series of fundamental methods to tackle these issues. This survey encompasses discrete, virtual, and realistic environments for evaluating ICRL agents. We also delve into the most pertinent applications of ICRL, such as autonomous driving, robot control, and sports analytics. To stimulate continuing research, we conclude the survey with a discussion of key unresolved questions in ICRL that can effectively foster a bridge between theoretical understanding and practical industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Increasing Both Batch Size and Learning Rate Accelerates Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strongly depends on setting the batch size and learning rate to minimize the empirical loss in training the deep neural network. In this paper, we present theoretical analyses of mini-batch SGD with four schedulers: (i) constant batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (ii) increasing batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (iii) increasing batch size and increasing learning rate scheduler, and (iv) increasing batch size and warm-up decaying learning rate scheduler. We show that mini-batch SGD using scheduler (i) does not always minimize the expectation of the full gradient norm of the empirical loss, whereas it does using any of schedulers (ii), (iii), and (iv). Furthermore, schedulers (iii) and (iv) accelerate mini-batch SGD. The paper also provides numerical results of supporting analyses showing that using scheduler (iii) or (iv) minimizes the full gradient norm of the empirical loss faster than using scheduler (i) or (ii).</description>

      <title>CSKV: Training-Efficient Channel Shrinking for KV Cache in Long-Context Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to process long-context tasks. However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses significant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV cache compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning, which have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe performance degradation. Other methods design new architectures with less KV overhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two drawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply an architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce CSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache compression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV cache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the channel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank decomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features. (2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including a window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache. (3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs. Extensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV cache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover, we show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further reduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in OOD Detection: Problems and Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to detect test samples outside the training category space, which is an essential component in building reliable machine learning systems. Existing reviews on OOD detection primarily focus on method taxonomy, surveying the field by categorizing various approaches. However, many recent works concentrate on non-traditional OOD detection scenarios, such as test-time adaptation, multi-modal data sources and other novel contexts. In this survey, we uniquely review recent advances in OOD detection from the problem scenario perspective for the first time. According to whether the training process is completely controlled, we divide OOD detection methods into training-driven and training-agnostic. Besides, considering the rapid development of pre-trained models, large pre-trained model-based OOD detection is also regarded as an important category and discussed separately. Furthermore, we provide a discussion of the evaluation scenarios, a variety of applications, and several future research directions. We believe this survey with new taxonomy will benefit the proposal of new methods and the expansion of more practical scenarios.

      <title>Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement learning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them in complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus on ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while maintaining safer behavior during training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of AI applications, especially in large-scale wireless networks, is growing exponentially, alongside the size and complexity of the architectures used. Particularly, machine learning is acknowledged as one of today's most energy-intensive computational applications, posing a significant challenge to the environmental sustainability of next-generation intelligent systems. Achieving environmental sustainability entails ensuring that every AI algorithm is designed with sustainability in mind, integrating green considerations from the architectural phase onwards. Recently, Federated Learning (FL), with its distributed nature, presents new opportunities to address this need. Hence, it's imperative to elucidate the potential and challenges stemming from recent FL advancements and their implications for sustainability. Moreover, it's crucial to furnish researchers, stakeholders, and interested parties with a roadmap to navigate and understand existing efforts and gaps in green-aware AI algorithms. This survey primarily aims to achieve this objective by identifying and analyzing over a hundred FL works, assessing their contributions to green-aware artificial intelligence for sustainable environments, with a specific focus on IoT research. It delves into current issues in green federated learning from an energy-efficient standpoint, discussing potential challenges and future prospects for green IoT application research.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual inference for sequential experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06891v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider after-study statistical inference for sequentially designed experiments wherein multiple units are assigned treatments for multiple time points using treatment policies that adapt over time. Our goal is to provide inference guarantees for the counterfactual mean at the smallest possible scale -- mean outcome under different treatments for each unit and each time -- with minimal assumptions on the adaptive treatment policy. Without any structural assumptions on the counterfactual means, this challenging task is infeasible due to more unknowns than observed data points. To make progress, we introduce a latent factor model over the counterfactual means that serves as a non-parametric generalization of the non-linear mixed effects model and the bilinear latent factor model considered in prior works. For estimation, we use a non-parametric method, namely a variant of nearest neighbors, and establish a non-asymptotic high probability error bound for the counterfactual mean for each unit and each time. Under regularity conditions, this bound leads to asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the counterfactual mean as the number of units and time points grows to $\infty$ together at suitable rates. We illustrate our theory via several simulations and a case study involving data from a mobile health clinical trial HeartSteps.</description>

Abstract: Modern multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models have shown competitive results in learning visual representations without self-attention. However, existing MLP models are not good at capturing local details and lack prior knowledge of human body configurations, which limits their modeling power for skeletal representation learning. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective graph-reinforced MLP-Like architecture, named GraphMLP, that combines MLPs and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in a global-local-graphical unified architecture for 3D human pose estimation. GraphMLP incorporates the graph structure of human bodies into an MLP model to meet the domain-specific demand of the 3D human pose, while allowing for both local and global spatial interactions. Furthermore, we propose to flexibly and efficiently extend the GraphMLP to the video domain and show that complex temporal dynamics can be effectively modeled in a simple way with negligible computational cost gains in the sequence length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MLP-Like architecture for 3D human pose estimation in a single frame and a video sequence. Extensive experiments show that the proposed GraphMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

      <title>Distributed Differentiable Dynamic Game for Multi-robot Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08892v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a Distributed Differentiable Dynamic Game (D3G) framework, which can efficiently solve the forward and inverse problems in multi-robot coordination. We formulate multi-robot coordination as a dynamic game, where the behavior of a robot is dictated by its own dynamics and objective that also depends on others' behavior. In the forward problem, D3G enables all robots collaboratively to seek the Nash equilibrium of the game in a distributed manner, by developing a distributed shooting-based Nash solver. In the inverse problem, where each robot aims to find (learn) its objective (and dynamics) parameters to mimic given coordination demonstrations, D3G proposes a differentiation solver based on Differential Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, which allows each robot to update its parameters in a distributed and coordinated manner. We test the D3G in simulation with two types of robots given different task configurations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of D3G for solving both forward and inverse problems in comparison with existing methods.</description>

      <title>FIRE: A Failure-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Edge Computing Migrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In edge computing, users' service profiles are migrated due to user mobility. Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been proposed to do so, often trained on simulated data. However, existing RL frameworks overlook occasional server failures, which although rare, impact latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and real-time obstacle detection. Nevertheless, these failures (rare events), being not adequately represented in historical training data, pose a challenge for data-driven RL algorithms. As it is impractical to adjust failure frequency in real-world applications for training, we introduce FIRE, a framework that adapts to rare events by training a RL policy in an edge computing digital twin environment. We propose ImRE, an importance sampling-based Q-learning algorithm, which samples rare events proportionally to their impact on the value function. FIRE considers delay, migration, failure, and backup placement costs across individual and shared service profiles. We prove ImRE's boundedness and convergence to optimality. Next, we introduce novel deep Q-learning (ImDQL) and actor critic (ImACRE) versions of our algorithm to enhance scalability. We extend our framework to accommodate users with varying risk tolerances. Through trace driven experiments, we show that FIRE reduces costs compared to vanilla RL and the greedy baseline in the event of failures.</description>

      <title>Data Subsampling for Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms do not scale well for large datasets leading to difficulties in Neural Network posterior sampling. In this paper, we propose Penalty Bayesian Neural Networks - PBNNs, as a new algorithm that allows the evaluation of the likelihood using subsampled batch data (mini-batches) in a Bayesian inference context towards addressing scalability. PBNN avoids the biases inherent in other naive subsampling techniques by incorporating a penalty term as part of a generalization of the Metropolis Hastings algorithm. We show that it is straightforward to integrate PBNN with existing MCMC frameworks, as the variance of the loss function merely reduces the acceptance probability. By comparing with alternative sampling strategies on both synthetic data and the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that PBNN achieves good predictive performance even for small mini-batch sizes of data. We show that PBNN provides a novel approach for calibrating the predictive distribution by varying the mini-batch size, significantly reducing predictive overconfidence.</description>

      <title>Single-Trajectory Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To mitigate the limitation that the classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework heavily relies on identical training and test environments, Distributionally Robust RL (DRRL) has been proposed to enhance performance across a range of environments, possibly including unknown test environments. As a price for robustness gain, DRRL involves optimizing over a set of distributions, which is inherently more challenging than optimizing over a fixed distribution in the non-robust case. Existing DRRL algorithms are either model-based or fail to learn from a single sample trajectory. In this paper, we design a first fully model-free DRRL algorithm, called distributionally robust Q-learning with single trajectory (DRQ). We delicately design a multi-timescale framework to fully utilize each incrementally arriving sample and directly learn the optimal distributionally robust policy without modelling the environment, thus the algorithm can be trained along a single trajectory in a model-free fashion. Despite the algorithm's complexity, we provide asymptotic convergence guarantees by generalizing classical stochastic approximation tools. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superior robustness and sample complexity of our proposed algorithm, compared to non-robust methods and other robust RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Universal distribution of the empirical coverage in split conformal prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When split conformal prediction operates in batch mode with exchangeable data, we determine the exact distribution of the empirical coverage of prediction sets produced for a finite batch of future observables, as well as the exact distribution of its almost sure limit when the batch size goes to infinity. Both distributions are universal, being determined solely by the nominal miscoverage level and the calibration sample size, thereby establishing a criterion for choosing the minimum required calibration sample size in applications.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Learning and Optimal Policy Design in Multi-Agent MDPs Under Probabilistic Agent Dropout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) that can undergo agent dropout and the computation of policies for the post-dropout system based on control and sampling of the pre-dropout system. The central planner's objective is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the value of the expected system given a priori knowledge of the agents' dropout probabilities. For MDPs with a certain transition independence and reward separability structure, we assume that removing agents from the system forms a new MDP comprised of the remaining agents with new state and action spaces, transition dynamics that marginalize the removed agents, and rewards that are independent of the removed agents. We first show that under these assumptions, the value of the expected post-dropout system can be represented by a single MDP; this "robust MDP" eliminates the need to evaluate all $2^N$ realizations of the system, where N denotes the number of agents. More significantly, in a model-free context, it is shown that the robust MDP value can be estimated with samples generated by the pre-dropout system, meaning that robust policies can be found before dropout occurs. This fact is used to propose a policy importance sampling (IS) routine that performs policy evaluation for dropout scenarios while controlling the existing system with good pre-dropout policies. The policy IS routine produces value estimates for both the robust MDP and specific post-dropout system realizations and is justified with exponential confidence bounds. Finally, the utility of this approach is verified in simulation, showing how structural properties of agent dropout can help a controller find good post-dropout policies before dropout occurs.</description>

      <title>3D Reconstruction of Objects in Hands without Real World 3D Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior works for reconstructing hand-held objects from a single image train models on images paired with 3D shapes. Such data is challenging to gather in the real world at scale. Consequently, these approaches do not generalize well when presented with novel objects in in-the-wild settings. While 3D supervision is a major bottleneck, there is an abundance of a) in-the-wild raw video data showing hand-object interactions and b) synthetic 3D shape collections. In this paper, we propose modules to leverage 3D supervision from these sources to scale up the learning of models for reconstructing hand-held objects. Specifically, we extract multiview 2D mask supervision from videos and 3D shape priors from shape collections. We use these indirect 3D cues to train occupancy networks that predict the 3D shape of objects from a single RGB image. Our experiments in the challenging object generalization setting on in-the-wild MOW dataset show 11.6% relative improvement over models trained with 3D supervision on existing datasets.</description>

      <title>The Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge: Local Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A myriad of algorithms for the automatic analysis of brain MR images is available to support clinicians in their decision-making. For brain tumor patients, the image acquisition time series typically starts with an already pathological scan. This poses problems, as many algorithms are designed to analyze healthy brains and provide no guarantee for images featuring lesions. Examples include, but are not limited to, algorithms for brain anatomy parcellation, tissue segmentation, and brain extraction. To solve this dilemma, we introduce the BraTS inpainting challenge. Here, the participants explore inpainting techniques to synthesize healthy brain scans from lesioned ones. The following manuscript contains the task formulation, dataset, and submission procedure. Later, it will be updated to summarize the findings of the challenge. The challenge is organized as part of the ASNR-BraTS MICCAI challenge.</description>

      <title>Large language models in biomedical natural language processing: benchmarks, baselines, and recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical literature is growing rapidly, making it challenging to curate and extract knowledge manually. Biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) techniques that can automatically extract information from biomedical literature help alleviate this burden. Recently, large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, have gained significant attention for their impressive performance. However, their effectiveness in BioNLP tasks and impact on method development and downstream users remain understudied. This pilot study (1) establishes the baseline performance of GPT-3 and GPT-4 at both zero-shot and one-shot settings in eight BioNLP datasets across four applications: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, and semantic similarity and reasoning, (2) examines the errors produced by the LLMs and categorized the errors into three types: missingness, inconsistencies, and unwanted artificial content, and (3) provides suggestions for using LLMs in BioNLP applications. We make the datasets, baselines, and results publicly available to the community via https://github.com/qingyu-qc/gpt_bionlp_benchmark.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Equality Embedded Deep Lagrange Dual for Approximate Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06674v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional solvers are often computationally expensive for constrained optimization, particularly in large-scale and time-critical problems. While this leads to a growing interest in using neural networks (NNs) as fast optimal solution approximators, incorporating the constraints with NNs is challenging. In this regard, we propose deep Lagrange dual with equality embedding (DeepLDE), a framework that learns to find an optimal solution without using labels. To ensure feasible solutions, we embed equality constraints into the NNs and train the NNs using the primal-dual method to impose inequality constraints. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of DeepLDE and show that the primal-dual learning method alone cannot ensure equality constraints without the help of equality embedding. Simulation results on convex, non-convex, and AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problems show that the proposed DeepLDE achieves the smallest optimality gap among all the NN-based approaches while always ensuring feasible solutions. Furthermore, the computation time of the proposed method is about 5 to 250 times faster than DC3 and the conventional solvers in solving constrained convex, non-convex optimization, and/or AC-OPF.</description>

      <title>Continual Adaptation of Vision Transformers for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the important yet understudied problem of Continual Federated Learning (CFL), where a server communicates with a set of clients to incrementally learn new concepts over time without sharing or storing any data. The complexity of this problem is compounded by challenges from both the Continual and Federated Learning perspectives. Specifically, models trained in a CFL setup suffer from catastrophic forgetting which is exacerbated by data heterogeneity across clients. Existing attempts at this problem tend to impose large overheads on clients and communication channels or require access to stored data which renders them unsuitable for real-world use due to privacy. In this paper, we attempt to tackle forgetting and heterogeneity while minimizing overhead costs and without requiring access to any stored data. We study this problem in the context of Vision Transformers and explore parameter-efficient approaches to adapt to dynamic distributions while minimizing forgetting. We achieve this by leveraging a prompting based approach (such that only prompts and classifier heads have to be communicated) and proposing a novel and lightweight generation and distillation scheme to consolidate client models at the server. We formulate this problem for image classification and establish strong baselines for comparison, conduct experiments on CIFAR-100 as well as challenging, large-scale datasets like ImageNet-R and DomainNet. Our approach outperforms both existing methods and our own baselines by as much as 7% while significantly reducing communication and client-level computation costs.

      <title>Adaptive Multi-head Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contrastive learning, two views of an original image, generated by different augmentations, are considered a positive pair, and their similarity is required to be high. Similarly, two views of distinct images form a negative pair, with encouraged low similarity. Typically, a single similarity measure, provided by a lone projection head, evaluates positive and negative sample pairs. However, due to diverse augmentation strategies and varying intra-sample similarity, views from the same image may not always be similar. Additionally, owing to inter-sample similarity, views from different images may be more akin than those from the same image. Consequently, enforcing high similarity for positive pairs and low similarity for negative pairs may be unattainable, and in some cases, such enforcement could detrimentally impact performance. To address this challenge, we propose using multiple projection heads, each producing a distinct set of features. Our pre-training loss function emerges from a solution to the maximum likelihood estimation over head-wise posterior distributions of positive samples given observations. This loss incorporates the similarity measure over positive and negative pairs, each re-weighted by an individual adaptive temperature, regulated to prevent ill solutions. Our approach, Adaptive Multi-Head Contrastive Learning (AMCL), can be applied to and experimentally enhances several popular contrastive learning methods such as SimCLR, MoCo, and Barlow Twins. The improvement remains consistent across various backbones and linear probing epochs, and becomes more significant when employing multiple augmentation methods.</description>

      <title>Open-CRB: Towards Open World Active Learning for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection has recently seen significant advancements through active learning (AL), attaining satisfactory performance by training on a small fraction of strategically selected point clouds. However, in real-world deployments where streaming point clouds may include unknown or novel objects, the ability of current AL methods to capture such objects remains unexplored. This paper investigates a more practical and challenging research task: Open World Active Learning for 3D Object Detection (OWAL-3D), aimed at acquiring informative point clouds with new concepts. To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy called Open Label Conciseness (OLC), which mines novel 3D objects with minimal annotation costs. Our empirical results show that OLC successfully adapts the 3D detection model to the open world scenario with just a single round of selection. Any generic AL policy can then be integrated with the proposed OLC to efficiently address the OWAL-3D problem. Based on this, we introduce the Open-CRB framework, which seamlessly integrates OLC with our preliminary AL method, CRB, designed specifically for 3D object detection. We develop a comprehensive codebase for easy reproducing and future research, supporting 15 baseline methods (\textit{i.e.}, active learning, out-of-distribution detection and open world detection), 2 types of modern 3D detectors (\textit{i.e.}, one-stage SECOND and two-stage PV-RCNN) and 3 benchmark 3D datasets (\textit{i.e.}, KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo). Extensive experiments evidence that the proposed Open-CRB demonstrates superiority and flexibility in recognizing both novel and known classes with very limited labeling costs, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>A Security Risk Taxonomy for Prompt-Based Interaction With Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) permeate more and more applications, an assessment of their associated security risks becomes increasingly necessary. The potential for exploitation by malicious actors, ranging from disinformation to data breaches and reputation damage, is substantial. This paper addresses a gap in current research by specifically focusing on security risks posed by LLMs within the prompt-based interaction scheme, which extends beyond the widely covered ethical and societal implications. Our work proposes a taxonomy of security risks along the user-model communication pipeline and categorizes the attacks by target and attack type alongside the commonly used confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad. The taxonomy is reinforced with specific attack examples to showcase the real-world impact of these risks. Through this taxonomy, we aim to inform the development of robust and secure LLM applications, enhancing their safety and trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>Fair Enough? A map of the current limitations of the requirements to have fair algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12435v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the increase in the usage and efficiency of Artificial Intelligence and, more in general, of Automated Decision-Making systems has brought with it an increasing and welcome awareness of the risks associated with such systems. One of such risks is that of perpetuating or even amplifying bias and unjust disparities present in the data from which many of these systems learn to adjust and optimise their decisions. This awareness has on the one hand encouraged several scientific communities to come up with more and more appropriate ways and methods to assess, quantify, and possibly mitigate such biases and disparities. On the other hand, it has prompted more and more layers of society, including policy makers, to call for fair algorithms. We believe that while many excellent and multidisciplinary research is currently being conducted, what is still fundamentally missing is the awareness that having fair algorithms is per se a nearly meaningless requirement that needs to be complemented with many additional social choices to become actionable. Namely, there is a hiatus between what the society is demanding from Automated Decision-Making systems, and what this demand actually means in real-world scenarios. In this work, we outline the key features of such a hiatus and pinpoint a set of crucial open points that we as a society must address in order to give a concrete meaning to the increasing demand of fairness in Automated Decision-Making systems.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates for Stochastic Approximation: Biased Noise with Unbounded Variance, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02828v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the convergence properties of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method for finding a stationary point of a given objective function $J(\cdot)$. The objective function is not required to be convex. Rather, our results apply to a class of ``invex'' functions, which have the property that every stationary point is also a global minimizer. First, it is assumed that $J(\cdot)$ satisfies a property that is slightly weaker than the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition, denoted here as (KL'). It is shown that the iterations $J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$ converge almost surely to the global minimum of $J(\cdot)$. Next, the hypothesis on $J(\cdot)$ is strengthened from (KL') to the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. With this stronger hypothesis, we derive estimates on the rate of convergence of $J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$ to its limit. Using these results, we show that for functions satisfying the PL property, the convergence rate of both the objective function and the norm of the gradient with SGD is the same as the best-possible rate for convex functions. While some results along these lines have been published in the past, our contributions contain two distinct improvements. First, the assumptions on the stochastic gradient are more general than elsewhere, and second, our convergence is almost sure, and not in expectation. We also study SGD when only function evaluations are permitted. In this setting, we determine the ``optimal'' increments or the size of the perturbations. Using the same set of ideas, we establish the global convergence of the Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithm under more general assumptions on the measurement error, compared to the existing literature. We also derive bounds on the rate of convergence of the SA algorithm under appropriate assumptions.</description>

      <title>Diffence: Fencing Membership Privacy With Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models, while achieving remarkable performances, are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Although various defenses have been proposed, there is still substantial room for improvement in the privacy-utility trade-off. In this work, we introduce a novel defense framework against MIAs by leveraging generative models. The key intuition of our defense is to remove the differences between member and non-member inputs, which is exploited by MIAs, by re-generating input samples before feeding them to the target model. Therefore, our defense, called DIFFENCE, works pre inference, which is unlike prior defenses that are either training-time or post-inference time.
  A unique feature of DIFFENCE is that it works on input samples only, without modifying the training or inference phase of the target model. Therefore, it can be cascaded with other defense mechanisms as we demonstrate through experiments. DIFFENCE is designed to preserve the model's prediction labels for each sample, thereby not affecting accuracy. Furthermore, we have empirically demonstrated it does not reduce the usefulness of confidence vectors. Through extensive experimentation, we show that DIFFENCE can serve as a robust plug-n-play defense mechanism, enhancing membership privacy without compromising model utility. For instance, DIFFENCE reduces MIA accuracy against an undefended model by 15.8\% and attack AUC by 14.0\% on average across three datasets, all without impacting model utility. By integrating DIFFENCE with prior defenses, we can achieve new state-of-the-art performances in the privacy-utility trade-off. For example, when combined with the state-of-the-art SELENA defense it reduces attack accuracy by 9.3\%, and attack AUC by 10.0\%. DIFFENCE achieves this by imposing a negligible computation overhead, adding only 57ms to the inference time per sample processed on average.</description>

      <title>3D Hand Pose Estimation in Everyday Egocentric Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation in everyday egocentric images is challenging for several reasons: poor visual signal (occlusion from the object of interaction, low resolution &amp; motion blur), large perspective distortion (hands are close to the camera), and lack of 3D annotations outside of controlled settings. While existing methods often use hand crops as input to focus on fine-grained visual information to deal with poor visual signal, the challenges arising from perspective distortion and lack of 3D annotations in the wild have not been systematically studied. We focus on this gap and explore the impact of different practices, i.e. crops as input, incorporating camera information, auxiliary supervision, scaling up datasets. We provide several insights that are applicable to both convolutional and transformer models leading to better performance. Based on our findings, we also present WildHands, a system for 3D hand pose estimation in everyday egocentric images. Zero-shot evaluation on 4 diverse datasets (H2O, AssemblyHands, Epic-Kitchens, Ego-Exo4D) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across 2D and 3D metrics, where we beat past methods by 7.4% - 66%. In system level comparisons, WildHands achieves the best 3D hand pose on ARCTIC egocentric split, outperforms FrankMocap across all metrics and HaMeR on 3 out of 6 metrics while being 10x smaller and trained on 5x less data.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Perspective Distortion-induced Shape Ambiguity in Image Crops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objects undergo varying amounts of perspective distortion as they move across a camera's field of view. Models for predicting 3D from a single image often work with crops around the object of interest and ignore the location of the object in the camera's field of view. We note that ignoring this location information further exaggerates the inherent ambiguity in making 3D inferences from 2D images and can prevent models from even fitting to the training data. To mitigate this ambiguity, we propose Intrinsics-Aware Positional Encoding (KPE), which incorporates information about the location of crops in the image and camera intrinsics. Experiments on three popular 3D-from-a-single-image benchmarks: depth prediction on NYU, 3D object detection on KITTI &amp; nuScenes, and predicting 3D shapes of articulated objects on ARCTIC, show the benefits of KPE.</description>

      <title>Connectivity Oracles for Predictable Vertex Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of designing connectivity oracles supporting vertex failures is one of the basic data structures problems for undirected graphs. It is already well understood: previous works [Duan--Pettie STOC'10; Long--Saranurak FOCS'22] achieve query time linear in the number of failed vertices, and it is conditionally optimal as long as we require preprocessing time polynomial in the size of the graph and update time polynomial in the number of failed vertices.
  We revisit this problem in the paradigm of algorithms with predictions: we ask if the query time can be improved if the set of failed vertices can be predicted beforehand up to a small number of errors. More specifically, we design a data structure that, given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set of vertices predicted to fail $\widehat{D} \subseteq V$ of size $d=|\widehat{D}|$, preprocesses it in time $\tilde{O}(d|E|)$ and then can receive an update given as the symmetric difference between the predicted and the actual set of failed vertices $\widehat{D} \triangle D = (\widehat{D} \setminus D) \cup (D \setminus \widehat{D})$ of size $\eta = |\widehat{D} \triangle D|$, process it in time $\tilde{O}(\eta^4)$, and after that answer connectivity queries in $G \setminus D$ in time $O(\eta)$. Viewed from another perspective, our data structure provides an improvement over the state of the art for the \emph{fully dynamic subgraph connectivity problem} in the \emph{sensitivity setting} [Henzinger--Neumann ESA'16].
  We argue that the preprocessing time and query time of our data structure are conditionally optimal under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions.</description>

      <title>Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00003v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metamaterials with functional responses, such as wave-based responses or deformation-induced property variation under external stimuli, can exhibit varying properties or functionalities under different conditions. Herein, we aim at rapid inverse design of these metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors. This inverse problem is challenging due to its intractability and the existence of non-unique solutions. Past works mainly focus on deep-learning-based methods that are data-demanding, require time-consuming training and hyperparameter tuning, and are non-interpretable. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Random-forest-based Interpretable Generative Inverse Design (RIGID), an iteration-free, single-shot inverse design method to achieve the fast generation of metamaterial designs with on-demand functional behaviors. Unlike most existing methods, by exploiting the interpretability of the random forest, we eliminate the need to train an inverse model mapping responses to designs. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained forward model, one can sample design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The RIGID method therefore functions as a generative model that captures the conditional distribution of satisfying solutions given a design target. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RIGID on both acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems where only small datasets (less than 250 training samples) are available. Synthetic design problems are created to further illustrate and validate the mechanism of likelihood estimation in RIGID. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable machine learning into generative design and eliminating its large data requirement.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Empirical Advances in Forest Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decades after their inception, regression forests continue to provide state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming in this respect alternative machine learning models such as regression trees or even neural networks. However, being an ensemble method, the one aspect where regression forests tend to severely underperform regression trees is interpretability. In the present work, we revisit forest pruning, an approach that aims to have the best of both worlds: the accuracy of regression forests and the interpretability of regression trees. This pursuit, whose foundation lies at the core of random forest theory, has seen vast success in empirical studies. In this paper, we contribute theoretical results that support and qualify those empirical findings; namely, we prove the asymptotic advantage of a Lasso-pruned forest over its unpruned counterpart under extremely weak assumptions, as well as high-probability finite-sample generalization bounds for regression forests pruned according to the main methods, which we then validate by way of simulation. Then, we test the accuracy of pruned regression forests against their unpruned counterparts on 19 different datasets (16 synthetic, 3 real). We find that in the vast majority of scenarios tested, there is at least one forest-pruning method that yields equal or better accuracy than the original full forest (in expectation), while just using a small fraction of the trees. We show that, in some cases, the reduction in the size of the forest is so dramatic that the resulting sub-forest can be meaningfully merged into a single tree, obtaining a level of interpretability that is qualitatively superior to that of the original regression forest, which remains a black box.</description>

      <title>SiT: Exploring Flow and Diffusion-based Generative Models with Scalable Interpolant Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). The interpolant framework, which allows for connecting two distributions in a more flexible way than standard diffusion models, makes possible a modular study of various design choices impacting generative models built on dynamical transport: learning in discrete or continuous time, the objective function, the interpolant that connects the distributions, and deterministic or stochastic sampling. By carefully introducing the above ingredients, SiT surpasses DiT uniformly across model sizes on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmark using the exact same model structure, number of parameters, and GFLOPs. By exploring various diffusion coefficients, which can be tuned separately from learning, SiT achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 and 2.62, respectively.</description>

      <title>Generating Likely Counterfactuals Using Sum-Product Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainability of decisions made by AI systems is driven by both recent regulation and user demand. These decisions are often explainable only \emph{post hoc}, after the fact. In counterfactual explanations, one may ask what constitutes the best counterfactual explanation. Clearly, multiple criteria must be taken into account, although "distance from the sample" is a key criterion. Recent methods that consider the plausibility of a counterfactual seem to sacrifice this original objective. Here, we present a system that provides high-likelihood explanations that are, at the same time, close and sparse. We show that the search for the most likely explanations satisfying many common desiderata for counterfactual explanations can be modeled using mixed-integer optimization (MIO). In the process, we propose an MIO formulation of a Sum-Product Network (SPN) and use the SPN to estimate the likelihood of a counterfactual, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Request: Harnessing HTTP Response Headers for Cross-Browser Web Tracker Classification in an Imbalanced Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The World Wide Web's connectivity is greatly attributed to the HTTP protocol, with HTTP messages offering informative header fields that appeal to disciplines like web security and privacy, especially concerning web tracking. Despite existing research employing HTTP request messages to identify web trackers, HTTP response headers are often overlooked. This study endeavors to design effective machine learning classifiers for web tracker detection using binarized HTTP response headers. Data from the Chrome, Firefox, and Brave browsers, obtained through the traffic monitoring browser extension T.EX, serves as our dataset. Ten supervised models were trained on Chrome data and tested across all browsers, including a Chrome dataset from a year later. The results demonstrated high accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and minimal log-loss error for Chrome and Firefox, but subpar performance on Brave, potentially due to its distinct data distribution and feature set. The research suggests that these classifiers are viable for web tracker detection. However, real-world application testing remains pending, and the distinction between tracker types and broader label sources could be explored in future studies.</description>

Abstract: Clifford algebras are a natural generalization of the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions. So far, solely Clifford algebras of the form $Cl_{p,q}$ (i.e., algebras without nilpotent base vectors) have been studied in the context of knowledge graph embeddings. We propose to consider nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two. In these spaces, denoted $Cl_{p,q,r}$, allows generalizing over approaches based on dual numbers (which cannot be modelled using $Cl_{p,q}$) and capturing patterns that emanate from the absence of higher-order interactions between real and complex parts of entity embeddings. We design two new models for the discovery of the parameters $p$, $q$, and $r$. The first model uses a greedy search to optimize $p$, $q$, and $r$. The second predicts $(p, q,r)$ based on an embedding of the input knowledge graph computed using neural networks. The results of our evaluation on seven benchmark datasets suggest that nilpotent vectors can help capture embeddings better. Our comparison against the state of the art suggests that our approach generalizes better than other approaches on all datasets w.r.t. the MRR it achieves on validation data. We also show that a greedy search suffices to discover values of $p$, $q$ and $r$ that are close to optimal.</description>

      <title>Learning Contrastive Feature Representations for Facial Action Unit Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Facial action unit (AU) detection has long encountered the challenge of detecting subtle feature differences when AUs activate. Existing methods often rely on encoding pixel-level information of AUs, which not only encodes additional redundant information but also leads to increased model complexity and limited generalizability. Additionally, the accuracy of AU detection is negatively impacted by the class imbalance issue of each AU type, and the presence of noisy and false AU labels. In this paper, we introduce a novel contrastive learning framework aimed for AU detection that incorporates both self-supervised and supervised signals, thereby enhancing the learning of discriminative features for accurate AU detection. To tackle the class imbalance issue, we employ a negative sample re-weighting strategy that adjusts the step size of updating parameters for minority and majority class samples. Moreover, to address the challenges posed by noisy and false AU labels, we employ a sampling technique that encompasses three distinct types of positive sample pairs. This enables us to inject self-supervised signals into the supervised signal, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of noisy labels. Our experimental assessments, conducted on four widely-utilized benchmark datasets (BP4D, DISFA, GFT and Aff-Wild2), underscore the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods of AU detection.

      <title>ForestColl: Efficient Collective Communications on Heterogeneous Network Fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As modern DNN models grow ever larger, collective communications between the accelerators (allreduce, etc.) emerge as a significant performance bottleneck. Designing efficient communication schedules is challenging, given today's highly diverse and heterogeneous network fabrics. In this paper, we present ForestColl, a tool that generates performant schedules for any network topology. ForestColl constructs broadcast/aggregation spanning trees as the communication schedule, achieving theoretically optimal throughput. Its schedule generation runs in strongly polynomial time and is highly scalable. ForestColl supports any network fabric, including both switching fabrics and direct connections. We evaluated ForestColl on multi-box AMD MI250 and NVIDIA DGX A100 platforms. ForestColl's schedules delivered up to 130% higher performance compared to the vendors' own optimized communication libraries, RCCL and NCCL, and achieved a 20% speedup in LLM training. ForestColl also outperforms other state-of-the-art schedule generation techniques with both up to 61% more efficient generated schedules and orders of magnitude faster schedule generation speed.</description>

      <title>Automated Security Response through Online Learning with Adaptive Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty and misconception about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design Conjectural Online Learning (COL), a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present COL through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations show that COL produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that COL enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Stop Reasoning! When Multimodal LLM with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Meets Adversarial Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) with a great ability of text and image understanding have received great attention. To achieve better reasoning with MLLMs, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely explored, which further promotes MLLMs' explainability by giving intermediate reasoning steps. Despite the strong power demonstrated by MLLMs in multimodal reasoning, recent studies show that MLLMs still suffer from adversarial images. This raises the following open questions: Does CoT also enhance the adversarial robustness of MLLMs? What do the intermediate reasoning steps of CoT entail under adversarial attacks? To answer these questions, we first generalize existing attacks to CoT-based inferences by attacking the two main components, i.e., rationale and answer. We find that CoT indeed improves MLLMs' adversarial robustness against the existing attack methods by leveraging the multi-step reasoning process, but not substantially. Based on our findings, we further propose a novel attack method, termed as stop-reasoning attack, that attacks the model while bypassing the CoT reasoning process. Experiments on three MLLMs and two visual reasoning datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. We show that stop-reasoning attack can result in misled predictions and outperform baseline attacks by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks and Privacy in Topic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research shows that large language models are susceptible to privacy attacks that infer aspects of the training data. However, it is unclear if simpler generative models, like topic models, share similar vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose an attack against topic models that can confidently identify members of the training data in Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Our results suggest that the privacy risks associated with generative modeling are not restricted to large neural models. Additionally, to mitigate these vulnerabilities, we explore differentially private (DP) topic modeling. We propose a framework for private topic modeling that incorporates DP vocabulary selection as a pre-processing step, and show that it improves privacy while having limited effects on practical utility.</description>

      <title>ClaimVer: Explainable Claim-Level Verification and Evidence Attribution of Text Through Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09724v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the midst of widespread misinformation and disinformation through social media and the proliferation of AI-generated texts, it has become increasingly difficult for people to validate and trust information they encounter. Many fact-checking approaches and tools have been developed, but they often lack appropriate explainability or granularity to be useful in various contexts. A text validation method that is easy to use, accessible, and can perform fine-grained evidence attribution has become crucial. More importantly, building user trust in such a method requires presenting the rationale behind each prediction, as research shows this significantly influences people's belief in automated systems. Localizing and bringing users' attention to the specific problematic content is also paramount, instead of providing simple blanket labels. In this paper, we present ClaimVer, a human-centric framework tailored to meet users' informational and verification needs by generating rich annotations and thereby reducing cognitive load. Designed to deliver comprehensive evaluations of texts, it highlights each claim, verifies it against a trusted knowledge graph (KG), presents the evidence, and provides succinct, clear explanations for each claim prediction. Finally, our framework introduces an attribution score, enhancing applicability across a wide range of downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>DreamSampler: Unifying Diffusion Sampling and Score Distillation for Image Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reverse sampling and score-distillation have emerged as main workhorses in recent years for image manipulation using latent diffusion models (LDMs). While reverse diffusion sampling often requires adjustments of LDM architecture or feature engineering, score distillation offers a simple yet powerful model-agnostic approach, but it is often prone to mode-collapsing. To address these limitations and leverage the strengths of both approaches, here we introduce a novel framework called {\em DreamSampler}, which seamlessly integrates these two distinct approaches through the lens of regularized latent optimization. Similar to score-distillation, DreamSampler is a model-agnostic approach applicable to any LDM architecture, but it allows both distillation and reverse sampling with additional guidance for image editing and reconstruction. Through experiments involving image editing, SVG reconstruction and etc, we demonstrate the competitive performance of DreamSampler compared to existing approaches, while providing new applications.

      <title>SugarcaneNet2024: An Optimized Weighted Average Ensemble Approach of LASSO Regularized Pre-trained Models for Sugarcane Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sugarcane, a key crop for the world's sugar industry, is prone to several diseases that have a substantial negative influence on both its yield and quality. To effectively manage and implement preventative initiatives, diseases must be detected promptly and accurately. In this study, we present a unique model called sugarcaneNet2024 that outperforms previous methods for automatically and quickly detecting sugarcane disease through leaf image processing. Our proposed model consolidates an optimized weighted average ensemble of seven customized and LASSO-regularized pre-trained models, particularly InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201, DenseNet169, Xception, and ResNet152V2. Initially, we added three more dense layers with 0.0001 LASSO regularization, three 30% dropout layers, and three batch normalizations with renorm enabled at the bottom of these pre-trained models to improve the performance. The accuracy of sugarcane leaf disease classification was greatly increased by this addition. Following this, several comparative studies between the average ensemble and individual models were carried out, indicating that the ensemble technique performed better. The average ensemble of all modified pre-trained models produced outstanding outcomes: 100%, 99%, 99%, and 99.45% for f1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy, respectively. Performance was further enhanced by the implementation of an optimized weighted average ensemble technique incorporated with grid search. This optimized sugarcaneNet2024 model performed the best for detecting sugarcane diseases, having achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 99.67%, 100%, 100%, and 100% , respectively.</description>

      <title>Compositional Neural Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Texture plays a vital role in enhancing visual richness in both real photographs and computer-generated imagery. However, the process of editing textures often involves laborious and repetitive manual adjustments of textons, which are the recurring local patterns that characterize textures. This work introduces a fully unsupervised approach for representing textures using a compositional neural model that captures individual textons. We represent each texton as a 2D Gaussian function whose spatial support approximates its shape, and an associated feature that encodes its detailed appearance. By modeling a texture as a discrete composition of Gaussian textons, the representation offers both expressiveness and ease of editing. Textures can be edited by modifying the compositional Gaussians within the latent space, and new textures can be efficiently synthesized by feeding the modified Gaussians through a generator network in a feed-forward manner. This approach enables a wide range of applications, including transferring appearance from an image texture to another image, diversifying textures,texture interpolation, revealing/modifying texture variations, edit propagation, texture animation, and direct texton manipulation. The proposed approach contributes to advancing texture analysis, modeling, and editing techniques, and opens up new possibilities for creating visually appealing images with controllable textures.</description>

      <title>ViViDex: Learning Vision-based Dexterous Manipulation from Human Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to learn a unified vision-based policy for multi-fingered robot hands to manipulate a variety of objects in diverse poses. Though prior work has shown benefits of using human videos for policy learning, performance gains have been limited by the noise in estimated trajectories. Moreover, reliance on privileged object information such as ground-truth object states further limits the applicability in realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework ViViDex to improve vision-based policy learning from human videos. It first uses reinforcement learning with trajectory guided rewards to train state-based policies for each video, obtaining both visually natural and physically plausible trajectories from the video. We then rollout successful episodes from state-based policies and train a unified visual policy without using any privileged information. We propose coordinate transformation to further enhance the visual point cloud representation, and compare behavior cloning and diffusion policy for the visual policy training. Experiments both in simulation and on the real robot demonstrate that ViViDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on three dexterous manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image restoration, or inverse problems in image processing, has long been an extensively studied topic. In recent years supervised learning approaches have become a popular strategy attempting to tackle this task. Unfortunately, most supervised learning-based methods are highly demanding in terms of computational resources and training data (sample complexity). In addition, trained models are sensitive to domain changes, such as varying acquisition systems, signal sampling rates, resolution and contrast. In this work, we try to answer a fundamental question: Can supervised learning models generalize well solely by learning from one image or even part of an image? If so, then what is the minimal amount of patches required to achieve acceptable generalization? To this end, we focus on an efficient patch-based learning framework that requires a single image input-output pair for training. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach for supervised image deblurring and super-resolution. Our results showcase significant improvement of learning models' sample efficiency, generalization and time complexity, that can hopefully be leveraged for future real-time applications, and applied to other signals and modalities.</description>

      <title>Exploring Public Attention in the Circular Economy through Topic Modelling with Twin Hyperparameter Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To advance the circular economy (CE), it is crucial to gain insights into the evolution of public attention, cognitive pathways of the masses concerning circular products, and to identify primary concerns. To achieve this, we collected data from diverse platforms, including Twitter, Reddit, and The Guardian, and utilised three topic models to analyse the data. Given the performance of topic modelling may vary depending on hyperparameter settings, this research proposed a novel framework that integrates twin (single and multi-objective) hyperparameter optimisation for the CE. We conducted systematic experiments to ensure that topic models are set with appropriate hyperparameters under different constraints, providing valuable insights into the correlations between CE and public attention. In summary, our optimised model reveals that public remains concerned about the economic impacts of sustainability and circular practices, particularly regarding recyclable materials and environmentally sustainable technologies. The analysis shows that the CE has attracted significant attention on The Guardian, especially in topics related to sustainable development and environmental protection technologies, while discussions are comparatively less active on Twitter. These insights highlight the need for policymakers to implement targeted education programs, create incentives for businesses to adopt CE principles, and enforce more stringent waste management policies alongside improved recycling processes.</description>

      <title>WisPerMed at BioLaySumm: Adapting Autoregressive Large Language Models for Lay Summarization of Scientific Articles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper details the efforts of the WisPerMed team in the BioLaySumm2024 Shared Task on automatic lay summarization in the biomedical domain, aimed at making scientific publications accessible to non-specialists. Large language models (LLMs), specifically the BioMistral and Llama3 models, were fine-tuned and employed to create lay summaries from complex scientific texts. The summarization performance was enhanced through various approaches, including instruction tuning, few-shot learning, and prompt variations tailored to incorporate specific context information. The experiments demonstrated that fine-tuning generally led to the best performance across most evaluated metrics. Few-shot learning notably improved the models' ability to generate relevant and factually accurate texts, particularly when using a well-crafted prompt. Additionally, a Dynamic Expert Selection (DES) mechanism to optimize the selection of text outputs based on readability and factuality metrics was developed. Out of 54 participants, the WisPerMed team reached the 4th place, measured by readability, factuality, and relevance. Determined by the overall score, our approach improved upon the baseline by approx. 5.5 percentage points and was only approx 1.5 percentage points behind the first place.</description>

      <title>Length Optimization in Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional validity and length efficiency are two crucial aspects of conformal prediction (CP). Achieving conditional validity ensures accurate uncertainty quantification for data subpopulations, while proper length efficiency ensures that the prediction sets remain informative and non-trivial. Despite significant efforts to address each of these issues individually, a principled framework that reconciles these two objectives has been missing in the CP literature. In this paper, we develop Conformal Prediction with Length-Optimization (CPL) - a novel framework that constructs prediction sets with (near-) optimal length while ensuring conditional validity under various classes of covariate shifts, including the key cases of marginal and group-conditional coverage. In the infinite sample regime, we provide strong duality results which indicate that CPL achieves conditional validity and length optimality. In the finite sample regime, we show that CPL constructs conditionally valid prediction sets. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior prediction set size performance of CPL compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse real-world and synthetic datasets in classification, regression, and large language model-based multiple choice question answering.</description>

      <title>Human-Agent Joint Learning for Efficient Robot Manipulation Skill Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing a teleoperation system for gathering demonstrations offers the potential for more efficient learning of robot manipulation. However, teleoperating a robot arm equipped with a dexterous hand or gripper, via a teleoperation system presents inherent challenges due to the task's high dimensionality, complexity of motion, and differences between physiological structures. In this study, we introduce a novel system for joint learning between human operators and robots, that enables human operators to share control of a robot end-effector with a learned assistive agent, simplifies the data collection process, and facilitates simultaneous human demonstration collection and robot manipulation training. As data accumulates, the assistive agent gradually learns. Consequently, less human effort and attention are required, enhancing the efficiency of the data collection process. It also allows the human operator to adjust the control ratio to achieve a trade-off between manual and automated control. We conducted experiments in both simulated environments and physical real-world settings. Through user studies and quantitative evaluations, it is evident that the proposed system could enhance data collection efficiency and reduce the need for human adaptation while ensuring the collected data is of sufficient quality for downstream tasks. \textit{For more details, please refer to our webpage https://norweig1an.github.io/HAJL.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the rules underlying organismal development is a major unsolved problem in biology. Each cell in a developing organism responds to signals in its local environment by dividing, excreting, consuming, or reorganizing, yet how these individual actions coordinate over a macroscopic number of cells to grow complex structures with exquisite functionality is unknown. Here we use recent advances in automatic differentiation to discover local interaction rules and genetic networks that yield emergent, systems-level characteristics in a model of development. We consider a growing tissue with cellular interactions mediated by morphogen diffusion, differential cell adhesion and mechanical stress. Each cell has an internal genetic network that is used to make decisions based on the cell's local environment. We show that one can simultaneously learn parameters governing the cell interactions and the genetic network for complex developmental scenarios, including the symmetry breaking of an embryo from an initial cell by creation of emergent chemical gradients, homogenization of growth via mechanical stress, programmed growth into a pre-specified shape, and the ability to repair from damage. When combined with recent experimental advances measuring spatio-temporal dynamics and gene expression of cells in a growing tissue, the methodology outlined here offers a promising path to unravelling the cellular bases of development.</description>

      <title>Improved Robustness and Hyperparameter Selection in the Dense Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08742v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dense Associative Memory generalizes the Hopfield network by allowing for sharper interaction functions. This increases the capacity of the network as an autoassociative memory as nearby learned attractors will not interfere with one another. However, the implementation of the network relies on applying large exponents to the dot product of memory vectors and probe vectors. If the dimension of the data is large the calculation can be very large and result in imprecisions and overflow when using floating point numbers in a practical implementation. We describe the computational issues in detail, modify the original network description to mitigate the problem, and show the modification will not alter the networks' dynamics during update or training. We also show our modification greatly improves hyperparameter selection for the Dense Associative Memory, removing dependence on the interaction vertex and resulting in an optimal region of hyperparameters that does not significantly change with the interaction vertex as it does in the original network.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are having transformative impacts across a wide range of scientific fields, particularly in the biomedical sciences. Just as the goal of Natural Language Processing is to understand sequences of words, a major objective in biology is to understand biological sequences. Genomic Language Models (gLMs), which are LLMs trained on DNA sequences, have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of genomes and how DNA elements at various scales interact to give rise to complex functions. To showcase this potential, we highlight key applications of gLMs, including functional constraint prediction, sequence design, and transfer learning. Despite notable recent progress, however, developing effective and efficient gLMs presents numerous challenges, especially for species with large, complex genomes. Here, we discuss major considerations for developing and evaluating gLMs.</description>

      <title>CIC: Circular Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) is currently the cutting-edge method. However, the inherent difference between testing and training images of LIC results in performance degradation to some extent. Especially for out-of-sample, out-of-distribution, or out-of-domain testing images, the performance of LIC dramatically degraded. Classical LIC is a serial image compression (SIC) approach that utilizes an open-loop architecture with serial encoding and decoding units. Nevertheless, according to the theory of automatic control, a closed-loop architecture holds the potential to improve the dynamic and static performance of LIC. Therefore, a circular image compression (CIC) approach with closed-loop encoding and decoding elements is proposed to minimize the gap between testing and training images and upgrade the capability of LIC. The proposed CIC establishes a nonlinear loop equation and proves that steady-state error between reconstructed and original images is close to zero by Taylor series expansion. The proposed CIC method possesses the property of Post-Training and plug-and-play which can be built on any existing advanced SIC methods. Experimental results on five public image compression datasets demonstrate that the proposed CIC outperforms five competing state-of-the-art open-source SIC algorithms in reconstruction capacity. Experimental results further show that the proposed method is suitable for out-of-sample testing images with dark backgrounds, sharp edges, high contrast, grid shapes, or complex patterns.</description>

      <title>Low dimensional representation of multi-patient flow cytometry datasets using optimal transport for minimal residual disease detection in leukemia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representing and quantifying Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, is essential in the prognosis and follow-up of AML patients. As traditional cytological analysis cannot detect leukemia cells below 5\%, the analysis of flow cytometry dataset is expected to provide more reliable results. In this paper, we explore statistical learning methods based on optimal transport (OT) to achieve a relevant low-dimensional representation of multi-patient flow cytometry measurements (FCM) datasets considered as high-dimensional probability distributions. Using the framework of OT, we justify the use of the K-means algorithm for dimensionality reduction of multiple large-scale point clouds through mean measure quantization by merging all the data into a single point cloud. After this quantization step, the visualization of the intra and inter-patients FCM variability is carried out by embedding low-dimensional quantized probability measures into a linear space using either Wasserstein Principal Component Analysis (PCA) through linearized OT or log-ratio PCA of compositional data. Using a publicly available FCM dataset and a FCM dataset from Bordeaux University Hospital, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the popular kernel mean embedding technique for statistical learning from multiple high-dimensional probability distributions. We also highlight the usefulness of our methodology for low-dimensional projection and clustering patient measurements according to their level of MRD in AML from FCM. In particular, our OT-based approach allows a relevant and informative two-dimensional representation of the results of the FlowSom algorithm, a state-of-the-art method for the detection of MRD in AML using multi-patient FCM.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a wide array of machine learning algorithms are specific instances of one single paradigm: reciprocal learning. These instances range from active learning over multi-armed bandits to self-training. We show that all these algorithms do not only learn parameters from data but also vice versa: They iteratively alter training data in a way that depends on the current model fit. We introduce reciprocal learning as a generalization of these algorithms using the language of decision theory. This allows us to study under what conditions they converge. The key is to guarantee that reciprocal learning contracts such that the Banach fixed-point theorem applies. In this way, we find that reciprocal learning algorithms converge at linear rates to an approximately optimal model under relatively mild assumptions on the loss function, if their predictions are probabilistic and the sample adaption is both non-greedy and either randomized or regularized. We interpret these findings and provide corollaries that relate them to specific active learning, self-training, and bandit algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Visual Question Answering through Ranking-Based Hybrid Training and Multimodal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires systems to provide accurate answers to questions based on image content. Current VQA models struggle with complex questions due to limitations in capturing and integrating multimodal information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Rank VQA model, which leverages a ranking-inspired hybrid training strategy to enhance VQA performance. The Rank VQA model integrates high-quality visual features extracted using the Faster R-CNN model and rich semantic text features obtained from a pre-trained BERT model. These features are fused through a sophisticated multimodal fusion technique employing multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Additionally, a ranking learning module is incorporated to optimize the relative ranking of answers, thus improving answer accuracy. The hybrid training strategy combines classification and ranking losses, enhancing the model's generalization ability and robustness across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Rank VQA model. Our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on standard VQA datasets, including VQA v2.0 and COCO-QA, in terms of both accuracy and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The superior performance of Rank VQA is evident in its ability to handle complex questions that require understanding nuanced details and making sophisticated inferences from the image and text. This work highlights the effectiveness of a ranking-based hybrid training strategy in improving VQA performance and lays the groundwork for further research in multimodal learning methods.</description>

      <title>Underwater SONAR Image Classification and Analysis using LIME-based Explainable Artificial Intelligence</title>

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have revolutionized image classification by mimicking human cognition and automating complex decision-making processes. However, the deployment of AI systems in the wild, especially in high-security domains such as defence, is curbed by the lack of explainability of the model. To this end, eXplainable AI (XAI) is an emerging area of research that is intended to explore the unexplained hidden black box nature of deep neural networks. This paper explores the application of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tool to interpret the underwater image classification results, one of the first works in the domain to the best of our knowledge. Our study delves into the realm of SONAR image classification using a custom dataset derived from diverse sources, including the Seabed Objects KLSG dataset, the camera SONAR dataset, the mine SONAR images dataset, and the SCTD dataset. An extensive analysis of transfer learning techniques for image classification using benchmark Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, etc. is carried out. On top of this classification model, a post-hoc XAI technique, viz. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are incorporated to provide transparent justifications for the model's decisions by perturbing input data locally to see how predictions change. Furthermore, Submodular Picks LIME (SP-LIME) a version of LIME particular to images, that perturbs the image based on the submodular picks is also extensively studied. To this end, two submodular optimization algorithms i.e. Quickshift and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) are leveraged towards submodular picks. The extensive analysis of XAI techniques highlights interpretability of the results in a more human-compliant way, thus boosting our confidence and reliability.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multiple Strategies to Improve Multilingual Coreference Resolution in CorefUD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coreference resolution, the task of identifying expressions in text that refer to the same entity, is a critical component in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. This paper presents our end-to-end neural coreference resolution system, utilizing the CorefUD 1.1 dataset, which spans 17 datasets across 12 languages. Our model is based on the end-to-end neural coreference resolution system. We first establish strong baseline models, including monolingual and cross-lingual variations, and then propose several extensions to enhance performance across diverse linguistic contexts. These extensions include cross-lingual training, incorporation of syntactic information, a Span2Head model for optimized headword prediction, and advanced singleton modeling. We also experiment with headword span representation and long-document modeling through overlapping segments. The proposed extensions, particularly the heads-only approach, singleton modeling, and long document prediction, significantly improve performance across most datasets. We also perform zero-shot cross-lingual experiments, highlighting the potential and limitations of cross-lingual transfer in coreference resolution. Our findings contribute to the development of robust and scalable coreference systems for multilingual coreference resolution. Finally, we evaluate our model on the CorefUD 1.1 test set and surpass the best model from the CRAC 2023 shared task of comparable size by a large margin. Our model is available on GitHub: https://github.com/ondfa/coref-multiling</description>

      <title>Transfer-based Adversarial Poisoning Attacks for Online (MIMO-)Deep Receviers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the design of wireless receivers using deep neural networks (DNNs), known as deep receivers, has attracted extensive attention for ensuring reliable communication in complex channel environments. To adapt quickly to dynamic channels, online learning has been adopted to update the weights of deep receivers with over-the-air data (e.g., pilots). However, the fragility of neural models and the openness of wireless channels expose these systems to malicious attacks. To this end, understanding these attack methods is essential for robust receiver design. In this paper, we propose a transfer-based adversarial poisoning attack method for online receivers. Without knowledge of the attack target, adversarial perturbations are injected to the pilots, poisoning the online deep receiver and impairing its ability to adapt to dynamic channels and nonlinear effects. In particular, our attack method targets Deep Soft Interference Cancellation (DeepSIC)[1] using online meta-learning. As a classical model-driven deep receiver, DeepSIC incorporates wireless domain knowledge into its architecture. This integration allows it to adapt efficiently to time-varying channels with only a small number of pilots, achieving optimal performance in a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) scenario. The deep receiver in this scenario has a number of applications in the field of wireless communication, which motivates our study of the attack methods targeting it. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack in simulations on synthetic linear, synthetic nonlinear, static, and COST 2100 channels. Simulation results indicate that the proposed poisoning attack significantly reduces the performance of online receivers in rapidly changing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bi-modality Images Transfer with a Discrete Process Matching Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, medical image synthesis gains more and more popularity, along with the rapid development of generative models. Medical image synthesis aims to generate an unacquired image modality, often from other observed data modalities. Synthesized images can be used for clinical diagnostic assistance, data augmentation for model training and validation or image quality improving. In the meanwhile, the flow-based models are among the successful generative models for the ability of generating realistic and high-quality synthetic images. However, most flow-based models require to calculate flow ordinary different equation (ODE) evolution steps in transfer process, for which the performances are significantly limited by heavy computation time due to a large number of time iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel flow-based model, namely Discrete Process Matching (DPM) to accomplish the bi-modality image transfer tasks. Different to other flow matching based models, we propose to utilize both forward and backward ODE flow and enhance the consistency on the intermediate images of few discrete time steps, resulting in a transfer process with much less iteration steps while maintaining high-quality generations for both modalities. Our experiments on three datasets of MRI T1/T2 and CT/MRI demonstrate that DPM outperforms other state-of-the-art flow-based methods for bi-modality image synthesis, achieving higher image quality with less computation time cost.</description>

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a key computing kernel of Transformers, calculating pairwise correlations across the entire input sequence. The computing complexity and frequent memory access in computing self-attention put a huge burden on the system especially when the sequence length increases. This paper presents an analog and digital hybrid processor to accelerate the attention mechanism for transformers in 65nm CMOS technology. We propose an analog computing-in-memory (CIM) core, which prunes ~75% of low-score tokens on average during runtime at ultra-low power and delay. Additionally, a digital processor performs precise computations only for ~25% unpruned tokens selected by the analog CIM core, preventing accuracy degradation. Measured results show peak energy efficiency of 14.8 and 1.65 TOPS/W, and peak area efficiency of 976.6 and 79.4 GOPS/mm$^\mathrm{2}$ in the analog core and the system-on-chip (SoC), respectively.</description>

      <title>Modelling Global Trade with Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06554</link>

Abstract: Global trade is shaped by a complex mix of factors beyond supply and demand, including tangible variables like transport costs and tariffs, as well as less quantifiable influences such as political and economic relations. Traditionally, economists model trade using gravity models, which rely on explicit covariates but often struggle to capture these subtler drivers of trade. In this work, we employ optimal transport and a deep neural network to learn a time-dependent cost function from data, without imposing a specific functional form. This approach consistently outperforms traditional gravity models in accuracy while providing natural uncertainty quantification. Applying our framework to global food and agricultural trade, we show that the global South suffered disproportionately from the war in Ukraine's impact on wheat markets. We also analyze the effects of free-trade agreements and trade disputes with China, as well as Brexit's impact on British trade with Europe, uncovering hidden patterns that trade volumes alone cannot reveal.</description>

      <title>CompressedMediQ: Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Pipeline for High-Dimensional Neuroimaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces CompressedMediQ, a novel hybrid quantum-classical machine learning pipeline specifically developed to address the computational challenges associated with high-dimensional multi-class neuroimaging data analysis. Standard neuroimaging datasets, such as large-scale MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia (NIFD), present significant hurdles due to their vast size and complexity. CompressedMediQ integrates classical high-performance computing (HPC) nodes for advanced MRI pre-processing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-PCA-based feature extraction and reduction, addressing the limited-qubit availability for quantum data encoding in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era. This is followed by Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) classification. By utilizing quantum kernel methods, the pipeline optimizes feature mapping and classification, enhancing data separability and outperforming traditional neuroimaging analysis techniques. Experimental results highlight the pipeline's superior accuracy in dementia staging, validating the practical use of quantum machine learning in clinical diagnostics. Despite the limitations of NISQ devices, this proof-of-concept demonstrates the transformative potential of quantum-enhanced learning, paving the way for scalable and precise diagnostic tools in healthcare and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Context-Conditioned Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning for Reliable V2V Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving reliable multidimensional Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) channel state information (CSI) prediction is both challenging and crucial for optimizing downstream tasks that depend on instantaneous CSI. This work extends traditional prediction approaches by focusing on four-dimensional (4D) CSI, which includes predictions over time, bandwidth, and antenna (TX and RX) space. Such a comprehensive framework is essential for addressing the dynamic nature of mobility environments within intelligent transportation systems, necessitating the capture of both temporal and spatial dependencies across diverse domains. To address this complexity, we propose a novel context-conditioned spatiotemporal predictive learning method. This method leverages causal convolutional long short-term memory (CA-ConvLSTM) to effectively capture dependencies within 4D CSI data, and incorporates context-conditioned attention mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of spatiotemporal memory updates. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive meta-learning scheme tailored for recurrent networks to mitigate the issue of accumulative prediction errors. We validate the proposed method through empirical studies conducted across three different geometric configurations and mobility scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictive models, achieving superior performance across various geometries. Moreover, we show that the meta-learning framework significantly enhances the performance of recurrent-based predictive models in highly challenging cross-geometry settings, thus highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation, utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases, models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI development.</description>

      <title>CritiPrefill: A Segment-wise Criticality-based Approach for Prefilling Acceleration in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved notable success across various domains, yet efficient inference is still limited by the quadratic computation complexity of the attention mechanism. The inference consists of prefilling and decoding phases. Although several attempts have been made to accelerate decoding, the inefficiency of the prefilling phase, especially for long-context tasks, remains a challenge. In this paper, we observe a locality in query criticality during the prefilling phase of long-context processing: adjacent query tokens tend to focus on similar subsets of the past Key-Value (KV) cache. Based on this observation, we propose CritiPrefill, a criticality-based segment-wise prefilling method. This method partitions the input sequence's queries and KV cache into segments and blocks, utilizing a segment-wise algorithm to estimate the query criticality. By pruning non-critical computations between query segments and cache blocks in the self-attention mechanism, the prefilling process can be significantly accelerated. Extensive evaluations on multiple long-context datasets show up to 2.7x speedup on Llama3-8B and 3.0x speedup on Yi-9B for 128K context length on a single A100 GPU, with minimal quality degradation.</description>

      <title>On the Hardness of Decentralized Multi-Agent Policy Evaluation under Byzantine Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a fully-decentralized multi-agent policy evaluation problem, which is an important sub-problem in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, in the presence of up to $f$ faulty agents. In particular, we focus on the so-called Byzantine faulty model with model poisoning setting. In general, policy evaluation is to evaluate the value function of any given policy. In cooperative multi-agent system, the system-wide rewards are usually modeled as the uniform average of rewards from all agents. We investigate the multi-agent policy evaluation problem in the presence of Byzantine agents, particularly in the setting of heterogeneous local rewards. Ideally, the goal of the agents is to evaluate the accumulated system-wide rewards, which are uniform average of rewards of the normal agents for a given policy. It means that all agents agree upon common values (the consensus part) and furthermore, the consensus values are the value functions (the convergence part). However, we prove that this goal is not achievable. Instead, we consider a relaxed version of the problem, where the goal of the agents is to evaluate accumulated system-wide reward, which is an appropriately weighted average reward of the normal agents. We further prove that there is no correct algorithm that can guarantee that the total number of positive weights exceeds $|\mathcal{N}|-f $, where $|\mathcal{N}|$ is the number of normal agents. Towards the end, we propose a Byzantine-tolerant decentralized temporal difference algorithm that can guarantee asymptotic consensus under scalar function approximation. We then empirically test the effective of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>TACO-RL: Task Aware Prompt Compression Optimization with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 in various applications has led to a surge in the size of prompts required for optimal performance, leading to challenges in computational efficiency. Prompt compression aims to reduce the inference cost by minimizing input tokens without compromising on the task performance. However, existing prompt compression techniques either rely on sub-optimal metrics such as information entropy or model it as a task-agnostic token classification problem that fails to capture task-specific information. To address these issues, we propose a novel and efficient reinforcement learning (RL) based task-aware prompt compression method. To ensure low latency requirements, we leverage existing Transformer encoder-based token classification model while guiding the learning process with task-specific reward signals using lightweight REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our method on three diverse and challenging tasks including text summarization, question answering and code summarization. We demonstrate that our RL-guided compression method improves the task performance by 8% - 260% across these three scenarios over state-of-the-art compression techniques while satisfying the same compression rate and latency requirements.</description>
