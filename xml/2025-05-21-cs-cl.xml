      <title>A Data Synthesis Method Driven by Large Language Models for Proactive Mining of Implicit User Intentions in Tourism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the tourism domain, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to mine implicit user intentions from tourists' ambiguous inquiries and lack the capacity to proactively guide users toward clarifying their needs. A critical bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality training datasets that facilitate proactive questioning and implicit intention mining. While recent advances leverage LLM-driven data synthesis to generate such datasets and transfer specialized knowledge to downstream models, existing approaches suffer from several shortcomings: (1) lack of adaptation to the tourism domain, (2) skewed distributions of detail levels in initial inquiries, (3) contextual redundancy in the implicit intention mining module, and (4) lack of explicit thinking about tourists' emotions and intention values. Therefore, we propose SynPT (A Data Synthesis Method Driven by LLMs for Proactive Mining of Implicit User Intentions in the Tourism), which constructs an LLM-driven user agent and assistant agent to simulate dialogues based on seed data collected from Chinese tourism websites. This approach addresses the aforementioned limitations and generates SynPT-Dialog, a training dataset containing explicit reasoning. The dataset is utilized to fine-tune a general LLM, enabling it to proactively mine implicit user intentions. Experimental evaluations, conducted from both human and LLM perspectives, demonstrate the superiority of SynPT compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we analyze key hyperparameters and present case studies to illustrate the practical applicability of our method, including discussions on its adaptability to English-language scenarios. All code and data are publicly available.</description>

      <title>AI-generated Text Detection: A Multifaceted Approach to Binary and Multiclass Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating text that closely resembles human writing across a wide range of styles and genres. However, such capabilities are prone to potential misuse, such as fake news generation, spam email creation, and misuse in academic assignments. As a result, accurate detection of AI-generated text and identification of the model that generated it are crucial for maintaining the responsible use of LLMs. In this work, we addressed two sub-tasks put forward by the Defactify workshop under AI-Generated Text Detection shared task at the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025): Task A involved distinguishing between human-authored or AI-generated text, while Task B focused on attributing text to its originating language model. For each task, we proposed two neural architectures: an optimized model and a simpler variant. For Task A, the optimized neural architecture achieved fifth place with $F1$ score of 0.994, and for Task B, the simpler neural architecture also ranked fifth place with $F1$ score of 0.627.</description>

      <title>Assessing Collective Reasoning in Multi-Agent LLMs via Hidden Profile Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced problem-solving through distributed information integration, but also risk replicating collective reasoning failures observed in human groups. Yet, no theory-grounded benchmark exists to systematically evaluate such failures. In this paper, we introduce the Hidden Profile paradigm from social psychology as a diagnostic testbed for multi-agent LLM systems. By distributing critical information asymmetrically across agents, the paradigm reveals how inter-agent dynamics support or hinder collective reasoning. We first formalize the paradigm for multi-agent decision-making under distributed knowledge and instantiate it as a benchmark with nine tasks spanning diverse scenarios, including adaptations from prior human studies. We then conduct experiments with GPT-4.1 and five other leading LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced variants, showing that multi-agent systems across all models fail to match the accuracy of single agents given complete information. While agents' collective performance is broadly comparable to that of human groups, nuanced behavioral differences emerge, such as increased sensitivity to social desirability. Finally, we demonstrate the paradigm's diagnostic utility by exploring a cooperation-contradiction trade-off in multi-agent LLM systems. We find that while cooperative agents are prone to over-coordination in collective settings, increased contradiction impairs group convergence. This work contributes a reproducible framework for evaluating multi-agent LLM systems and motivates future research on artificial collective intelligence and human-AI interaction.</description>

      <title>Talk to Your Slides: Efficient Slide Editing Agent with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research on large language models (LLMs) for PowerPoint predominantly focuses on slide generation, overlooking the common yet tedious task of editing existing slides. We introduce Talk-to-Your-Slides, an LLM-powered agent that directly edits slides within active PowerPoint sessions through COM communication. Our system employs a two-level approach: (1) high-level processing where an LLM agent interprets instructions and formulates editing plans, and (2) low-level execution where Python scripts directly manipulate PowerPoint objects. Unlike previous methods relying on predefined operations, our approach enables more flexible and contextually-aware editing. To facilitate evaluation, we present TSBench, a human-annotated dataset of 379 diverse editing instructions with corresponding slide variations. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk-to-Your-Slides significantly outperforms baseline methods in execution success rate, instruction fidelity, and editing efficiency. Our code and benchmark are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/talk-to-your-slides/</description>

      <title>MedGUIDE: Benchmarking Clinical Decision-Making in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical guidelines, typically structured as decision trees, are central to evidence-based medical practice and critical for ensuring safe and accurate diagnostic decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can reliably follow such structured protocols. In this work, we introduce MedGUIDE, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on their ability to make guideline-consistent clinical decisions. MedGUIDE is constructed from 55 curated NCCN decision trees across 17 cancer types and uses clinical scenarios generated by LLMs to create a large pool of multiple-choice diagnostic questions. We apply a two-stage quality selection process, combining expert-labeled reward models and LLM-as-a-judge ensembles across ten clinical and linguistic criteria, to select 7,747 high-quality samples. We evaluate 25 LLMs spanning general-purpose, open-source, and medically specialized models, and find that even domain-specific LLMs often underperform on tasks requiring structured guideline adherence. We also test whether performance can be improved via in-context guideline inclusion or continued pretraining. Our findings underscore the importance of MedGUIDE in assessing whether LLMs can operate safely within the procedural frameworks expected in real-world clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Steering Risk Preferences in Large Language Models by Aligning Behavioral and Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing the behavior of large language models (LLMs) can be as straightforward as editing the Transformer's residual streams using appropriately constructed "steering vectors." These modifications to internal neural activations, a form of representation engineering, offer an effective and targeted means of influencing model behavior without retraining or fine-tuning the model. But how can such steering vectors be systematically identified? We propose a principled approach for uncovering steering vectors by aligning latent representations elicited through behavioral methods (specifically, Markov chain Monte Carlo with LLMs) with their neural counterparts. To evaluate this approach, we focus on extracting latent risk preferences from LLMs and steering their risk-related outputs using the aligned representations as steering vectors. We show that the resulting steering vectors successfully and reliably modulate LLM outputs in line with the targeted behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose THELMA (Task Based Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Model Applications), a reference free framework for RAG (Retrieval Augmented generation) based question answering (QA) applications. THELMA consist of six interdependent metrics specifically designed for holistic, fine grained evaluation of RAG QA applications. THELMA framework helps developers and application owners evaluate, monitor and improve end to end RAG QA pipelines without requiring labelled sources or reference responses.We also present our findings on the interplay of the proposed THELMA metrics, which can be interpreted to identify the specific RAG component needing improvement in QA applications.</description>

      <title>Critique-Guided Distillation: Improving Supervised Fine-tuning via Better Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using expert demonstrations often suffer from the imitation problem, where the model learns to reproduce the correct responses without \emph{understanding} the underlying rationale. To address this limitation, we propose \textsc{Critique-Guided Distillation (CGD)}, a novel multi-stage framework that integrates teacher model generated \emph{explanatory critiques} and \emph{refined responses} into the SFT process. A student model is then trained to map the triplet of prompt, teacher critique, and its own initial response to the corresponding refined teacher response, thereby learning both \emph{what} to imitate and \emph{why}. Using entropy-based analysis, we show that \textsc{CGD} reduces refinement uncertainty and can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior update. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of \textsc{CGD}, on variety of benchmark tasks, and demonstrate significant gains on both math (AMC23 +17.5%) and language understanding tasks (MMLU-Pro +6.3%), while successfully mitigating the format drift issues observed in previous critique fine-tuning (CFT) techniques.</description>

      <title>Can an Easy-to-Hard Curriculum Make Reasoning Emerge in Small Language Models? Evidence from a Four-Stage Curriculum on GPT-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a developmentally ordered curriculum markedly improves reasoning transparency and sample-efficiency in small language models (SLMs). Concretely, we train Cognivolve, a 124 M-parameter GPT-2 model, on a four-stage syllabus that ascends from lexical matching to multi-step symbolic inference and then evaluate it without any task-specific fine-tuning. Cognivolve reaches target accuracy in half the optimization steps of a single-phase baseline, activates an order-of-magnitude more gradient-salient reasoning heads, and shifts those heads toward deeper layers, yielding higher-entropy attention that balances local and long-range context. The same curriculum applied out of order or with optimizer resets fails to reproduce these gains, confirming that progression--not extra compute--drives the effect. We also identify open challenges: final-answer success still lags a conventional run by about 30%, and our saliency probe under-detects verbal-knowledge heads in the hardest stage, suggesting directions for mixed-stage fine-tuning and probe expansion.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models: A Survey Across NLP Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, ensuring their effectiveness across multiple languages presents unique challenges. Multilingual prompt engineering has emerged as a key approach to enhance LLMs' capabilities in diverse linguistic settings without requiring extensive parameter re-training or fine-tuning. With growing interest in multilingual prompt engineering over the past two to three years, researchers have explored various strategies to improve LLMs' performance across languages and NLP tasks. By crafting structured natural language prompts, researchers have successfully extracted knowledge from LLMs across different languages, making these techniques an accessible pathway for a broader audience, including those without deep expertise in machine learning, to harness the capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we survey and categorize different multilingual prompting techniques based on the NLP tasks they address across a diverse set of datasets that collectively span around 250 languages. We further highlight the LLMs employed, present a taxonomy of approaches and discuss potential state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods for specific multilingual datasets. Additionally, we derive a range of insights across language families and resource levels (high-resource vs. low-resource), including analyses such as the distribution of NLP tasks by language resource type and the frequency of prompting methods across different language families. Our survey reviews 36 research papers covering 39 prompting techniques applied to 30 multilingual NLP tasks, with the majority of these studies published in the last two years.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity Resolution in Text-to-Structured Data Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods of ambiguity handling either exploit ReACT framework to produce the correct mapping through trial and error, or supervised fine tuning to guide models to produce a biased mapping to improve certain tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes the representation difference of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverage the difference to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect ambiguity of a sentence, we focused on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations and what cause the LLM ignore multiple interpretations. Different to the distance calculated by dense embedding vectors, we utilize the observation that ambiguity is caused by concept missing in latent space of LLM to design a new distance measurement, computed through the path kernel by the integral of gradient values for each concepts from sparse-autoencoder (SAE) under each state. We identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous questions with this measurement. Based on our observation, We propose a new framework to improve the performance of LLMs on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concepts prediction.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Design Decisions for Dual Encoder-based Entity Disambiguation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entity disambiguation (ED) is the task of linking mentions in text to corresponding entries in a knowledge base. Dual Encoders address this by embedding mentions and label candidates in a shared embedding space and applying a similarity metric to predict the correct label. In this work, we focus on evaluating key design decisions for Dual Encoder-based ED, such as its loss function, similarity metric, label verbalization format, and negative sampling strategy. We present the resulting model VerbalizED, a document-level Dual Encoder model that includes contextual label verbalizations and efficient hard negative sampling. Additionally, we explore an iterative prediction variant that aims to improve the disambiguation of challenging data points. Comprehensive experiments on AIDA-Yago validate the effectiveness of our approach, offering insights into impactful design choices that result in a new State-of-the-Art system on the ZELDA benchmark.</description>

      <title>Automatic Speech Recognition for African Low-Resource Languages: Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have transformed human-computer interaction; however, low-resource languages in Africa remain significantly underrepresented in both research and practical applications. This study investigates the major challenges hindering the development of ASR systems for these languages, which include data scarcity, linguistic complexity, limited computational resources, acoustic variability, and ethical concerns surrounding bias and privacy. The primary goal is to critically analyze these barriers and identify practical, inclusive strategies to advance ASR technologies within the African context. Recent advances and case studies emphasize promising strategies such as community-driven data collection, self-supervised and multilingual learning, lightweight model architectures, and techniques that prioritize privacy. Evidence from pilot projects involving various African languages showcases the feasibility and impact of customized solutions, which encompass morpheme-based modeling and domain-specific ASR applications in sectors like healthcare and education. The findings highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to tackle the distinct linguistic and infrastructural challenges faced by the continent. This study offers a progressive roadmap for creating ethical, efficient, and inclusive ASR systems that not only safeguard linguistic diversity but also improve digital accessibility and promote socioeconomic participation for speakers of African languages.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bracketing Encodings for Dependency Parsing as Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a family of encodings for sequence labeling dependency parsing, based on the concept of hierarchical bracketing. We prove that the existing 4-bit projective encoding belongs to this family, but it is suboptimal in the number of labels used to encode a tree. We derive an optimal hierarchical bracketing, which minimizes the number of symbols used and encodes projective trees using only 12 distinct labels (vs. 16 for the 4-bit encoding). We also extend optimal hierarchical bracketing to support arbitrary non-projectivity in a more compact way than previous encodings. Our new encodings yield competitive accuracy on a diverse set of treebanks.</description>

      <title>Disambiguating Reference in Visually Grounded Dialogues through Joint Modeling of Textual and Multimodal Semantic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal reference resolution, including phrase grounding, aims to understand the semantic relations between mentions and real-world objects. Phrase grounding between images and their captions is a well-established task. In contrast, for real-world applications, it is essential to integrate textual and multimodal reference resolution to unravel the reference relations within dialogue, especially in handling ambiguities caused by pronouns and ellipses. This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative models for this task, MDETR and GLIP. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates that incorporating textual reference relations strengthens the confidence scores between mentions, including pronouns and predicates, and objects, which can reduce the ambiguities that arise in visually grounded dialogues.</description>

      <title>MedCaseReasoning: Evaluating and learning diagnostic reasoning from clinical case reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doctors and patients alike increasingly use Large Language Models (LLMs) to diagnose clinical cases. However, unlike domains such as math or coding, where correctness can be objectively defined by the final answer, medical diagnosis requires both the outcome and the reasoning process to be accurate. Currently, widely used medical benchmarks like MedQA and MMLU assess only accuracy in the final answer, overlooking the quality and faithfulness of the clinical reasoning process. To address this limitation, we introduce MedCaseReasoning, the first open-access dataset for evaluating LLMs on their ability to align with clinician-authored diagnostic reasoning. The dataset includes 14,489 diagnostic question-and-answer cases, each paired with detailed reasoning statements derived from open-access medical case reports. We evaluate state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs on MedCaseReasoning and find significant shortcomings in their diagnoses and reasoning: for instance, the top-performing open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 48% 10-shot diagnostic accuracy and mentions only 64% of the clinician reasoning statements (recall). However, we demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on the reasoning traces derived from MedCaseReasoning significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning recall by an average relative gain of 29% and 41%, respectively. The open-source dataset, code, and models are available at https://github.com/kevinwu23/Stanford-MedCaseReasoning.</description>

      <title>ZeroTuning: Unlocking the Initial Token's Power to Enhance Large Language Models Without Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, training-free methods for improving large language models (LLMs) have attracted growing interest, with token-level attention tuning emerging as a promising and interpretable direction. However, existing methods typically rely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific tokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper, we uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial token is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model behavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's attention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent tokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically, we find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more effectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a consistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but varies across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct preferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we propose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by applying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token. Despite tuning only one token, ZeroTuning achieves higher performance on text classification, multiple-choice, and multi-turn conversation tasks across models such as Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek. For example, ZeroTuning improves Llama-3.1-8B by 11.71% on classification, 2.64% on QA tasks, and raises its multi-turn score from 7.804 to 7.966. The method is also robust to limited resources, few-shot settings, long contexts, quantization, decoding strategies, and prompt variations. Our work sheds light on a previously overlooked control point in LLMs, offering new insights into both inference-time tuning and model interpretability.</description>

      <title>Token Masking Improves Transformer-Based Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While transformer-based models achieve strong performance on text classification, we explore whether masking input tokens can further enhance their effectiveness. We propose token masking regularization, a simple yet theoretically motivated method that randomly replaces input tokens with a special [MASK] token at probability p. This introduces stochastic perturbations during training, leading to implicit gradient averaging that encourages the model to capture deeper inter-token dependencies. Experiments on language identification and sentiment analysis -- across diverse models (mBERT, Qwen2.5-0.5B, TinyLlama-1.1B) -- show consistent improvements over standard regularization techniques. We identify task-specific optimal masking rates, with p = 0.1 as a strong general default. We attribute the gains to two key effects: (1) input perturbation reduces overfitting, and (2) gradient-level smoothing acts as implicit ensembling.</description>

      <title>Masking in Multi-hop QA: An Analysis of How Language Models Perform with Context Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) adds layers of complexity to question answering, making it more challenging. When Language Models (LMs) are prompted with multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant information but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information sources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the causal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In this paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting search results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study reveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the ones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in MHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order of gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned decoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order aligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models with bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively boost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough investigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of MHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher values when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to heuristically improve LMs' performance on this task. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hwy9855/MultiHopQA-Reasoning.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Semantics With Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory based on a universal set of semantic primes: simple, primitive word-meanings that have been shown to exist in most, if not all, languages of the world. According to this framework, any word, regardless of complexity, can be paraphrased using these primes, revealing a clear and universally translatable meaning. These paraphrases, known as explications, can offer valuable applications for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but producing them has traditionally been a slow, manual process. In this work, we present the first study of using large language models (LLMs) to generate NSM explications. We introduce automatic evaluation methods, a tailored dataset for training and evaluation, and fine-tuned models for this task. Our 1B and 8B models outperform GPT-4o in producing accurate, cross-translatable explications, marking a significant step toward universal semantic representation with LLMs and opening up new possibilities for applications in semantic analysis, translation, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Retrospex: Language Agent Meets Offline Reinforcement Learning Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and commonsense reasoning capabilities, making them valuable for creating powerful agents. However, existing LLM agent frameworks have not fully utilized past experiences for improvement. This work introduces a new LLM-based agent framework called Retrospex, which addresses this challenge by analyzing past experiences in depth. Unlike previous approaches, Retrospex does not directly integrate experiences into the LLM's context. Instead, it combines the LLM's action likelihood with action values estimated by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Critic, which is trained on past experiences through an offline ''retrospection'' process. Additionally, Retrospex employs a dynamic action rescoring mechanism that increases the importance of experience-based values for tasks that require more interaction with the environment. We evaluate Retrospex in ScienceWorld, ALFWorld and Webshop environments, demonstrating its advantages over strong, contemporary baselines.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Building a Domain-Specific Large Language Model from Scratch: A Case Study of a Classical Chinese Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose large language models demonstrate notable capabilities in language comprehension and generation, achieving results that are comparable to, or even surpass, human performance in many language information processing tasks. Nevertheless, when general models are applied to some specific domains, e.g., Classical Chinese texts, their effectiveness is often unsatisfactory, and fine-tuning open-source foundational models similarly struggles to adequately incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To address this challenge, this study developed a large language model, AI Taiyan, specifically designed for understanding and generating Classical Chinese. Experiments show that with a reasonable model design, data processing, foundational training, and fine-tuning, satisfactory results can be achieved with only 1.8 billion parameters. In key tasks related to Classical Chinese information processing such as punctuation, identification of allusions, explanation of word meanings, and translation between ancient and modern Chinese, this model exhibits a clear advantage over both general-purpose large models and domain-specific traditional models, achieving levels close to or surpassing human baselines. This research provides a reference for the efficient construction of specialized domain-specific large language models. Furthermore, the paper discusses the application of this model in fields such as the collation of ancient texts, dictionary editing, and language research, combined with case studies.</description>

      <title>BELLE: A Bi-Level Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework for Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (QA) involves finding multiple relevant passages and performing step-by-step reasoning to answer complex questions. Previous works on multi-hop QA employ specific methods from different modeling perspectives based on large language models (LLMs), regardless of the question types. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of public multi-hop QA benchmarks, dividing the questions into four types and evaluating five types of cutting-edge methods for multi-hop QA: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Single-step, Iterative-step, Sub-step, and Adaptive-step. We find that different types of multi-hop questions have varying degrees of sensitivity to different types of methods. Thus, we propose a Bi-levEL muLti-agEnt reasoning (BELLE) framework to address multi-hop QA by specifically focusing on the correspondence between question types and methods, where each type of method is regarded as an ''operator'' by prompting LLMs differently. The first level of BELLE includes multiple agents that debate to obtain an executive plan of combined ''operators'' to address the multi-hop QA task comprehensively. During the debate, in addition to the basic roles of affirmative debater, negative debater, and judge, at the second level, we further leverage fast and slow debaters to monitor whether changes in viewpoints are reasonable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BELLE significantly outperforms strong baselines in various datasets. Additionally, the model consumption of BELLE is higher cost-effectiveness than that of single models in more complex multi-hop QA scenarios.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Model Learning for Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm, termed Chain-of-Model (CoM), which incorporates the causal relationship into the hidden states of each layer as a chain style, thereby introducing great scaling efficiency in model training and inference flexibility in deployment. We introduce the concept of Chain-of-Representation (CoR), which formulates the hidden states at each layer as a combination of multiple sub-representations (i.e., chains) at the hidden dimension level. In each layer, each chain from the output representations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input representations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can progressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the previous models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes for elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this principle, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the idea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture. Based on CoLM, we further introduce CoLM-Air by introducing a KV sharing mechanism, that computes all keys and values within the first chain and then shares across all chains. This design demonstrates additional extensibility, such as enabling seamless LM switching, prefilling acceleration and so on. Experimental results demonstrate our CoLM family can achieve comparable performance to the standard Transformer, while simultaneously enabling greater flexiblity, such as progressive scaling to improve training efficiency and offer multiple varying model sizes for elastic inference, paving a a new way toward building language models. Our code will be released in the future at: https://github.com/microsoft/CoLM.</description>

      <title>Not All Thoughts are Generated Equal: Efficient LLM Reasoning via Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressing long chain-of-thought (CoT) from large language models (LLMs) is an emerging strategy to improve the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. Despite its promising benefits, existing studies equally compress all thoughts within a long CoT, hindering more concise and effective reasoning. To this end, we first investigate the importance of different thoughts by examining their effectiveness and efficiency in contributing to reasoning through automatic long CoT chunking and Monte Carlo rollouts. Building upon the insights, we propose a theoretically bounded metric to jointly measure the effectiveness and efficiency of different thoughts. We then propose Long$\otimes$Short, an efficient reasoning framework that enables two LLMs to collaboratively solve the problem: a long-thought LLM for more effectively generating important thoughts, while a short-thought LLM for efficiently generating remaining thoughts. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a small amount of cold-start data to fine-tune LLMs for long-thought and short-thought reasoning styles, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a synergizing-oriented multi-turn reinforcement learning, focusing on the model self-evolution and collaboration between long-thought and short-thought LLMs. Experimental results show that our method enables Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B to achieve comparable performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, while reducing token length by over 80% across the MATH500, AIME24/25, AMC23, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.

      <title>Class Distillation with Mahalanobis Contrast: An Efficient Training Paradigm for Pragmatic Language Understanding Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting deviant language such as sexism, or nuanced language such as metaphors or sarcasm, is crucial for enhancing the safety, clarity, and interpretation of online social discourse. While existing classifiers deliver strong results on these tasks, they often come with significant computational cost and high data demands. In this work, we propose \textbf{Cla}ss \textbf{D}istillation (ClaD), a novel training paradigm that targets the core challenge: distilling a small, well-defined target class from a highly diverse and heterogeneous background. ClaD integrates two key innovations: (i) a loss function informed by the structural properties of class distributions, based on Mahalanobis distance, and (ii) an interpretable decision algorithm optimized for class separation. Across three benchmark detection tasks -- sexism, metaphor, and sarcasm -- ClaD outperforms competitive baselines, and even with smaller language models and orders of magnitude fewer parameters, achieves performance comparable to several large language models (LLMs). These results demonstrate ClaD as an efficient tool for pragmatic language understanding tasks that require gleaning a small target class from a larger heterogeneous background.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Collaborative Defense for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robustness and security of large language models (LLMs) has become a prominent research area. One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM safeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented languages, a simple yet effective method of "jailbreaking" these models. Despite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the safeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to enhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation between various attack features across different languages and propose Multilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that optimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate multilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages: First, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple languages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while minimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety misalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the effectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly used jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess various safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in underrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability of MCD. The results demonstrate that MCD outperforms existing approaches in safeguarding against multilingual jailbreak attempts while also exhibiting strong language transfer capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/HLiang-Lee/MCD.</description>

      <title>When AI Co-Scientists Fail: SPOT-a Benchmark for Automated Verification of Scientific Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled the vision of automated scientific discovery, often called AI Co-Scientists. To date, prior work casts these systems as generative co-authors responsible for crafting hypotheses, synthesizing code, or drafting manuscripts. In this work, we explore a complementary application: using LLMs as verifiers to automate the \textbf{academic verification of scientific manuscripts}. To that end, we introduce SPOT, a dataset of 83 published papers paired with 91 errors significant enough to prompt errata or retraction, cross-validated with actual authors and human annotators. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on SPOT, we find that none surpasses 21.1\% recall or 6.1\% precision (o3 achieves the best scores, with all others near zero). Furthermore, confidence estimates are uniformly low, and across eight independent runs, models rarely rediscover the same errors, undermining their reliability. Finally, qualitative analysis with domain experts reveals that even the strongest models make mistakes resembling student-level misconceptions derived from misunderstandings. These findings highlight the substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and the requirements for dependable AI-assisted academic verification.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model editing techniques are essential for efficiently updating knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of existing approaches degrades in massive editing scenarios, particularly when evaluated with practical metrics or in context-rich settings. We attribute these failures to embedding collisions among knowledge items, which undermine editing reliability at scale. To address this, we propose NAMET (Noise-aware Model Editing in Transformers), a simple yet effective method that introduces noise during memory extraction via a one-line modification to MEMIT. Extensive experiments across six LLMs and three datasets demonstrate that NAMET consistently outperforms existing methods when editing thousands of facts.</description>

      <title>AutoMedEval: Harnessing Language Models for Automatic Medical Capability Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, there is increasing demand for improved evaluation techniques to assess their capabilities. However, traditional metrics like F1 and ROUGE, which rely on token overlaps to measure quality, significantly overlook the importance of medical terminology. While human evaluation tends to be more reliable, it can be very costly and may as well suffer from inaccuracies due to limits in human expertise and motivation. Although there are some evaluation methods based on LLMs, their usability in the medical field is limited due to their proprietary nature or lack of expertise. To tackle these challenges, we present AutoMedEval, an open-sourced automatic evaluation model with 13B parameters specifically engineered to measure the question-answering proficiency of medical LLMs. The overarching objective of AutoMedEval is to assess the quality of responses produced by diverse models, aspiring to significantly reduce the dependence on human evaluation. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical training method involving curriculum instruction tuning and an iterative knowledge introspection mechanism, enabling AutoMedEval to acquire professional medical assessment capabilities with limited instructional data. Human evaluations indicate that AutoMedEval surpasses other baselines in terms of correlation with human judgments.</description>

      <title>Mobile-Bench-v2: A More Realistic and Comprehensive Benchmark for VLM-based Mobile Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VLM-based mobile agents are increasingly popular due to their capabilities to interact with smartphone GUIs and XML-structured texts and to complete daily tasks. However, existing online benchmarks struggle with obtaining stable reward signals due to dynamic environmental changes. Offline benchmarks evaluate the agents through single-path trajectories, which stands in contrast to the inherently multi-solution characteristics of GUI tasks. Additionally, both types of benchmarks fail to assess whether mobile agents can handle noise or engage in proactive interactions due to a lack of noisy apps or overly full instructions during the evaluation process. To address these limitations, we use a slot-based instruction generation method to construct a more realistic and comprehensive benchmark named Mobile-Bench-v2. Mobile-Bench-v2 includes a common task split, with offline multi-path evaluation to assess the agent's ability to obtain step rewards during task execution. It contains a noisy split based on pop-ups and ads apps, and a contaminated split named AITZ-Noise to formulate a real noisy environment. Furthermore, an ambiguous instruction split with preset Q\&amp;A interactions is released to evaluate the agent's proactive interaction capabilities. We conduct evaluations on these splits using the single-agent framework AppAgent-v1, the multi-agent framework Mobile-Agent-v2, as well as other mobile agents such as UI-Tars and OS-Atlas. Code and data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/xwk123/MobileBench-v2.</description>

      <title>RLAP: A Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Adaptive Planning Framework for Multi-step NLP Task Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-step planning has been widely employed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which decomposes the original task into multiple subtasks and guide LLMs to solve them sequentially without additional training. When addressing task instances, existing methods either preset the order of steps or attempt multiple paths at each step. However, these methods overlook instances' linguistic features and rely on the intrinsic planning capabilities of LLMs to evaluate intermediate feedback and then select subtasks, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To better solve multi-step NLP tasks with LLMs, in this paper we propose a Reinforcement Learning enhanced Adaptive Planning framework (RLAP). In our framework, we model an NLP task as a Markov decision process (MDP) and employ an LLM directly into the environment. In particular, a lightweight Actor model is trained to estimate Q-values for natural language sequences consisting of states and actions through reinforcement learning. Therefore, during sequential planning, the linguistic features of each sequence in the MDP can be taken into account, and the Actor model interacts with the LLM to determine the optimal order of subtasks for each task instance. We apply RLAP on three different types of NLP tasks and conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets to verify RLAP's effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>Recursive Question Understanding for Complex Question Answering over Heterogeneous Personal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question answering over mixed sources, like text and tables, has been advanced by verbalizing all contents and encoding it with a language model. A prominent case of such heterogeneous data is personal information: user devices log vast amounts of data every day, such as calendar entries, workout statistics, shopping records, streaming history, and more. Information needs range from simple look-ups to queries of analytical nature. The challenge is to provide humans with convenient access with small footprint, so that all personal data stays on the user devices. We present ReQAP, a novel method that creates an executable operator tree for a given question, via recursive decomposition. Operators are designed to enable seamless integration of structured and unstructured sources, and the execution of the operator tree yields a traceable answer. We further release the PerQA benchmark, with persona-based data and questions, covering a diverse spectrum of realistic user needs.</description>

      <title>ELITE: Embedding-Less retrieval with Iterative Text Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural language processing, but their limited ability to retain long-term context constrains performance on document-level or multi-turn tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by retrieving relevant information from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems often rely on embedding-based retrieval trained on corpus-level semantic similarity, which can lead to retrieving content that is semantically similar in form but misaligned with the question's true intent. Furthermore, recent RAG variants construct graph- or hierarchy-based structures to improve retrieval accuracy, resulting in significant computation and storage overhead. In this paper, we propose an embedding-free retrieval framework. Our method leverages the logical inferencing ability of LLMs in retrieval using iterative search space refinement guided by our novel importance measure and extend our retrieval results with logically related information without explicit graph construction. Experiments on long-context QA benchmarks, including NovelQA and Marathon, show that our approach outperforms strong baselines while reducing storage and runtime by over an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Complex Instruction Following for Large Language Models with Mixture-of-Contexts Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in handling natural language tasks; however, they may struggle to consistently follow complex instructions including those involve multiple constraints. Post-training LLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to improve their ability to follow instructions. In addressing complex instruction following, existing efforts primarily focus on data-driven methods that synthesize complex instruction-output pairs for SFT. However, insufficient attention allocated to crucial sub-contexts may reduce the effectiveness of SFT. In this work, we propose transforming sequentially structured input instruction into multiple parallel instructions containing subcontexts. To support processing this multi-input, we propose MISO (Multi-Input Single-Output), an extension to currently dominant decoder-only transformer-based LLMs. MISO introduces a mixture-of-contexts paradigm that jointly considers the overall instruction-output alignment and the influence of individual sub-contexts to enhance SFT effectiveness. We apply MISO fine-tuning to complex instructionfollowing datasets and evaluate it with standard LLM inference. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of MISO as a fine-tuning method for LLMs, both in terms of effectiveness in complex instruction-following scenarios and its potential for training efficiency.</description>

      <title>An Explanation of Intrinsic Self-Correction via Linear Representations and Latent Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explanation for the performance gains of intrinsic self-correction, a process where a language model iteratively refines its outputs without external feedback. More precisely, we investigate how prompting induces interpretable changes in hidden states and thus affects the output distributions. We hypothesize that each prompt-induced shift lies in a linear span of some linear representation vectors, naturally separating tokens based on individual concept alignment. Building around this idea, we give a mathematical formulation of self-correction and derive a concentration result for output tokens based on alignment magnitudes. Our experiments on text detoxification with zephyr-7b-sft reveal a substantial gap in the inner products of the prompt-induced shifts and the unembeddings of the top-100 most toxic tokens vs. those of the unembeddings of the bottom-100 least toxic tokens, under toxic instructions. This suggests that self-correction prompts enhance a language model's capability of latent concept recognition. Our analysis offers insights into the underlying mechanism of self-correction by characterizing how prompting works explainably. For reproducibility, our code is available.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Query Compiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise recognition of search intent in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remains a challenging goal, especially under resource constraints and for complex queries with nested structures and dependencies. This paper presents QCompiler, a neuro-symbolic framework inspired by linguistic grammar rules and compiler design, to bridge this gap. It theoretically designs a minimal yet sufficient Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar $G[q]$ to formalize complex queries. Unlike previous methods, this grammar maintains completeness while minimizing redundancy. Based on this, QCompiler includes a Query Expression Translator, a Lexical Syntax Parser, and a Recursive Descent Processor to compile queries into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for execution. The atomicity of the sub-queries in the leaf nodes ensures more precise document retrieval and response generation, significantly improving the RAG system's ability to address complex queries.</description>

      <title>ChartEdit: How Far Are MLLMs From Automating Chart Analysis? Evaluating MLLMs' Capability via Chart Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in generating chart rendering code, chart editing presents a greater challenge. This difficulty stems from its nature as a labor-intensive task for humans that also demands MLLMs to integrate chart understanding, complex reasoning, and precise intent interpretation. While many MLLMs claim such editing capabilities, current assessments typically rely on limited case studies rather than robust evaluation methodologies, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive evaluation framework. In this work, we propose ChartEdit, a new high-quality benchmark designed for chart editing tasks. This benchmark comprises $1,405$ diverse editing instructions applied to $233$ real-world charts, with each instruction-chart instance having been manually annotated and validated for accuracy. Utilizing ChartEdit, we evaluate the performance of 10 mainstream MLLMs across two types of experiments, assessing them at both the code and chart levels. The results suggest that large-scale models can generate code to produce images that partially match the reference images. However, their ability to generate accurate edits according to the instructions remains limited. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) model achieves a score of only $59.96$, highlighting significant challenges in precise modification. In contrast, small-scale models, including chart-domain models, struggle both with following editing instructions and generating overall chart images, underscoring the need for further development in this area.

      <title>Counterspeech the ultimate shield! Multi-Conditioned Counterspeech Generation through Attributed Prefix Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterspeech has proven to be a powerful tool to combat hate speech online. Previous studies have focused on generating counterspeech conditioned only on specific intents (single attributed). However, a holistic approach considering multiple attributes simultaneously can yield more nuanced and effective responses. Here, we introduce HiPPrO, Hierarchical Prefix learning with Preference Optimization, a novel two-stage framework that utilizes the effectiveness of attribute-specific prefix embedding spaces hierarchically optimized during the counterspeech generation process in the first phase. Thereafter, we incorporate both reference and reward-free preference optimization to generate more constructive counterspeech. Furthermore, we extend IntentCONANv2 by annotating all 13,973 counterspeech instances with emotion labels by five annotators. HiPPrO leverages hierarchical prefix optimization to integrate these dual attributes effectively. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that HiPPrO achieves a ~38 % improvement in intent conformity and a ~3 %, ~2 %, ~3 % improvement in Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L, respectively, compared to several baseline models. Human evaluations further substantiate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the enhanced relevance and appropriateness of the generated counterspeech. This work underscores the potential of multi-attribute conditioning in advancing the efficacy of counterspeech generation systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces a bilingual dataset comprising 23,456 entries for Arabic and 10,036 entries for English, annotated for emotions and hope speech, addressing the scarcity of multi-emotion (Emotion and hope) datasets. The dataset provides comprehensive annotations capturing emotion intensity, complexity, and causes, alongside detailed classifications and subcategories for hope speech. To ensure annotation reliability, Fleiss' Kappa was employed, revealing 0.75-0.85 agreement among annotators both for Arabic and English language. The evaluation metrics (micro-F1-Score=0.67) obtained from the baseline model (i.e., using a machine learning model) validate that the data annotations are worthy. This dataset offers a valuable resource for advancing natural language processing in underrepresented languages, fostering better cross-linguistic analysis of emotions and hope speech.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the system developed by the Central China Normal University (CCNU) team for the Mu-SHROOM shared task, which focuses on identifying hallucinations in question-answering systems across 14 different languages. Our approach leverages multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) with distinct areas of expertise, employing them in parallel to annotate hallucinations, effectively simulating a crowdsourcing annotation process. Furthermore, each LLM-based annotator integrates both internal and external knowledge related to the input during the annotation process. Using the open-source LLM DeepSeek-V3, our system achieves the top ranking (\#1) for Hindi data and secures a Top-5 position in seven other languages. In this paper, we also discuss unsuccessful approaches explored during our development process and share key insights gained from participating in this shared task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying hate speech content in the Arabic language is challenging due to the rich quality of dialectal variations. This study introduces a multilabel hate speech dataset in the Arabic language. We have collected 10000 Arabic tweets and annotated each tweet, whether it contains offensive content or not. If a text contains offensive content, we further classify it into different hate speech targets such as religion, gender, politics, ethnicity, origin, and others. A text can contain either single or multiple targets. Multiple annotators are involved in the data annotation task. We calculated the inter-annotator agreement, which was reported to be 0.86 for offensive content and 0.71 for multiple hate speech targets. Finally, we evaluated the data annotation task by employing a different transformers-based model in which AraBERTv2 outperformed with a micro-F1 score of 0.7865 and an accuracy of 0.786.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Knowledge Utilization Mechanisms in LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the inherent limitations of parametric knowledge in large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely employed to expand their knowledge scope. Since RAG has shown promise in knowledge-intensive tasks like open-domain question answering, its broader application to complex tasks and intelligent assistants has further advanced its utility. Despite this progress, the underlying knowledge utilization mechanisms of LLM-based RAG remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the intrinsic mechanisms by which LLMs integrate internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge in RAG scenarios. Specially, we employ knowledge stream analysis at the macroscopic level, and investigate the function of individual modules at the microscopic level. Drawing on knowledge streaming analyses, we decompose the knowledge utilization process into four distinct stages within LLM layers: knowledge refinement, knowledge elicitation, knowledge expression, and knowledge contestation. We further demonstrate that the relevance of passages guides the streaming of knowledge through these stages. At the module level, we introduce a new method, knowledge activation probability entropy (KAPE) for neuron identification associated with either internal or external knowledge. By selectively deactivating these neurons, we achieve targeted shifts in the LLM's reliance on one knowledge source over the other. Moreover, we discern complementary roles for multi-head attention and multi-layer perceptron layers during knowledge formation. These insights offer a foundation for improving interpretability and reliability in retrieval-augmented LLMs, paving the way for more robust and transparent generative solutions in knowledge-intensive domains.</description>

Abstract: Argument mining has garnered increasing attention over the years, with the recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) further propelling this trend. However, current argument relations remain relatively simplistic and foundational, struggling to capture the full scope of argument information, particularly when it comes to representing complex argument structures in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose 14 fine-grained relation types from both vertical and horizontal dimensions, thereby capturing the intricate interplay between argument components for a thorough understanding of argument structure. On this basis, we conducted extensive experiments on three tasks: argument component detection, relation prediction, and automated essay grading. Additionally, we explored the impact of writing quality on argument component detection and relation prediction, as well as the connections between discourse relations and argumentative features. The findings highlight the importance of fine-grained argumentative annotations for argumentative writing quality assessment and encourage multi-dimensional argument analysis.</description>

      <title>MoL for LLMs: Dual-Loss Optimization to Enhance Domain Expertise While Preserving General Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although LLMs perform well in general tasks, domain-specific applications suffer from hallucinations and accuracy limitations. CPT approaches encounter two key issues: (1) domain-biased data degrades general language skills, and (2) improper corpus-mixture ratios limit effective adaptation. To address these, we propose a novel framework, Mixture of Losses (MoL), which decouples optimization objectives for domain-specific and general corpora. Specifically, cross-entropy (CE) loss is applied to domain data to ensure knowledge acquisition, while Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence aligns general-corpus training with the base model's foundational capabilities. This dual-loss architecture preserves universal skills while enhancing domain expertise, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, we validate that a 1:1 domain-to-general corpus ratio optimally balances training and overfitting without the need for extensive tuning or resource-intensive experiments. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate significant performance gains compared to traditional CPT approaches, which often suffer from degradation in general language capabilities; our model achieves 27.9% higher accuracy on the Math-500 benchmark in the non-think reasoning mode, and an impressive 83.3% improvement on the challenging AIME25 subset in the think mode, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>ABoN: Adaptive Best-of-N Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in test-time alignment methods, such as Best-of-N sampling, offer a simple and effective way to steer language models (LMs) toward preferred behaviors using reward models (RM). However, these approaches can be computationally expensive, especially when applied uniformly across prompts without accounting for differences in alignment difficulty. In this work, we propose a prompt-adaptive strategy for Best-of-N alignment that allocates inference-time compute more efficiently. Motivated by latency concerns, we develop a two-stage algorithm: an initial exploratory phase estimates the reward distribution for each prompt using a small exploration budget, and a second stage adaptively allocates the remaining budget using these estimates. Our method is simple, practical, and compatible with any LM/RM combination. Empirical results on the AlpacaEval dataset for 12 LM/RM pairs and 50 different batches of prompts show that our adaptive strategy consistently outperforms the uniform allocation with the same inference budget. Moreover, our experiments show that our adaptive strategy remains competitive against uniform allocations with 20% larger inference budgets and even improves in performance as the batch size grows.</description>

      <title>GenderBench: Evaluation Suite for Gender Biases in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GenderBench -- a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to measure gender biases in LLMs. GenderBench includes 14 probes that quantify 19 gender-related harmful behaviors exhibited by LLMs. We release GenderBench as an open-source and extensible library to improve the reproducibility and robustness of benchmarking across the field. We also publish our evaluation of 12 LLMs. Our measurements reveal consistent patterns in their behavior. We show that LLMs struggle with stereotypical reasoning, equitable gender representation in generated texts, and occasionally also with discriminatory behavior in high-stakes scenarios, such as hiring.</description>

      <title>Why Not Act on What You Know? Unleashing Safety Potential of LLMs via Self-Aware Guard Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks but remain vulnerable to meticulously crafted jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we identify a critical safety gap: while LLMs are adept at detecting jailbreak prompts, they often produce unsafe responses when directly processing these inputs. Inspired by this insight, we propose SAGE (Self-Aware Guard Enhancement), a training-free defense strategy designed to align LLMs' strong safety discrimination performance with their relatively weaker safety generation ability. SAGE consists of two core components: a Discriminative Analysis Module and a Discriminative Response Module, enhancing resilience against sophisticated jailbreak attempts through flexible safety discrimination instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAGE's effectiveness and robustness across various open-source and closed-source LLMs of different sizes and architectures, achieving an average 99% defense success rate against numerous complex and covert jailbreak methods while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. We further conduct mechanistic interpretability analysis through hidden states and attention distributions, revealing the underlying mechanisms of this detection-generation discrepancy. Our work thus contributes to developing future LLMs with coherent safety awareness and generation behavior. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/SAGE.</description>

      <title>Historical and psycholinguistic perspectives on morphological productivity: A sketch of an integrative approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we approach morphological productivity from two perspectives: a cognitive-computational perspective, and a diachronic perspective zooming in on an actual speaker, Thomas Mann. For developing the first perspective, we make use of a cognitive computational model of the mental lexicon, the discriminative lexicon model. For computational mappings between form and meaning to be productive, in the sense that novel, previously unencountered words, can be understood and produced, there must be systematicities between the form space and the semantic space. If the relation between form and meaning would be truly arbitrary, a model could memorize form and meaning pairings, but there is no way in which the model would be able to generalize to novel test data. For Finnish nominal inflection, Malay derivation, and English compounding, we explore, using the Discriminative Lexicon Model as a computational tool, to trace differences in the degree to which inflectional and word formation patterns are productive. We show that the DLM tends to associate affix-like sublexical units with the centroids of the embeddings of the words with a given affix. For developing the second perspective, we study how the intake and output of one prolific writer, Thomas Mann, changes over time. We show by means of an examination of what Thomas Mann is likely to have read, and what he wrote, that the rate at which Mann produces novel derived words is extremely low. There are far more novel words in his input than in his output. We show that Thomas Mann is less likely to produce a novel derived word with a given suffix the greater the average distance is of the embeddings of all derived words to the corresponding centroid, and discuss the challenges of using speaker-specific embeddings for low-frequency and novel words.</description>

      <title>Do different prompting methods yield a common task representation in language models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstrations and instructions are two primary approaches for prompting language models to perform in-context learning (ICL) tasks. Do identical tasks elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through function vectors, recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task representations. We generalize function vectors to alternative task presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different task presentations do not induce a common task representation but elicit different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support to the practice of combining textual instructions and task demonstrations, imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Model Merging in Pre-training of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing large language models, though its application in large-scale pre-training remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of model merging techniques during the pre-training process. Through extensive experiments with both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ranging from millions to over 100 billion parameters, we demonstrate that merging checkpoints trained with constant learning rates not only achieves significant performance improvements but also enables accurate prediction of annealing behavior. These improvements lead to both more efficient model development and significantly lower training costs. Our detailed ablation studies on merging strategies and hyperparameters provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms while uncovering novel applications. Through comprehensive experimental analysis, we offer the open-source community practical pre-training guidelines for effective model merging.</description>

      <title>Personalized Author Obfuscation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in obfuscating authorship by paraphrasing and altering writing styles. Rather than adopting a holistic approach that evaluates performance across the entire dataset, we focus on user-wise performance to analyze how obfuscation effectiveness varies across individual authors. While LLMs are generally effective, we observe a bimodal distribution of efficacy, with performance varying significantly across users. To address this, we propose a personalized prompting method that outperforms standard prompting techniques and partially mitigates the bimodality issue.</description>

      <title>Improving Fairness in LLMs Through Testing-Time Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) push the bound-aries in natural language processing and generative AI, driving progress across various aspects of modern society. Unfortunately, the pervasive issue of bias in LLMs responses (i.e., predictions) poses a significant and open challenge, hindering their application in tasks involving ethical sensitivity and responsible decision-making. In this work, we propose a straightforward, user-friendly and practical method to mitigate such biases, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs. Our method creates multiple variations of a given sentence by modifying specific attributes and evaluates the corresponding prediction behavior compared to the original, unaltered, prediction/sentence. The idea behind this process is that critical ethical predictions often exhibit notable inconsistencies, indicating the presence of bias. Unlike previous approaches, our method relies solely on forward passes (i.e., testing-time adversaries), eliminating the need for training, fine-tuning, or prior knowledge of the training data distribution. Through extensive experiments on the popular Llama family, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving various fairness metrics, focusing on the reduction of disparities in how the model treats individuals from different racial groups. Specifically, using standard metrics, we improve the fairness in Llama3 in up to 27 percentage points. Overall, our approach significantly enhances fairness, equity, and reliability in LLM-generated results without parameter tuning or training data modifications, confirming its effectiveness in practical scenarios. We believe our work establishes an important step toward enabling the use of LLMs in tasks that require ethical considerations and responsible decision-making.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Benchmark for Abusive Language Detection in Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content moderation research has recently made significant advances, but still fails to serve the majority of the world's languages due to the lack of resources, leaving millions of vulnerable users to online hostility. This work presents a large-scale human-annotated multi-task benchmark dataset for abusive language detection in Tigrinya social media with joint annotations for three tasks: abusiveness, sentiment, and topic classification. The dataset comprises 13,717 YouTube comments annotated by nine native speakers, collected from 7,373 videos with a total of over 1.2 billion views across 51 channels. We developed an iterative term clustering approach for effective data selection. Recognizing that around 64% of Tigrinya social media content uses Romanized transliterations rather than native Ge'ez script, our dataset accommodates both writing systems to reflect actual language use. We establish strong baselines across the tasks in the benchmark, while leaving significant challenges for future contributions. Our experiments reveal that small, specialized multi-task models outperform the current frontier models in the low-resource setting, achieving up to 86% accuracy (+7 points) in abusiveness detection. We make the resources publicly available to promote research on online safety.</description>

      <title>The AI Gap: How Socioeconomic Status Affects Language Technology Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Socioeconomic status (SES) fundamentally influences how people interact with each other and more recently, with digital technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous research has highlighted the interaction between SES and language technology, it was limited by reliance on proxy metrics and synthetic data. We survey 1,000 individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds about their use of language technologies and generative AI, and collect 6,482 prompts from their previous interactions with LLMs. We find systematic differences across SES groups in language technology usage (i.e., frequency, performed tasks), interaction styles, and topics. Higher SES entails a higher level of abstraction, convey requests more concisely, and topics like 'inclusivity' and 'travel'. Lower SES correlates with higher anthropomorphization of LLMs (using ''hello'' and ''thank you'') and more concrete language. Our findings suggest that while generative language technologies are becoming more accessible to everyone, socioeconomic linguistic differences still stratify their use to exacerbate the digital divide. These differences underscore the importance of considering SES in developing language technologies to accommodate varying linguistic needs rooted in socioeconomic factors and limit the AI Gap across SES groups.</description>

      <title>Emotion Recognition for Low-Resource Turkish: Fine-Tuning BERTurk on TREMO and Testing on Xenophobic Political Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) play a crucial role in shaping public discourse and societal norms. This study examines the term Sessiz Istila (Silent Invasion) on Turkish social media, highlighting the rise of anti-refugee sentiment amidst the Syrian refugee influx. Using BERTurk and the TREMO dataset, we developed an advanced Emotion Recognition Model (ERM) tailored for Turkish, achieving 92.62% accuracy in categorizing emotions such as happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise. By applying this model to large-scale X data, the study uncovers emotional nuances in Turkish discourse, contributing to computational social science by advancing sentiment analysis in underrepresented languages and enhancing our understanding of global digital discourse and the unique linguistic challenges of Turkish. The findings underscore the transformative potential of localized NLP tools, with our ERM model offering practical applications for real-time sentiment analysis in Turkish-language contexts. By addressing critical areas, including marketing, public relations, and crisis management, these models facilitate improved decision-making through timely and accurate sentiment tracking. This highlights the significance of advancing research that accounts for regional and linguistic nuances.</description>

      <title>Truth Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable success and deployment across diverse workflows, language models sometimes produce untruthful responses. Our limited understanding of how truthfulness is mechanistically encoded within these models jeopardizes their reliability and safety. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying representations of truthfulness at the neuron level. We show that language models contain truth neurons, which encode truthfulness in a subject-agnostic manner. Experiments conducted across models of varying scales validate the existence of truth neurons, confirming that the encoding of truthfulness at the neuron level is a property shared by many language models. The distribution patterns of truth neurons over layers align with prior findings on the geometry of truthfulness. Selectively suppressing the activations of truth neurons found through the TruthfulQA dataset degrades performance both on TruthfulQA and on other benchmarks, showing that the truthfulness mechanisms are not tied to a specific dataset. Our results offer novel insights into the mechanisms underlying truthfulness in language models and highlight potential directions toward improving their trustworthiness and reliability.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Mind of Large Language Models: A Quantitative Evaluation of Ideology and Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various sectors has highlighted the need for empirical research to understand their biases, thought patterns, and societal implications to ensure ethical and effective use. In this study, we propose a novel framework for evaluating LLMs, focusing on uncovering their ideological biases through a quantitative analysis of 436 binary-choice questions, many of which have no definitive answer. By applying our framework to ChatGPT and Gemini, findings revealed that while LLMs generally maintain consistent opinions on many topics, their ideologies differ across models and languages. Notably, ChatGPT exhibits a tendency to change their opinion to match the questioner's opinion. Both models also exhibited problematic biases, unethical or unfair claims, which might have negative societal impacts. These results underscore the importance of addressing both ideological and ethical considerations when evaluating LLMs. The proposed framework offers a flexible, quantitative method for assessing LLM behavior, providing valuable insights for the development of more socially aligned AI systems.</description>

Abstract: The impressive linguistic abilities of large language models (LLMs) have recommended them as models of human sentence processing, with some conjecturing a positive 'quality-power' relationship (Wilcox et al., 2023), in which language models' (LMs') fit to psychometric data continues to improve as their ability to predict words in context increases. This is important because it suggests that elements of LLM architecture, such as veridical attention to context and a unique objective of predicting upcoming words, reflect the architecture of the human sentence processing faculty, and that any inadequacies in predicting human reading time and brain imaging data may be attributed to insufficient model complexity, which recedes as larger models become available. Recent studies (Oh and Schuler, 2023) have shown this scaling inverts after a point, as LMs become excessively large and accurate, when word prediction probability (as information-theoretic surprisal) is used as a predictor. Other studies propose the use of entire vectors from differently sized LLMs, still showing positive scaling (Schrimpf et al., 2021), casting doubt on the value of surprisal as a predictor, but do not control for the larger number of predictors in vectors from larger LMs. This study evaluates LLM scaling using entire LLM vectors, while controlling for the larger number of predictors in vectors from larger LLMs. Results show that inverse scaling obtains, suggesting that inadequacies in predicting human reading time and brain imaging data may be due to substantial misalignment between LLMs and human sentence processing, which worsens as larger models are used.</description>

      <title>How Reliable is Multilingual LLM-as-a-Judge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a popular evaluation strategy, where advanced large language models assess generation results in alignment with human instructions. While these models serve as a promising alternative to human annotators, their reliability in multilingual evaluation remains uncertain. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multilingual LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we evaluate five models from different model families across five diverse tasks involving 25 languages. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle to achieve consistent judgment results across languages, with an average Fleiss' Kappa of approximately 0.3, and some models performing even worse. To investigate the cause of inconsistency, we analyze various influencing factors. We observe that consistency varies significantly across languages, with particularly poor performance in low-resource languages. Additionally, we find that neither training on multilingual data nor increasing model scale directly improves judgment consistency. These findings suggest that LLMs are not yet reliable for evaluating multilingual predictions. We finally propose an ensemble strategy which improves the consistency of the multilingual judge in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Data Whisperer: Efficient Data Selection for Task-Specific LLM Fine-Tuning via Few-Shot In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on task-specific data is essential for their effective deployment. As dataset sizes grow, efficiently selecting optimal subsets for training becomes crucial to balancing performance and computational costs. Traditional data selection methods often require fine-tuning a scoring model on the target dataset, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive, or rely on heuristics that fail to fully leverage the model's predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Data Whisperer, an efficient, training-free, attention-based method that leverages few-shot in-context learning with the model to be fine-tuned. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted on both raw and synthetic datasets across diverse tasks and models. Notably, Data Whisperer achieves superior performance compared to the full GSM8K dataset on the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using just 10% of the data, and outperforms existing methods with a 3.1-point improvement and a 7.4$\times$ speedup.</description>

      <title>GMSA: Enhancing Context Compression via Group Merging and Layer Semantic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, when applied to long-context scenarios, they face two challenges, i.e., low computational efficiency and much redundant information. This paper introduces GMSA, a context compression framework based on the encoder-decoder architecture, which addresses these challenges by reducing input sequence length and redundant information. Structurally, GMSA has two key components: Group Merging and Layer Semantic Alignment (LSA). Group merging is used to effectively and efficiently extract summary vectors from the original context. Layer semantic alignment, on the other hand, aligns the high-level summary vectors with the low-level primary input semantics, thus bridging the semantic gap between different layers. In the training process, GMSA first learns soft tokens that contain complete semantics through autoencoder training. To furtherly adapt GMSA to downstream tasks, we propose Knowledge Extraction Fine-tuning (KEFT) to extract knowledge from the soft tokens for downstream tasks. We train GMSA by randomly sampling the compression rate for each sample in the dataset. Under this condition, GMSA not only significantly outperforms the traditional compression paradigm in context restoration but also achieves stable and significantly faster convergence with only a few encoder layers. In downstream question-answering (QA) tasks, GMSA can achieve approximately a 2x speedup in end-to-end inference while outperforming both the original input prompts and various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin.</description>

      <title>One-for-All Pruning: A Universal Model for Customized Compression of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing pruning methods for large language models (LLMs) focus on achieving high compression rates while maintaining model performance. Although these methods have demonstrated satisfactory performance in handling a single user's compression request, their processing time increases linearly with the number of requests, making them inefficient for real-world scenarios with multiple simultaneous requests. To address this limitation, we propose a Univeral Model for Customized Compression (UniCuCo) for LLMs, which introduces a StratNet that learns to map arbitrary requests to their optimal pruning strategy. The challenge in training StratNet lies in the high computational cost of evaluating pruning strategies and the non-differentiable nature of the pruning process, which hinders gradient backpropagation for StratNet updates. To overcome these challenges, we leverage a Gaussian process to approximate the evaluation process. Since the gradient of the Gaussian process is computable, we can use it to approximate the gradient of the non-differentiable pruning process, thereby enabling StratNet updates. Experimental results show that UniCuCo is 28 times faster than baselines in processing 64 requests, while maintaining comparable accuracy to baselines.</description>

      <title>Examining Linguistic Shifts in Academic Writing Before and After the Launch of ChatGPT: A Study on Preprint Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have prompted academic concerns about their impact on academic writing. Existing studies have primarily examined LLM usage in academic writing through quantitative approaches, such as word frequency statistics and probability-based analyses. However, few have systematically examined the potential impact of LLMs on the linguistic characteristics of academic writing. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale analysis across 823,798 abstracts published in last decade from arXiv dataset. Through the linguistic analysis of features such as the frequency of LLM-preferred words, lexical complexity, syntactic complexity, cohesion, readability and sentiment, the results indicate a significant increase in the proportion of LLM-preferred words in abstracts, revealing the widespread influence of LLMs on academic writing. Additionally, we observed an increase in lexical complexity and sentiment in the abstracts, but a decrease in syntactic complexity, suggesting that LLMs introduce more new vocabulary and simplify sentence structure. However, the significant decrease in cohesion and readability indicates that abstracts have fewer connecting words and are becoming more difficult to read. Moreover, our analysis reveals that scholars with weaker English proficiency were more likely to use the LLMs for academic writing, and focused on improving the overall logic and fluency of the abstracts. Finally, at discipline level, we found that scholars in Computer Science showed more pronounced changes in writing style, while the changes in Mathematics were minimal.</description>

      <title>Bridging Generative and Discriminative Learning: Few-Shot Relation Extraction via Two-Stage Knowledge-Guided Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-Shot Relation Extraction (FSRE) remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated data and the limited generalization capabilities of existing models. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in FSRE through in-context learning (ICL), their general-purpose training objectives often result in suboptimal performance for task-specific relation extraction. To overcome these challenges, we propose TKRE (Two-Stage Knowledge-Guided Pre-training for Relation Extraction), a novel framework that synergistically integrates LLMs with traditional relation extraction models, bridging generative and discriminative learning paradigms. TKRE introduces two key innovations: (1) leveraging LLMs to generate explanation-driven knowledge and schema-constrained synthetic data, addressing the issue of data scarcity; and (2) a two-stage pre-training strategy combining Masked Span Language Modeling (MSLM) and Span-Level Contrastive Learning (SCL) to enhance relational reasoning and generalization. Together, these components enable TKRE to effectively tackle FSRE tasks. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TKRE, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in FSRE and underscoring its potential for broader application in low-resource scenarios. \footnote{The code and data are released on https://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/TKRE.</description>

      <title>PANORAMA: A synthetic PII-laced dataset for studying sensitive data memorization in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The memorization of sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII) by large language models (LLMs) poses growing privacy risks as models scale and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Existing efforts to study sensitive and PII data memorization and develop mitigation strategies are hampered by the absence of comprehensive, realistic, and ethically sourced datasets reflecting the diversity of sensitive information found on the web. We introduce PANORAMA - Profile-based Assemblage for Naturalistic Online Representation and Attribute Memorization Analysis, a large-scale synthetic corpus of 384,789 samples derived from 9,674 synthetic profiles designed to closely emulate the distribution, variety, and context of PII and sensitive data as it naturally occurs in online environments. Our data generation pipeline begins with the construction of internally consistent, multi-attribute human profiles using constrained selection to reflect real-world demographics such as education, health attributes, financial status, etc. Using a combination of zero-shot prompting and OpenAI o3-mini, we generate diverse content types - including wiki-style articles, social media posts, forum discussions, online reviews, comments, and marketplace listings - each embedding realistic, contextually appropriate PII and other sensitive information. We validate the utility of PANORAMA by fine-tuning the Mistral-7B model on 1x, 5x, 10x, and 25x data replication rates with a subset of data and measure PII memorization rates - revealing not only consistent increases with repetition but also variation across content types, highlighting PANORAMA's ability to model how memorization risks differ by context. Our dataset and code are publicly available, providing a much-needed resource for privacy risk assessment, model auditing, and the development of privacy-preserving LLMs.</description>

      <title>Distribution Prompting: Understanding the Expressivity of Language Models Through the Next-Token Distributions They Can Produce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive neural language models (LMs) generate a probability distribution over tokens at each time step given a prompt. In this work, we attempt to systematically understand the probability distributions that LMs can produce, showing that some distributions are significantly harder to elicit than others. Specifically, for any target next-token distribution over the vocabulary, we attempt to find a prompt that induces the LM to output a distribution as close as possible to the target, using either soft or hard gradient-based prompt tuning. We find that (1) in general, distributions with very low or very high entropy are easier to approximate than those with moderate entropy; (2) among distributions with the same entropy, those containing ''outlier tokens'' are easier to approximate; (3) target distributions generated by LMs -- even LMs with different tokenizers -- are easier to approximate than randomly chosen targets. These results offer insights into the expressiveness of LMs and the challenges of using them as probability distribution proposers.</description>

      <title>Not All Documents Are What You Need for Extracting Instruction Tuning Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction tuning improves the performance of large language models (LLMs), but it heavily relies on high-quality training data. Recently, LLMs have been used to synthesize instruction data using seed question-answer (QA) pairs. However, these synthesized instructions often lack diversity and tend to be similar to the input seeds, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose extracting instruction tuning data from web corpora that contain rich and diverse knowledge. A naive solution is to retrieve domain-specific documents and extract all QA pairs from them, but this faces two key challenges: (1) extracting all QA pairs using LLMs is prohibitively expensive, and (2) many extracted QA pairs may be irrelevant to the downstream tasks, potentially degrading model performance. To tackle these issues, we introduce EQUAL, an effective and scalable data extraction framework that iteratively alternates between document selection and high-quality QA pair extraction to enhance instruction tuning. EQUAL first clusters the document corpus based on embeddings derived from contrastive learning, then uses a multi-armed bandit strategy to efficiently identify clusters that are likely to contain valuable QA pairs. This iterative approach significantly reduces computational cost while boosting model performance. Experiments on AutoMathText and StackOverflow across four downstream tasks show that EQUAL reduces computational costs by 5-10x and improves accuracy by 2.5 percent on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B</description>

      <title>Teach2Eval: An Indirect Evaluation Method for LLM by Judging How It Teaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the development of effective evaluation methods. Traditional benchmarks rely on task-specific metrics and static datasets, which often suffer from fairness issues, limited scalability, and contamination risks. In this paper, we introduce Teach2Eval, an indirect evaluation framework inspired by the Feynman Technique. Instead of directly testing LLMs on predefined tasks, our method evaluates a model's multiple abilities to teach weaker student models to perform tasks effectively. By converting open-ended tasks into standardized multiple-choice questions (MCQs) through teacher-generated feedback, Teach2Eval enables scalable, automated, and multi-dimensional assessment. Our approach not only avoids data leakage and memorization but also captures a broad range of cognitive abilities that are orthogonal to current benchmarks. Experimental results across 26 leading LLMs show strong alignment with existing human and model-based dynamic rankings, while offering additional interpretability for training guidance.</description>

      <title>Learning Auxiliary Tasks Improves Reference-Free Hallucination Detection in Open-Domain Long-Form Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of factually incorrect information, remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), especially in open-domain long-form generation. Existing approaches for detecting hallucination in long-form tasks either focus on limited domains or rely heavily on external fact-checking tools, which may not always be available.
  In this work, we systematically investigate reference-free hallucination detection in open-domain long-form responses. Our findings reveal that internal states (e.g., model's output probability and entropy) alone are insufficient for reliably (i.e., better than random guessing) distinguishing between factual and hallucinated content. To enhance detection, we explore various existing approaches, including prompting-based methods, probing, and fine-tuning, with fine-tuning proving the most effective. To further improve the accuracy, we introduce a new paradigm, named RATE-FT, that augments fine-tuning with an auxiliary task for the model to jointly learn with the main task of hallucination detection. With extensive experiments and analysis using a variety of model families &amp; datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, e.g., +3% over general fine-tuning methods on LongFact.</description>

      <title>$K$-MSHC: Unmasking Minimally Sufficient Head Circuits in Large Language Models with Experiments on Syntactic Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding which neural components drive specific capabilities in mid-sized language models ($\leq$10B parameters) remains a key challenge. We introduce the $(\bm{K}, \epsilon)$-Minimum Sufficient Head Circuit ($K$-MSHC), a methodology to identify minimal sets of attention heads crucial for classification tasks as well as Search-K-MSHC, an efficient algorithm for discovering these circuits. Applying our Search-K-MSHC algorithm to Gemma-9B, we analyze three syntactic task families: grammar acceptability, arithmetic verification, and arithmetic word problems. Our findings reveal distinct task-specific head circuits, with grammar tasks predominantly utilizing early layers, word problems showing pronounced activity in both shallow and deep regions, and arithmetic verification demonstrating a more distributed pattern across the network. We discover non-linear circuit overlap patterns, where different task pairs share computational components at varying levels of importance. While grammar and arithmetic share many "weak" heads, arithmetic and word problems share more consistently critical "strong" heads. Importantly, we find that each task maintains dedicated "super-heads" with minimal cross-task overlap, suggesting that syntactic and numerical competencies emerge from specialized yet partially reusable head circuits.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Evaluation of Low-Resource Machine Translation: A Reference-less Dialect Guided Approach with a Refined Sylheti-English Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) for low-resource languages poses a persistent challenge, primarily due to the limited availability of high quality reference translations. This issue is further exacerbated in languages with multiple dialects, where linguistic diversity and data scarcity hinder robust evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution through reference-free evaluation techniques; however, their effectiveness diminishes in the absence of dialect-specific context and tailored guidance. In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework that enhances LLM-based MT evaluation using a dialect guided approach. We extend the ONUBAD dataset by incorporating Sylheti-English sentence pairs, corresponding machine translations, and Direct Assessment (DA) scores annotated by native speakers. To address the vocabulary gap, we augment the tokenizer vocabulary with dialect-specific terms. We further introduce a regression head to enable scalar score prediction and design a dialect-guided (DG) prompting strategy. Our evaluation across multiple LLMs shows that the proposed pipeline consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest gain of +0.1083 in Spearman correlation, along with improvements across other evaluation settings. The dataset and the code are available at https://github.com/180041123-Atiq/MTEonLowResourceLanguage.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across various domains, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt injections. While most existing research on jailbreak attacks and hallucination phenomena has focused primarily on open-source models, we investigate the frontier of closed-source LLMs under multilingual attack scenarios. We present a first-of-its-kind integrated adversarial framework that leverages diverse attack techniques to systematically evaluate frontier proprietary solutions, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Qwen-Max. Our evaluation spans six categories of security contents in both English and Chinese, generating 38,400 responses across 32 types of jailbreak attacks. Attack success rate (ASR) is utilized as the quantitative metric to assess performance from three dimensions: prompt design, model architecture, and language environment. Our findings suggest that Qwen-Max is the most vulnerable, while GPT-4o shows the strongest defense. Notably, prompts in Chinese consistently yield higher ASRs than their English counterparts, and our novel Two-Sides attack technique proves to be the most effective across all models. This work highlights a dire need for language-aware alignment and robust cross-lingual defenses in LLMs, and we hope it will inspire researchers, developers, and policymakers toward more robust and inclusive AI systems.</description>

      <title>Enhance Mobile Agents Thinking Process Via Iterative Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chain of Action-Planning Thoughts (CoaT) paradigm has been shown to improve the reasoning performance of VLM-based mobile agents in GUI tasks. However, the scarcity of diverse CoaT trajectories limits the expressiveness and generalization ability of such agents. While self-training is commonly employed to address data scarcity, existing approaches either overlook the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps or depend on expensive process-level annotations to construct process reward models (PRM). To address the above problems, we propose an Iterative Preference Learning (IPL) that constructs a CoaT-tree through interative sampling, scores leaf nodes using rule-based reward, and backpropagates feedback to derive Thinking-level Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) pairs. To prevent overfitting during warm-up supervised fine-tuning, we further introduce a three-stage instruction evolution, which leverages GPT-4o to generate diverse Q\&amp;A pairs based on real mobile UI screenshots, enhancing both generality and layout understanding. Experiments on three standard Mobile GUI-agent benchmarks demonstrate that our agent MobileIPL outperforms strong baselines, including continual pretraining models such as OS-ATLAS and UI-TARS. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across three standard Mobile GUI-Agents benchmarks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain scenarios.</description>

      <title>HBO: Hierarchical Balancing Optimization for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on a mixture of diverse datasets poses challenges due to data imbalance and heterogeneity. Existing methods often address these issues across datasets (globally) but overlook the imbalance and heterogeneity within individual datasets (locally), which limits their effectiveness. We introduce Hierarchical Balancing Optimization (HBO), a novel method that enables LLMs to autonomously adjust data allocation during fine-tuning both across datasets (globally) and within each individual dataset (locally). HBO employs a bilevel optimization strategy with two types of actors: a Global Actor, which balances data sampling across different subsets of the training mixture, and several Local Actors, which optimizes data usage within each subset based on difficulty levels. These actors are guided by reward functions derived from the LLM's training state, which measure learning progress and relative performance improvement. We evaluate HBO on three LLM backbones across nine diverse tasks in multilingual and multitask setups. Results show that HBO consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving significant accuracy gains. Our in-depth analysis further demonstrates that both the global actor and local actors of HBO effectively adjust data usage during fine-tuning. HBO provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of data imbalance and heterogeneity in LLM fine-tuning, enabling more effective training across diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional LMs are Better Knowledge Memorizers? A Benchmark for Real-world Knowledge Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs), their knowledge memorization capabilities remain underexplored, due to the lack of standardized and high-quality test ground. In this paper, we introduce a novel, real-world and large-scale knowledge injection benchmark that evolves continuously over time without requiring human intervention. Specifically, we propose WikiDYK, which leverages recently-added and human-written facts from Wikipedia's "Did You Know..." entries. These entries are carefully selected by expert Wikipedia editors based on criteria such as verifiability and clarity. Each entry is converted into multiple question-answer pairs spanning diverse task formats from easy cloze prompts to complex multi-hop questions. WikiDYK contains 12,290 facts and 77,180 questions, which is also seamlessly extensible with future updates from Wikipedia editors. Extensive experiments using continued pre-training reveal a surprising insight: despite their prevalence in modern LLMs, Causal Language Models (CLMs) demonstrate significantly weaker knowledge memorization capabilities compared to Bidirectional Language Models (BiLMs), exhibiting a 23% lower accuracy in terms of reliability. To compensate for the smaller scales of current BiLMs, we introduce a modular collaborative framework utilizing ensembles of BiLMs as external knowledge repositories to integrate with LLMs. Experiment shows that our framework further improves the reliability accuracy by up to 29.1%.</description>

      <title>ExpertSteer: Intervening in LLMs through Expert Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet guiding them to follow desired behaviours during inference remains a significant challenge. Activation steering offers a promising method to control the generation process of LLMs by modifying their internal activations. However, existing methods commonly intervene in the model's behaviour using steering vectors generated by the model itself, which constrains their effectiveness to that specific model and excludes the possibility of leveraging powerful external expert models for steering. To address these limitations, we propose ExpertSteer, a novel approach that leverages arbitrary specialized expert models to generate steering vectors, enabling intervention in any LLMs. ExpertSteer transfers the knowledge from an expert model to a target LLM through a cohesive four-step process: first aligning representation dimensions with auto-encoders to enable cross-model transfer, then identifying intervention layer pairs based on mutual information analysis, next generating steering vectors from the expert model using Recursive Feature Machines, and finally applying these vectors on the identified layers during inference to selectively guide the target LLM without updating model parameters. We conduct comprehensive experiments using three LLMs on 15 popular benchmarks across four distinct domains. Experiments demonstrate that ExpertSteer significantly outperforms established baselines across diverse tasks at minimal cost.</description>

      <title>LLMSR@XLLM25: An Empirical Study of LLM for Structural Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Team asdfo123's submission to the LLMSR@XLLM25 shared task, which evaluates large language models on producing fine-grained, controllable, and interpretable reasoning processes. Systems must extract all problem conditions, decompose a chain of thought into statement-evidence pairs, and verify the logical validity of each pair. Leveraging only the off-the-shelf Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, we craft a concise few-shot, multi-turn prompt that first enumerates all conditions and then guides the model to label, cite, and adjudicate every reasoning step. A lightweight post-processor based on regular expressions normalises spans and enforces the official JSON schema. Without fine-tuning, external retrieval, or ensembling, our method ranks 5th overall, achieving macro F1 scores on par with substantially more complex and resource-consuming pipelines. We conclude by analysing the strengths and limitations of our approach and outlining directions for future research in structural reasoning with LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/asdfo123/LLMSR-asdfo123.</description>

      <title>UniEdit: A Unified Knowledge Editing Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model editing aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) by efficiently adjusting their internal parameters. Currently, most LLM editing datasets are confined to narrow knowledge domains and cover a limited range of editing evaluation. They often overlook the broad scope of editing demands and the diversity of ripple effects resulting from edits. In this context, we introduce UniEdit, a unified benchmark for LLM editing grounded in open-domain knowledge. First, we construct editing samples by selecting entities from 25 common domains across five major categories, utilizing the extensive triple knowledge available in open-domain knowledge graphs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domains. To address the issues of generality and locality in editing, we design an Neighborhood Multi-hop Chain Sampling (NMCS) algorithm to sample subgraphs based on a given knowledge piece to entail comprehensive ripple effects to evaluate. Finally, we employ proprietary LLMs to convert the sampled knowledge subgraphs into natural language text, guaranteeing grammatical accuracy and syntactical diversity. Extensive statistical analysis confirms the scale, comprehensiveness, and diversity of our UniEdit benchmark. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple LLMs and editors, analyzing their performance to highlight strengths and weaknesses in editing across open knowledge domains and various evaluation criteria, thereby offering valuable insights for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Wisdom from Diversity: Bias Mitigation Through Hybrid Human-LLM Crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their performance, large language models (LLMs) can inadvertently perpetuate biases found in the data they are trained on. By analyzing LLM responses to bias-eliciting headlines, we find that these models often mirror human biases. To address this, we explore crowd-based strategies for mitigating bias through response aggregation. We first demonstrate that simply averaging responses from multiple LLMs, intended to leverage the "wisdom of the crowd", can exacerbate existing biases due to the limited diversity within LLM crowds. In contrast, we show that locally weighted aggregation methods more effectively leverage the wisdom of the LLM crowd, achieving both bias mitigation and improved accuracy. Finally, recognizing the complementary strengths of LLMs (accuracy) and humans (diversity), we demonstrate that hybrid crowds containing both significantly enhance performance and further reduce biases across ethnic and gender-related contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt injection remains a major security risk for large language models. However, the efficacy of existing guardrail models in context-aware settings remains underexplored, as they often rely on static attack benchmarks. Additionally, they have over-defense tendencies. We introduce CAPTURE, a novel context-aware benchmark assessing both attack detection and over-defense tendencies with minimal in-domain examples. Our experiments reveal that current prompt injection guardrail models suffer from high false negatives in adversarial cases and excessive false positives in benign scenarios, highlighting critical limitations.</description>

      <title>From n-gram to Attention: How Model Architectures Learn and Propagate Bias in Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research on bias in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on data quality, with significantly less attention paid to model architecture and temporal influences of data. Even more critically, few studies systematically investigate the origins of bias. We propose a methodology grounded in comparative behavioral theory to interpret the complex interaction between training data and model architecture in bias propagation during language modeling. Building on recent work that relates transformers to n-gram LMs, we evaluate how data, model design choices, and temporal dynamics affect bias propagation. Our findings reveal that: (1) n-gram LMs are highly sensitive to context window size in bias propagation, while transformers demonstrate architectural robustness; (2) the temporal provenance of training data significantly affects bias; and (3) different model architectures respond differentially to controlled bias injection, with certain biases (e.g. sexual orientation) being disproportionately amplified. As language models become ubiquitous, our findings highlight the need for a holistic approach -- tracing bias to its origins across both data and model dimensions, not just symptoms, to mitigate harm.</description>

      <title>SLOT: Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions, leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models.

      <title>Traversal Verification for Speculative Tree Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a promising approach for accelerating large language models. The primary idea is to use a lightweight draft model to speculate the output of the target model for multiple subsequent timesteps, and then verify them in parallel to determine whether the drafted tokens should be accepted or rejected. To enhance acceptance rates, existing frameworks typically construct token trees containing multiple candidates in each timestep. However, their reliance on token-level verification mechanisms introduces two critical limitations: First, the probability distribution of a sequence differs from that of individual tokens, leading to suboptimal acceptance length. Second, current verification schemes begin from the root node and proceed layer by layer in a top-down manner. Once a parent node is rejected, all its child nodes should be discarded, resulting in inefficient utilization of speculative candidates. This paper introduces Traversal Verification, a novel speculative decoding algorithm that fundamentally rethinks the verification paradigm through leaf-to-root traversal. Our approach considers the acceptance of the entire token sequence from the current node to the root, and preserves potentially valid subsequences that would be prematurely discarded by existing methods. We theoretically prove that the probability distribution obtained through Traversal Verification is identical to that of the target model, guaranteeing lossless inference while achieving substantial acceleration gains. Experimental results across different large language models and multiple tasks show that our method consistently improves acceptance length and throughput over existing methods</description>

      <title>The power of text similarity in identifying AI-LLM paraphrased documents: The case of BBC news articles and ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI paraphrased text can be used for copyright infringement and the AI paraphrased content can deprive substantial revenue from original content creators. Despite this recent surge of malicious use of generative AI, there are few academic publications that research this threat. In this article, we demonstrate the ability of pattern-based similarity detection for AI paraphrased news recognition. We propose an algorithmic scheme, which is not limited to detect whether an article is an AI paraphrase, but, more importantly, to identify that the source of infringement is the ChatGPT. The proposed method is tested with a benchmark dataset specifically created for this task that incorporates real articles from BBC, incorporating a total of 2,224 articles across five different news categories, as well as 2,224 paraphrased articles created with ChatGPT. Results show that our pattern similarity-based method, that makes no use of deep learning, can detect ChatGPT assisted paraphrased articles at percentages 96.23% for accuracy, 96.25% for precision, 96.21% for sensitivity, 96.25% for specificity and 96.23% for F1 score.</description>

      <title>Table-R1: Region-based Reinforcement Learning for Table Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tables present unique challenges for language models due to their structured row-column interactions, necessitating specialized approaches for effective comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in table reasoning through prompting and techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT), optimizing their performance for table question answering remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce region-based Table-R1, a novel reinforcement learning approach that enhances LLM table understanding by integrating region evidence into reasoning steps. Our method employs Region-Enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (RE-SFT) to guide models in identifying relevant table regions before generating answers, incorporating textual, symbolic, and program-based reasoning. Additionally, Table-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (TARPO) introduces a mixed reward system to dynamically balance region accuracy and answer correctness, with decaying region rewards and consistency penalties to align reasoning steps. Experiments show that Table-R1 achieves an average performance improvement of 14.36 points across multiple base models on three benchmark datasets, even outperforming baseline models with ten times the parameters, while TARPO reduces response token consumption by 67.5% compared to GRPO, significantly advancing LLM capabilities in efficient tabular reasoning.</description>

      <title>PSC: Extending Context Window of Large Language Models via Phase Shift Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is an efficient position encoding approach and is widely utilized in numerous large language models (LLMs). Recently, a lot of methods have been put forward to further expand the context window based on RoPE. The core concept of those methods is to predefine or search for a set of factors to rescale the base frequencies of RoPE. Nevertheless, it is quite a challenge for existing methods to predefine an optimal factor due to the exponential search space. In view of this, we introduce PSC (Phase Shift Calibration), a small module for calibrating the frequencies predefined by existing methods. With the employment of PSC, we demonstrate that many existing methods can be further enhanced, like PI, YaRN, and LongRoPE. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks. The results demonstrate that (1) when PSC is enabled, the comparative reductions in perplexity increase as the context window size is varied from 16k, to 32k, and up to 64k. (2) Our approach is broadly applicable and exhibits robustness across a variety of models and tasks. The code can be found at https://github.com/WNQzhu/PSC.</description>

      <title>Learning to Play Like Humans: A Framework for LLM Adaptation in Interactive Fiction Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive Fiction games (IF games) are where players interact through natural language commands. While recent advances in Artificial Intelligence agents have reignited interest in IF games as a domain for studying decision-making, existing approaches prioritize task-specific performance metrics over human-like comprehension of narrative context and gameplay logic. This work presents a cognitively inspired framework that guides Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn and play IF games systematically. Our proposed **L**earning to **P**lay **L**ike **H**umans (LPLH) framework integrates three key components: (1) structured map building to capture spatial and narrative relationships, (2) action learning to identify context-appropriate commands, and (3) feedback-driven experience analysis to refine decision-making over time. By aligning LLMs-based agents' behavior with narrative intent and commonsense constraints, LPLH moves beyond purely exploratory strategies to deliver more interpretable, human-like performance. Crucially, this approach draws on cognitive science principles to more closely simulate how human players read, interpret, and respond within narrative worlds. As a result, LPLH reframes the IF games challenge as a learning problem for LLMs-based agents, offering a new path toward robust, context-aware gameplay in complex text-based environments.</description>

      <title>Introspective Growth: Automatically Advancing LLM Expertise in Technology Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly demonstrate signs of conceptual understanding, yet much of their internal knowledge remains latent, loosely structured, and difficult to access or evaluate. We propose self-questioning as a lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding, particularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic distinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark centers on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between closely related but substantively different inventions? We show that prompting LLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background knowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These self-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal knowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts further enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and lacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that chain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though self-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of technical concepts. Notably, we uncover an asymmetry in prompting: smaller models often generate more fundamental, more open-ended, better-aligned questions for mid-sized models than large models with better understanding do, revealing a new strategy for cross-model collaboration. Altogether, our findings establish self-questioning as both a practical mechanism for automatically improving LLM comprehension, especially in domains with sparse and underrepresented knowledge, and a diagnostic probe of how internal and external knowledge are organized.</description>

      <title>Towards DS-NER: Unveiling and Addressing Latent Noise in Distant Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distantly supervised named entity recognition (DS-NER) has emerged as a cheap and convenient alternative to traditional human annotation methods, enabling the automatic generation of training data by aligning text with external resources. Despite the many efforts in noise measurement methods, few works focus on the latent noise distribution between different distant annotation methods. In this work, we explore the effectiveness and robustness of DS-NER by two aspects: (1) distant annotation techniques, which encompasses both traditional rule-based methods and the innovative large language model supervision approach, and (2) noise assessment, for which we introduce a novel framework. This framework addresses the challenges by distinctly categorizing them into the unlabeled-entity problem (UEP) and the noisy-entity problem (NEP), subsequently providing specialized solutions for each. Our proposed method achieves significant improvements on eight real-world distant supervision datasets originating from three different data sources and involving four distinct annotation techniques, confirming its superiority over current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>What are they talking about? Benchmarking Large Language Models for Knowledge-Grounded Discussion Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of LLMs on a new task that requires combining discussion with background knowledge for summarization. This aims to address the limitation of outside observer confusion in existing dialogue summarization systems due to their reliance solely on discussion information. To achieve this, we model the task output as background and opinion summaries and define two standardized summarization patterns. To support assessment, we introduce the first benchmark comprising high-quality samples consistently annotated by human experts and propose a novel hierarchical evaluation framework with fine-grained, interpretable metrics. We evaluate 12 LLMs under structured-prompt and self-reflection paradigms. Our findings reveal: (1) LLMs struggle with background summary retrieval, generation, and opinion summary integration. (2) Even top LLMs achieve less than 69% average performance across both patterns. (3) Current LLMs lack adequate self-evaluation and self-correction capabilities for this task.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Models with Reward-guided Tree Search for Knowledge Graph Question and Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) tasks, which aim to find answers based on knowledge graphs (KGs) for natural language questions. Existing LLMs-based KGQA methods typically follow the Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) paradigm, which first retrieves reasoning paths from the large KGs, and then generates the answers based on them. However, these methods emphasize the exploration of new optimal reasoning paths in KGs while ignoring the exploitation of historical reasoning paths, which may lead to sub-optimal reasoning paths. Additionally, the complex semantics contained in questions may lead to the retrieval of inaccurate reasoning paths. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel and training-free framework for KGQA tasks called Reward-guided Tree Search on Graph (RTSoG). RTSoG decomposes an original question into a series of simpler and well-defined sub-questions to handle the complex semantics. Then, a Self-Critic Monte Carlo Tree Search (SC-MCTS) guided by a reward model is introduced to iteratively retrieve weighted reasoning paths as contextual knowledge. Finally, it stacks the weighted reasoning paths according to their weights to generate the final answers. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RTSoG. Notably, it achieves 8.7\% and 7.0\% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the GrailQA and the WebQSP respectively.</description>

      <title>KG-QAGen: A Knowledge-Graph-Based Framework for Systematic Question Generation and Long-Context LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing context length of modern language models has created a need for evaluating their ability to retrieve and process information across extensive documents. While existing benchmarks test long-context capabilities, they often lack a structured way to systematically vary question complexity. We introduce KG-QAGen (Knowledge-Graph-based Question-Answer Generation), a framework that (1) extracts QA pairs at multiple complexity levels (2) by leveraging structured representations of financial agreements (3) along three key dimensions -- multi-hop retrieval, set operations, and answer plurality -- enabling fine-grained assessment of model performance across controlled difficulty levels. Using this framework, we construct a dataset of 20,139 QA pairs (the largest number among the long-context benchmarks) and open-source a part of it. We evaluate 13 proprietary and open-source LLMs and observe that even the best-performing models are struggling with set-based comparisons and multi-hop logical inference. Our analysis reveals systematic failure modes tied to semantic misinterpretation and inability to handle implicit relations.</description>

      <title>LM$^2$otifs : An Explainable Framework for Machine-Generated Texts Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impressive ability of large language models to generate natural text across various tasks has led to critical challenges in authorship authentication. Although numerous detection methods have been developed to differentiate between machine-generated texts (MGT) and human-generated texts (HGT), the explainability of these methods remains a significant gap. Traditional explainability techniques often fall short in capturing the complex word relationships that distinguish HGT from MGT. To address this limitation, we present LM$^2$otifs, a novel explainable framework for MGT detection. Inspired by probabilistic graphical models, we provide a theoretical rationale for the effectiveness. LM$^2$otifs utilizes eXplainable Graph Neural Networks to achieve both accurate detection and interpretability. The LM$^2$otifs pipeline operates in three key stages: first, it transforms text into graphs based on word co-occurrence to represent lexical dependencies; second, graph neural networks are used for prediction; and third, a post-hoc explainability method extracts interpretable motifs, offering multi-level explanations from individual words to sentence structures. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the comparable performance of LM$^2$otifs. The empirical evaluation of the extracted explainable motifs confirms their effectiveness in differentiating HGT and MGT. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals distinct and visible linguistic fingerprints characteristic of MGT.</description>

      <title>DS-ProGen: A Dual-Structure Deep Language Model for Functional Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse Protein Folding (IPF) is a critical subtask in the field of protein design, aiming to engineer amino acid sequences capable of folding correctly into a specified three-dimensional (3D) conformation. Although substantial progress has been achieved in recent years, existing methods generally rely on either backbone coordinates or molecular surface features alone, which restricts their ability to fully capture the complex chemical and geometric constraints necessary for precise sequence prediction. To address this limitation, we present DS-ProGen, a dual-structure deep language model for functional protein design, which integrates both backbone geometry and surface-level representations. By incorporating backbone coordinates as well as surface chemical and geometric descriptors into a next-amino-acid prediction paradigm, DS-ProGen is able to generate functionally relevant and structurally stable sequences while satisfying both global and local conformational constraints. On the PRIDE dataset, DS-ProGen attains the current state-of-the-art recovery rate of 61.47%, demonstrating the synergistic advantage of multi-modal structural encoding in protein design. Furthermore, DS-ProGen excels in predicting interactions with a variety of biological partners, including ligands, ions, and RNA, confirming its robust functional retention capabilities.</description>

      <title>ESC-Judge: A Framework for Comparing Emotional Support Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly power mental-health chatbots, yet the field still lacks a scalable, theory-grounded way to decide which model is most effective to deploy. We present ESC-Judge, the first end-to-end evaluation framework that (i) grounds head-to-head comparisons of emotional-support LLMs in Clara Hill's established Exploration-Insight-Action counseling model, providing a structured and interpretable view of performance, and (ii) fully automates the evaluation pipeline at scale. ESC-Judge operates in three stages: first, it synthesizes realistic help-seeker roles by sampling empirically salient attributes such as stressors, personality, and life history; second, it has two candidate support agents conduct separate sessions with the same role, isolating model-specific strategies; and third, it asks a specialized judge LLM to express pairwise preferences across rubric-anchored skills that span the Exploration, Insight, and Action spectrum. In our study, ESC-Judge matched PhD-level annotators on 85 percent of Exploration, 83 percent of Insight, and 86 percent of Action decisions, demonstrating human-level reliability at a fraction of the cost. All code, prompts, synthetic roles, transcripts, and judgment scripts are released to promote transparent progress in emotionally supportive AI.</description>

      <title>Relation Extraction or Pattern Matching? Unravelling the Generalisation Limits of Language Models for Biographical RE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysing the generalisation capabilities of relation extraction (RE) models is crucial for assessing whether they learn robust relational patterns or rely on spurious correlations. Our cross-dataset experiments find that RE models struggle with unseen data, even within similar domains. Notably, higher intra-dataset performance does not indicate better transferability, instead often signaling overfitting to dataset-specific artefacts. Our results also show that data quality, rather than lexical similarity, is key to robust transfer, and the choice of optimal adaptation strategy depends on the quality of data available: while fine-tuning yields the best cross-dataset performance with high-quality data, few-shot in-context learning (ICL) is more effective with noisier data. However, even in these cases, zero-shot baselines occasionally outperform all cross-dataset results. Structural issues in RE benchmarks, such as single-relation per sample constraints and non-standardised negative class definitions, further hinder model transferability.</description>

      <title>Disambiguation in Conversational Question Answering in the Era of LLM: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambiguity remains a fundamental challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of human language. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing ambiguity has become even more critical due to their expanded capabilities and applications. In the context of Conversational Question Answering (CQA), this paper explores the definition, forms, and implications of ambiguity for language driven systems, particularly in the context of LLMs. We define key terms and concepts, categorize various disambiguation approaches enabled by LLMs, and provide a comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. We also explore publicly available datasets for benchmarking ambiguity detection and resolution techniques and highlight their relevance for ongoing research. Finally, we identify open problems and future research directions, proposing areas for further investigation. By offering a comprehensive review of current research on ambiguities and disambiguation with LLMs, we aim to contribute to the development of more robust and reliable language systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable and Interpretable Traffic Crash Pattern Prediction and Safety Interventions Using Customized Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting crash events is crucial for understanding crash distributions and their contributing factors, thereby enabling the design of proactive traffic safety policy interventions. However, existing methods struggle to interpret the complex interplay among various sources of traffic crash data, including numeric characteristics, textual reports, crash imagery, environmental conditions, and driver behavior records. As a result, they often fail to capture the rich semantic information and intricate interrelationships embedded in these diverse data sources, limiting their ability to identify critical crash risk factors. In this research, we propose TrafficSafe, a framework that adapts LLMs to reframe crash prediction and feature attribution as text-based reasoning. A multi-modal crash dataset including 58,903 real-world reports together with belonged infrastructure, environmental, driver, and vehicle information is collected and textualized into TrafficSafe Event Dataset. By customizing and fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset, the TrafficSafe LLM achieves a 42% average improvement in F1-score over baselines. To interpret these predictions and uncover contributing factors, we introduce TrafficSafe Attribution, a sentence-level feature attribution framework enabling conditional risk analysis. Findings show that alcohol-impaired driving is the leading factor in severe crashes, with aggressive and impairment-related behaviors having nearly twice the contribution for severe crashes compared to other driver behaviors. Furthermore, TrafficSafe Attribution highlights pivotal features during model training, guiding strategic crash data collection for iterative performance improvements. The proposed TrafficSafe offers a transformative leap in traffic safety research, providing a blueprint for translating advanced AI technologies into responsible, actionable, and life-saving outcomes.</description>

      <title>Extracting memorized pieces of (copyrighted) books from open-weight language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models (LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression. Drawing on adversarial ML and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we leverage a recent probabilistic extraction technique to extract pieces of the Books3 dataset from 13 open-weight LLMs. Through numerous experiments, we show that it's possible to extract substantial parts of at least some books from different LLMs. This is evidence that the LLMs have memorized the extracted text; this memorized content is copied inside the model parameters. But the results are complicated: the extent of memorization varies both by model and by book. With our specific experiments, we find that the largest LLMs don't memorize most books -- either in whole or in part. However, we also find that Llama 3.1 70B memorizes some books, like Harry Potter and 1984, almost entirely. We discuss why our results have significant implications for copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.</description>

      <title>The taggedPBC: Annotating a massive parallel corpus for crosslinguistic investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing datasets available for crosslinguistic investigations have tended to focus on large amounts of data for a small group of languages or a small amount of data for a large number of languages. This means that claims based on these datasets are limited in what they reveal about universal properties of the human language faculty. While this has begun to change through the efforts of projects seeking to develop tagged corpora for a large number of languages, such efforts are still constrained by limits on resources. The current paper reports on a large automatically tagged parallel dataset which has been developed to partially address this issue. The taggedPBC contains more than 1,800 sentences of pos-tagged parallel text data from over 1,500 languages, representing 133 language families and 111 isolates, dwarfing previously available resources. The accuracy of tags in this dataset is shown to correlate well with both existing SOTA taggers for high-resource languages (SpaCy, Trankit) as well as hand-tagged corpora (Universal Dependencies Treebanks). Additionally, a novel measure derived from this dataset, the N1 ratio, correlates with expert determinations of word order in three typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp) such that a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier trained on this feature can accurately identify basic word order for languages not in those databases. While much work is still needed to expand and develop this dataset, the taggedPBC is an important step to enable corpus-based crosslinguistic investigations, and is made available for research and collaboration via GitHub.</description>

      <title>Enriching Patent Claim Generation with European Patent Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drafting patent claims is time-intensive, costly, and requires professional skill. Therefore, researchers have investigated large language models (LLMs) to assist inventors in writing claims. However, existing work has largely relied on datasets from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). To enlarge research scope regarding various jurisdictions, drafting conventions, and legal standards, we introduce EPD, a European patent dataset. EPD presents rich textual data and structured metadata to support multiple patent-related tasks, including claim generation. This dataset enriches the field in three critical aspects: (1) Jurisdictional diversity: Patents from different offices vary in legal and drafting conventions. EPD fills a critical gap by providing a benchmark for European patents to enable more comprehensive evaluation. (2) Quality improvement: EPD offers high-quality granted patents with finalized and legally approved texts, whereas others consist of patent applications that are unexamined or provisional. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on EPD significantly outperform those trained on previous datasets and even GPT-4o in claim quality and cross-domain generalization. (3) Real-world simulation: We propose a difficult subset of EPD to better reflect real-world challenges of claim generation. Results reveal that all tested LLMs perform substantially worse on these challenging samples, which highlights the need for future research.</description>

      <title>Measuring Information Distortion in Hierarchical Ultra long Novel Generation:The Optimal Expansion Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Writing novels with Large Language Models (LLMs) raises a critical question: how much human-authored outline is necessary to generate high-quality million-word novels? While frameworks such as DOME, Plan&amp;Write, and Long Writer have improved stylistic coherence and logical consistency, they primarily target shorter novels (10k--100k words), leaving ultra-long generation largely unexplored. Drawing on insights from recent text compression methods like LLMZip and LLM2Vec, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis that quantifies distortion occurring when LLMs compress and reconstruct ultra-long novels under varying compression-expansion ratios. We introduce a hierarchical two-stage generation pipeline (outline -&gt; detailed outline -&gt; manuscript) and find an optimal outline length that balances information preservation with human effort. Through extensive experimentation with Chinese novels, we establish that a two-stage hierarchical outline approach significantly reduces semantic distortion compared to single-stage methods. Our findings provide empirically-grounded guidance for authors and researchers collaborating with LLMs to create million-word novels.</description>

      <title>Improving Multilingual Language Models by Aligning Representations through Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMS) process non-English tokens within their layer representations, an open question despite significant advancements in the field. Using representation steering, specifically by adding a learned vector to a single model layer's activations, we demonstrate that steering a single model layer can notably enhance performance. Our analysis shows that this approach achieves results comparable to translation baselines and surpasses state of the art prompt optimization methods. Additionally, we highlight how advanced techniques like supervised fine tuning (\textsc{sft}) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (\textsc{rlhf}) improve multilingual capabilities by altering representation spaces. We further illustrate how these methods align with our approach to reshaping LLMS layer representations.</description>

      <title>CMLFormer: A Dual Decoder Transformer with Switching Point Learning for Code-Mixed Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-mixed languages, characterized by frequent within-sentence language transitions, present structural challenges that standard language models fail to address. In this work, we propose CMLFormer, an enhanced multi-layer dual-decoder Transformer with a shared encoder and synchronized decoder cross-attention, designed to model the linguistic and semantic dynamics of code-mixed text. CMLFormer is pre-trained on an augmented Hinglish corpus with switching point and translation annotations with multiple new objectives specifically aimed at capturing switching behavior, cross-lingual structure, and code-mixing complexity. Our experiments show that CMLFormer improves F1 score, precision, and accuracy over other approaches on the HASOC-2021 benchmark under select pre-training setups. Attention analyses further show that it can identify and attend to switching points, validating its sensitivity to code-mixed structure. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CMLFormer's architecture and multi-task pre-training strategy for modeling code-mixed languages.</description>

      <title>PromptPrism: A Linguistically-Inspired Taxonomy for Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompts are the interface for eliciting the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Understanding their structure and components is critical for analyzing LLM behavior and optimizing performance. However, the field lacks a comprehensive framework for systematic prompt analysis and understanding. We introduce PromptPrism, a linguistically-inspired taxonomy that enables prompt analysis across three hierarchical levels: functional structure, semantic component, and syntactic pattern. We show the practical utility of PromptPrism by applying it to three applications: (1) a taxonomy-guided prompt refinement approach that automatically improves prompt quality and enhances model performance across a range of tasks; (2) a multi-dimensional dataset profiling method that extracts and aggregates structural, semantic, and syntactic characteristics from prompt datasets, enabling comprehensive analysis of prompt distributions and patterns; (3) a controlled experimental framework for prompt sensitivity analysis by quantifying the impact of semantic reordering and delimiter modifications on LLM performance. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our taxonomy across these applications, demonstrating that PromptPrism provides a foundation for refining, profiling, and analyzing prompts.</description>

      <title>AD-AGENT: A Multi-agent Framework for End-to-end Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in areas such as fraud detection, network monitoring, and scientific research. However, the diversity of data modalities and the increasing number of specialized AD libraries pose challenges for non-expert users who lack in-depth library-specific knowledge and advanced programming skills. To tackle this, we present AD-AGENT, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that turns natural-language instructions into fully executable AD pipelines. AD-AGENT coordinates specialized agents for intent parsing, data preparation, library and model selection, documentation mining, and iterative code generation and debugging. Using a shared short-term workspace and a long-term cache, the agents integrate popular AD libraries like PyOD, PyGOD, and TSLib into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that AD-AGENT produces reliable scripts and recommends competitive models across libraries. The system is open-sourced to support further research and practical applications in AD.</description>

      <title>Duluth at SemEval-2025 Task 7: TF-IDF with Optimized Vector Dimensions for Multilingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Duluth approach to the SemEval-2025 Task 7 on Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval. We implemented a TF-IDF-based retrieval system with experimentation on vector dimensions and tokenization strategies. Our best-performing configuration used word-level tokenization with a vocabulary size of 15,000 features, achieving an average success@10 score of 0.78 on the development set and 0.69 on the test set across ten languages. Our system showed stronger performance on higher-resource languages but still lagged significantly behind the top-ranked system, which achieved 0.96 average success@10. Our findings suggest that though advanced neural architectures are increasingly dominant in multilingual retrieval tasks, properly optimized traditional methods like TF-IDF remain competitive baselines, especially in limited compute resource scenarios.</description>

      <title>Think Before You Attribute: Improving the Performance of LLMs Attribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various science domains, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by a critical challenge: the lack of trustworthy, verifiable outputs. Current LLMs often generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes settings, where traceability and accountability are non-negotiable. To be reliable, attribution systems need high accuracy and retrieve data with short lengths, i.e., attribute to a sentence within a document rather than a whole document. We propose a sentence-level pre-attribution step for Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that classify sentences into three categories: not attributable, attributable to a single quote, and attributable to multiple quotes. By separating sentences before attribution, a proper attribution method can be selected for the type of sentence, or the attribution can be skipped altogether. Our results indicate that classifiers are well-suited for this task. In this work, we propose a pre-attribution step to reduce the computational complexity of attribution, provide a clean version of the HAGRID dataset, and provide an end-to-end attribution system that works out of the box.</description>

      <title>R1dacted: Investigating Local Censorship in DeepSeek's R1 Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DeepSeek recently released R1, a high-performing large language model (LLM) optimized for reasoning tasks. Despite its efficient training pipeline, R1 achieves competitive performance, even surpassing leading reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 on several benchmarks. However, emerging reports suggest that R1 refuses to answer certain prompts related to politically sensitive topics in China. While existing LLMs often implement safeguards to avoid generating harmful or offensive outputs, R1 represents a notable shift - exhibiting censorship-like behavior on politically charged queries. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by first introducing a large-scale set of heavily curated prompts that get censored by R1, covering a range of politically sensitive topics, but are not censored by other models. We then conduct a comprehensive analysis of R1's censorship patterns, examining their consistency, triggers, and variations across topics, prompt phrasing, and context. Beyond English-language queries, we explore censorship behavior in other languages. We also investigate the transferability of censorship to models distilled from the R1 language model. Finally, we propose techniques for bypassing or removing this censorship. Our findings reveal possible additional censorship integration likely shaped by design choices during training or alignment, raising concerns about transparency, bias, and governance in language model deployment.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Deceptiveness of Knowledge Editing: A Mechanistic Analysis of Superficial Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing, which aims to update the knowledge encoded in language models, can be deceptive. Despite the fact that many existing knowledge editing algorithms achieve near-perfect performance on conventional metrics, the models edited by them are still prone to generating original knowledge. This paper introduces the concept of "superficial editing" to describe this phenomenon. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that this issue presents a significant challenge to existing algorithms. Through systematic investigation, we identify and validate two key factors contributing to this issue: (1) the residual stream at the last subject position in earlier layers and (2) specific attention modules in later layers. Notably, certain attention heads in later layers, along with specific left singular vectors in their output matrices, encapsulate the original knowledge and exhibit a causal relationship with superficial editing. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the task of superficial unlearning, where we observe consistent patterns in the behavior of specific attention heads and their corresponding left singular vectors, thereby demonstrating the robustness and broader applicability of our methodology and conclusions. Our code is available here.</description>

      <title>Predicting Turn-Taking and Backchannel in Human-Machine Conversations Using Linguistic, Acoustic, and Visual Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the gap in predicting turn-taking and backchannel actions in human-machine conversations using multi-modal signals (linguistic, acoustic, and visual). To overcome the limitation of existing datasets, we propose an automatic data collection pipeline that allows us to collect and annotate over 210 hours of human conversation videos. From this, we construct a Multi-Modal Face-to-Face (MM-F2F) human conversation dataset, including over 1.5M words and corresponding turn-taking and backchannel annotations from approximately 20M frames. Additionally, we present an end-to-end framework that predicts the probability of turn-taking and backchannel actions from multi-modal signals. The proposed model emphasizes the interrelation between modalities and supports any combination of text, audio, and video inputs, making it adaptable to a variety of realistic scenarios. Our experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on turn-taking and backchannel prediction tasks, achieving a 10\% increase in F1-score on turn-taking and a 33\% increase on backchannel prediction. Our dataset and code are publicly available online to ease of subsequent research.</description>

      <title>Know3-RAG: A Knowledge-aware RAG Framework with Adaptive Retrieval, Generation, and Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to impressive progress in natural language generation, yet their tendency to produce hallucinated or unsubstantiated content remains a critical concern. To improve factual reliability, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge during inference. However, existing RAG systems face two major limitations: (1) unreliable adaptive control due to limited external knowledge supervision, and (2) hallucinations caused by inaccurate or irrelevant references. To address these issues, we propose Know3-RAG, a knowledge-aware RAG framework that leverages structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs) to guide three core stages of the RAG process, including retrieval, generation, and filtering. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge-aware adaptive retrieval module that employs KG embedding to assess the confidence of the generated answer and determine retrieval necessity, a knowledge-enhanced reference generation strategy that enriches queries with KG-derived entities to improve generated reference relevance, and a knowledge-driven reference filtering mechanism that ensures semantic alignment and factual accuracy of references. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that Know3-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines, significantly reducing hallucinations and enhancing answer reliability.</description>

      <title>Shadow-FT: Tuning Instruct via Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) consistently benefit from further fine-tuning on various tasks. However, we observe that directly tuning the INSTRUCT (i.e., instruction tuned) models often leads to marginal improvements and even performance degeneration. Notably, paired BASE models, the foundation for these INSTRUCT variants, contain highly similar weight values (i.e., less than 2% on average for Llama 3.1 8B). Therefore, we propose a novel Shadow-FT framework to tune the INSTRUCT models by leveraging the corresponding BASE models. The key insight is to fine-tune the BASE model, and then directly graft the learned weight updates to the INSTRUCT model. Our proposed Shadow-FT introduces no additional parameters, is easy to implement, and significantly improves performance. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning mainstream LLMs, such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3 series, and evaluate them across 19 benchmarks covering coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Shadow-FT consistently outperforms conventional full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning approaches. Further analyses indicate that Shadow-FT can be applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and combined with direct preference optimization (DPO). Codes and weights are available at \href{https://github.com/wutaiqiang/Shadow-FT}{Github}.</description>

      <title>ToTRL: Unlock LLM Tree-of-Thoughts Reasoning Potential through Puzzles Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, which can be elicited by reinforcement learning (RL). However, prolonged CoT reasoning presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection. The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction. In contrast, tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure. This reasoning structure facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of unproductive paths. This process can potentially lead to improved performance and reduced token costs. Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a rule-based reward. ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy. Furthermore, we employ LLMs as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process. Solving puzzle games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning capability. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our ToTQwen3-8B model, trained with our ToTRL, achieves significant improvement in performance and reasoning efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.</description>

However, biases embedded in AI-generated content--such as gender, racial, or national stereotypes--raise significant ethical and educational concerns. Despite the growing use of GenAI, systematic methods for detecting and evaluating such biases in educational materials remain limited. This study proposes an automated bias assessment approach that integrates the Contextualized Embedding Association Test with a prompt-engineered word extraction method within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. We applied this method to AI-generated texts used in tutor training lessons. Results show a high alignment between the automated and manually curated word sets, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.993, indicating reliable and consistent bias assessment. Our method reduces human subjectivity and enhances fairness, scalability, and reproducibility in auditing GenAI-produced educational content.</description>

      <title>On-Policy Optimization with Group Equivalent Preference for Multi-Programming Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.</description>

      <title>What is Stigma Attributed to? A Theory-Grounded, Expert-Annotated Interview Corpus for Demystifying Mental-Health Stigma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental-health stigma remains a pervasive social problem that hampers treatment-seeking and recovery. Existing resources for training neural models to finely classify such stigma are limited, relying primarily on social-media or synthetic data without theoretical underpinnings. To remedy this gap, we present an expert-annotated, theory-informed corpus of human-chatbot interviews, comprising 4,141 snippets from 684 participants with documented socio-cultural backgrounds. Our experiments benchmark state-of-the-art neural models and empirically unpack the challenges of stigma detection. This dataset can facilitate research on computationally detecting, neutralizing, and counteracting mental-health stigma.</description>

      <title>ReEx-SQL: Reasoning with Execution-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Text-to-SQL, execution feedback is essential for guiding large language models (LLMs) to reason accurately and generate reliable SQL queries. However, existing methods treat execution feedback solely as a post-hoc signal for correction or selection, failing to integrate it into the generation process. This limitation hinders their ability to address reasoning errors as they occur, ultimately reducing query accuracy and robustness. To address this issue, we propose ReEx-SQL (Reasoning with Execution-Aware Reinforcement Learning), a framework for Text-to-SQL that enables models to interact with the database during decoding and dynamically adjust their reasoning based on execution feedback. ReEx-SQL introduces an execution-aware reasoning paradigm that interleaves intermediate SQL execution into reasoning paths, facilitating context-sensitive revisions. It achieves this through structured prompts with markup tags and a stepwise rollout strategy that integrates execution feedback into each stage of generation. To supervise policy learning, we develop a composite reward function that includes an exploration reward, explicitly encouraging effective database interaction. Additionally, ReEx-SQL adopts a tree-based decoding strategy to support exploratory reasoning, enabling dynamic expansion of alternative reasoning paths. Notably, ReEx-SQL achieves 88.8% on Spider and 64.9% on BIRD at the 7B scale, surpassing the standard reasoning baseline by 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively. It also shows robustness, achieving 85.2% on Spider-Realistic with leading performance. In addition, its tree-structured decoding improves efficiency and performance over linear decoding, reducing inference time by 51.9% on the BIRD development set.</description>

      <title>A Token is Worth over 1,000 Tokens: Efficient Knowledge Distillation through Low-Rank Clone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training high-performing Small Language Models (SLMs) remains costly, even with knowledge distillation and pruning from larger teacher models. Existing work often faces three key challenges: (1) information loss from hard pruning, (2) inefficient alignment of representations, and (3) underutilization of informative activations, particularly from Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). To address these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient pre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence with strong teacher models. LRC trains a set of low-rank projection matrices that jointly enable soft pruning by compressing teacher weights, and activation clone by aligning student activations, including FFN signals, with those of the teacher. This unified design maximizes knowledge transfer while removing the need for explicit alignment modules. Extensive experiments with open-source teachers (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct) show that LRC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models trained on trillions of tokens--while using only 20B tokens, achieving over 1,000x training efficiency. Our codes and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/CURRENTF/LowRankClone and https://huggingface.co/collections/JitaiHao/low-rank-clone-lrc-6828389e96a93f1d4219dfaf.</description>

      <title>EAVIT: Efficient and Accurate Human Value Identification from Text data via LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various fields, including the identification and discovery of human values within text data. While traditional NLP models, such as BERT, have been employed for this task, their ability to represent textual data is significantly outperformed by emerging LLMs like GPTs. However, the performance of online LLMs often degrades when handling long contexts required for value identification, which also incurs substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose EAVIT, an efficient and accurate framework for human value identification that combines the strengths of both locally fine-tunable and online black-box LLMs. Our framework employs a value detector - a small, local language model - to generate initial value estimations. These estimations are then used to construct concise input prompts for online LLMs, enabling accurate final value identification. To train the value detector, we introduce explanation-based training and data generation techniques specifically tailored for value identification, alongside sampling strategies to optimize the brevity of LLM input prompts. Our approach effectively reduces the number of input tokens by up to 1/6 compared to directly querying online LLMs, while consistently outperforming traditional NLP methods and other LLM-based strategies.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Arena: Towards Democratic and Scalable Automatic Evaluation of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent explosion of large language models (LLMs), each with its own general or specialized strengths, makes scalable, reliable benchmarking more urgent than ever. Standard practices nowadays face fundamental trade-offs: closed-ended question-based benchmarks (eg MMLU) struggle with saturation as newer models emerge, while crowd-sourced leaderboards (eg Chatbot Arena) rely on costly and slow human judges. Recently, automated methods (eg LLM-as-a-judge) shed light on the scalability, but risk bias by relying on one or a few "authority" models. To tackle these issues, we propose Decentralized Arena (dearena), a fully automated framework leveraging collective intelligence from all LLMs to evaluate each other. It mitigates single-model judge bias by democratic, pairwise evaluation, and remains efficient at scale through two key components: (1) a coarse-to-fine ranking algorithm for fast incremental insertion of new models with sub-quadratic complexity, and (2) an automatic question selection strategy for the construction of new evaluation dimensions. Across extensive experiments across 66 LLMs, dearena attains up to 97% correlation with human judgements, while significantly reducing the cost. Our code and data will be publicly released on https://github.com/maitrix-org/de-arena.</description>

      <title>PsyMem: Fine-grained psychological alignment and Explicit Memory Control for Advanced Role-Playing LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem, a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character. Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962 dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen, outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in human-likeness and character fidelity.</description>

      <title>SynDec: A Synthesize-then-Decode Approach for Arbitrary Textual Style Transfer via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as dominant forces for textual style transfer. However, for arbitrary style transfer, LLMs face two key challenges: (1) considerable reliance on manually-constructed prompts and (2) rigid stylistic biases inherent in LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel Synthesize-then-Decode (SynDec) approach, which automatically synthesizes high-quality prompts and amplifies their roles during decoding process. Specifically, our approach synthesizes prompts by selecting representative few-shot samples, conducting a four-dimensional style analysis, and reranking the candidates. At LLM decoding stage, the TST effect is amplified by maximizing the contrast in output probabilities between scenarios with and without the synthesized prompt, as well as between prompts and negative samples. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show that SynDec outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on five out of six benchmarks (e.g., achieving up to a 9\% increase in accuracy for modern-to-Elizabethan English transfer). Detailed ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of SynDec.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Prompting Enhances Sentence Embeddings in LLMs through Inference-Time Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a practical direction, as it requires neither additional data nor fine-tuning. Previous studies usually focus on prompt engineering to guide LLMs to encode the core semantic information of the sentence into the embedding of the last token. However, the last token in these methods still encodes an excess of non-essential information, such as stop words, limiting its encoding capacity. To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prompting (CP) method that introduces an extra auxiliary prompt to elicit better sentence embedding. By contrasting with the auxiliary prompt, CP can steer existing prompts to encode the core semantics of the sentence, rather than non-essential information. CP is a plug-and-play inference-time intervention method that can be combined with various prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our method can improve the performance of existing prompt-based methods across different LLMs. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zifengcheng/CP.</description>

      <title>FlightGPT: Towards Generalizable and Interpretable UAV Vision-and-Language Navigation with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is vital for applications such as disaster response, logistics delivery, and urban inspection. However, existing methods often struggle with insufficient multimodal fusion, weak generalization, and poor interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose FlightGPT, a novel UAV VLN framework built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with powerful multimodal perception capabilities. We design a two-stage training pipeline: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using high-quality demonstrations to improve initialization and structured reasoning; then, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, guided by a composite reward that considers goal accuracy, reasoning quality, and format compliance, to enhance generalization and adaptability. Furthermore, FlightGPT introduces a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning mechanism to improve decision interpretability. Extensive experiments on the city-scale dataset CityNav demonstrate that FlightGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across all scenarios, with a 9.22\% higher success rate than the strongest baseline in unseen environments. Our implementation is publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Structure -- Improving Legal Document Understanding Through Explicit Text Formatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal contracts possess an inherent, semantically vital structure (e.g., sections, clauses) that is crucial for human comprehension but whose impact on LLM processing remains under-explored. This paper investigates the effects of explicit input text structure and prompt engineering on the performance of GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 on a legal question-answering task using an excerpt of the CUAD. We compare model exact-match accuracy across various input formats: well-structured plain-text (human-generated from CUAD), plain-text cleaned of line breaks, extracted plain-text from Azure OCR, plain-text extracted by GPT-4o Vision, and extracted (and interpreted) Markdown (MD) from GPT-4o Vision. To give an indication of the impact of possible prompt engineering, we assess the impact of shifting task instructions to the system prompt and explicitly informing the model about the structured nature of the input. Our findings reveal that GPT-4o demonstrates considerable robustness to variations in input structure, but lacks in overall performance. Conversely, GPT-4.1's performance is markedly sensitive; poorly structured inputs yield suboptimal results (but identical with GPT-4o), while well-structured formats (original CUAD text, GPT-4o Vision text and GPT-4o MD) improve exact-match accuracy by ~20 percentage points. Optimizing the system prompt to include task details and an advisory about structured input further elevates GPT-4.1's accuracy by an additional ~10-13 percentage points, with Markdown ultimately achieving the highest performance under these conditions (79 percentage points overall exact-match accuracy). This research empirically demonstrates that while newer models exhibit greater resilience, careful input structuring and strategic prompt design remain critical for optimizing the performance of LLMs, and can significantly affect outcomes in high-stakes legal applications.</description>

      <title>Re-identification of De-identified Documents with Autoregressive Infilling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Documents revealing sensitive information about individuals must typically be de-identified. This de-identification is often done by masking all mentions of personally identifiable information (PII), thereby making it more difficult to uncover the identity of the person(s) in question. To investigate the robustness of de-identification methods, we present a novel, RAG-inspired approach that attempts the reverse process of re-identification based on a database of documents representing background knowledge. Given a text in which personal identifiers have been masked, the re-identification proceeds in two steps. A retriever first selects from the background knowledge passages deemed relevant for the re-identification. Those passages are then provided to an infilling model which seeks to infer the original content of each text span. This process is repeated until all masked spans are replaced. We evaluate the re-identification on three datasets (Wikipedia biographies, court rulings and clinical notes). Results show that (1) as many as 80% of de-identified text spans can be successfully recovered and (2) the re-identification accuracy increases along with the level of background knowledge.</description>

      <title>LEXam: Benchmarking Legal Reasoning on 340 Law Exams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. We introduce LEXam, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Adopting an LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. Project page: https://lexam-benchmark.github.io/</description>

      <title>GAP: Graph-Assisted Prompts for Dialogue-based Medication Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medication recommendations have become an important task in the healthcare domain, especially in measuring the accuracy and safety of medical dialogue systems (MDS). Different from the recommendation task based on electronic health records (EHRs), dialogue-based medication recommendations require research on the interaction details between patients and doctors, which is crucial but may not exist in EHRs. Recent advancements in large language models (LLM) have extended the medical dialogue domain. These LLMs can interpret patients' intent and provide medical suggestions including medication recommendations, but some challenges are still worth attention. During a multi-turn dialogue, LLMs may ignore the fine-grained medical information or connections across the dialogue turns, which is vital for providing accurate suggestions. Besides, LLMs may generate non-factual responses when there is a lack of domain-specific knowledge, which is more risky in the medical domain. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{P}rompts (\textbf{GAP}) framework for dialogue-based medication recommendation. It extracts medical concepts and corresponding states from dialogue to construct an explicitly patient-centric graph, which can describe the neglected but important information. Further, combined with external medical knowledge graphs, GAP can generate abundant queries and prompts, thus retrieving information from multiple sources to reduce the non-factual responses. We evaluate GAP on a dialogue-based medication recommendation dataset and further explore its potential in a more difficult scenario, dynamically diagnostic interviewing. Extensive experiments demonstrate its competitive performance when compared with strong baselines.</description>

      <title>On the Thinking-Language Modeling Gap in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System 2 reasoning is one of the defining characteristics of intelligence, which requires slow and logical thinking. Human conducts System 2 reasoning via the language of thoughts that organizes the reasoning process as a causal sequence of mental language, or thoughts. Recently, it has been observed that System 2 reasoning can be elicited from Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large-scale natural languages. However, in this work, we show that there is a significant gap between the modeling of languages and thoughts. As language is primarily a tool for humans to share knowledge and thinking, modeling human language can easily absorb language biases into LLMs deviated from the chain of thoughts in minds. Furthermore, we show that the biases will mislead the eliciting of "thoughts" in LLMs to focus only on a biased part of the premise. To this end, we propose a new prompt technique termed Language-of-Thoughts (LoT) to demonstrate and alleviate this gap. Instead of directly eliciting the chain of thoughts from partial information, LoT instructs LLMs to adjust the order and token used for the expressions of all the relevant information. We show that the simple strategy significantly reduces the language modeling biases in LLMs and improves the performance of LLMs across a variety of reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>PyFCG: Fluid Construction Grammar in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PyFCG, an open source software library that ports Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG) to the Python programming language. PyFCG enables its users to seamlessly integrate FCG functionality into Python programs, and to use FCG in combination with other libraries within Python's rich ecosystem. Apart from a general description of the library, this paper provides three walkthrough tutorials that demonstrate example usage of PyFCG in typical use cases of FCG: (i) formalising and testing construction grammar analyses, (ii) learning usage-based construction grammars from corpora, and (iii) implementing agent-based experiments on emergent communication.</description>

      <title>Do Not Let Low-Probability Tokens Over-Dominate in RL for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with recent innovations such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) demonstrating exceptional effectiveness. In this study, we identify a critical yet underexplored issue in RL training: low-probability tokens disproportionately influence model updates due to their large gradient magnitudes. This dominance hinders the effective learning of high-probability tokens, whose gradients are essential for LLMs' performance but are substantially suppressed. To mitigate this interference, we propose two novel methods: Advantage Reweighting and Low-Probability Token Isolation (Lopti), both of which effectively attenuate gradients from low-probability tokens while emphasizing parameter updates driven by high-probability tokens. Our approaches promote balanced updates across tokens with varying probabilities, thereby enhancing the efficiency of RL training. Experimental results demonstrate that they substantially improve the performance of GRPO-trained LLMs, achieving up to a 46.2% improvement in K&amp;K Logic Puzzle reasoning tasks. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/zhyang2226/AR-Lopti.</description>

      <title>A3 : an Analytical Low-Rank Approximation Framework for Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance; however, their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\tt A^\tt 3$, a post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\tt A^\tt 3$ splits a Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\tt QK$, $\tt OV$, and $\tt MLP$. For each component, $\tt A^\tt 3$ provides an analytical solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while minimizing the component's functional loss ($\it i.e.$, error in attention scores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces model sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime overheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the optimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward improved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that $\tt A^\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example, under the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank approximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2, outperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the versatility of $\tt A^\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and mixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance.</description>

      <title>Neural Morphological Tagging for Nguni Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphological parsing is the task of decomposing words into morphemes, the smallest units of meaning in a language, and labelling their grammatical roles. It is a particularly challenging task for agglutinative languages, such as the Nguni languages of South Africa, which construct words by concatenating multiple morphemes. A morphological parsing system can be framed as a pipeline with two separate components, a segmenter followed by a tagger. This paper investigates the use of neural methods to build morphological taggers for the four Nguni languages. We compare two classes of approaches: training neural sequence labellers (LSTMs and neural CRFs) from scratch and finetuning pretrained language models. We compare performance across these two categories, as well as to a traditional rule-based morphological parser. Neural taggers comfortably outperform the rule-based baseline and models trained from scratch tend to outperform pretrained models. We also compare parsing results across different upstream segmenters and with varying linguistic input features. Our findings confirm the viability of employing neural taggers based on pre-existing morphological segmenters for the Nguni languages.</description>

      <title>GuRE:Generative Query REwriter for Legal Passage Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal Passage Retrieval (LPR) systems are crucial as they help practitioners save time when drafting legal arguments. However, it remains an underexplored avenue. One primary reason is the significant vocabulary mismatch between the query and the target passage. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, the Generative query REwriter (GuRE). We leverage the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by training the LLM for query rewriting. "Rewritten queries" help retrievers to retrieve target passages by mitigating vocabulary mismatch. Experimental results show that GuRE significantly improves performance in a retriever-agnostic manner, outperforming all baseline methods. Further analysis reveals that different training objectives lead to distinct retrieval behaviors, making GuRE more suitable than direct retriever fine-tuning for real-world applications. Codes are avaiable at github.com/daehuikim/GuRE.</description>

      <title>MA-COIR: Leveraging Semantic Search Index and Generative Models for Ontology-Driven Biomedical Concept Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing biomedical concepts in the text is vital for ontology refinement, knowledge graph construction, and concept relationship discovery. However, traditional concept recognition methods, relying on explicit mention identification, often fail to capture complex concepts not explicitly stated in the text. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MA-COIR, a framework that reformulates concept recognition as an indexing-recognition task. By assigning semantic search indexes (ssIDs) to concepts, MA-COIR resolves ambiguities in ontology entries and enhances recognition efficiency. Using a pretrained BART-based model fine-tuned on small datasets, our approach reduces computational requirements to facilitate adoption by domain experts. Furthermore, we incorporate large language models (LLMs)-generated queries and synthetic data to improve recognition in low-resource settings. Experimental results on three scenarios (CDR, HPO, and HOIP) highlight the effectiveness of MA-COIR in recognizing both explicit and implicit concepts without the need for mention-level annotations during inference, advancing ontology-driven concept recognition in biomedical domain applications. Our code and constructed data are available at https://github.com/sl-633/macoir-master.</description>

      <title>Calm-Whisper: Reduce Whisper Hallucination On Non-Speech By Calming Crazy Heads Down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenAI's Whisper has achieved significant success in Automatic Speech Recognition. However, it has consistently been found to exhibit hallucination issues, particularly in non-speech segments, which limits its broader application in complex industrial settings.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel method to reduce Whisper's hallucination on non-speech segments without using any pre- or post-possessing techniques. Specifically, we benchmark the contribution of each self-attentional head in the Whisper-large-v3 decoder to the hallucination problem by performing a head-wise mask. Our findings reveal that only 3 of the 20 heads account for over 75% of the hallucinations on the UrbanSound dataset. We then fine-tune these three crazy heads using a collection of non-speech data. The results show that our best fine-tuned model, namely Calm-Whisper, achieves over 80% reduction in non-speech hallucination with only less than 0.1% WER degradation on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other.</description>

      <title>A Structured Literature Review on Traditional Approaches in Current Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continued rise of neural networks and large language models in the more recent past has altered the natural language processing landscape, enabling new approaches towards typical language tasks and achieving mainstream success. Despite the huge success of large language models, many disadvantages still remain and through this work we assess the state of the art in five application scenarios with a particular focus on the future perspectives and sensible application scenarios of traditional and older approaches and techniques.
  In this paper we survey recent publications in the application scenarios classification, information and relation extraction, text simplification as well as text summarization. After defining our terminology, i.e., which features are characteristic for traditional techniques in our interpretation for the five scenarios, we survey if such traditional approaches are still being used, and if so, in what way they are used. It turns out that all five application scenarios still exhibit traditional models in one way or another, as part of a processing pipeline, as a comparison/baseline to the core model of the respective paper, or as the main model(s) of the paper.

      <title>Fast, Not Fancy: Rethinking G2P with Rich Data and Rule-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homograph disambiguation remains a significant challenge in grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, especially for low-resource languages. This challenge is twofold: (1) creating balanced and comprehensive homograph datasets is labor-intensive and costly, and (2) specific disambiguation strategies introduce additional latency, making them unsuitable for real-time applications such as screen readers and other accessibility tools. In this paper, we address both issues. First, we propose a semi-automated pipeline for constructing homograph-focused datasets, introduce the HomoRich dataset generated through this pipeline, and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to enhance a state-of-the-art deep learning-based G2P system for Persian. Second, we advocate for a paradigm shift - utilizing rich offline datasets to inform the development of fast, rule-based methods suitable for latency-sensitive accessibility applications like screen readers. To this end, we improve one of the most well-known rule-based G2P systems, eSpeak, into a fast homograph-aware version, HomoFast eSpeak. Our results show an approximate 30% improvement in homograph disambiguation accuracy for the deep learning-based and eSpeak systems.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Many-to-Many Summarization with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-to-many summarization (M2MS) aims to process documents in any language and generate the corresponding summaries also in any language. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong multi-lingual abilities, giving them the potential to perform M2MS in real applications. This work presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs' M2MS ability. Specifically, we first reorganize M2MS data based on eight previous domain-specific datasets. The reorganized data contains 47.8K samples spanning five domains and six languages, which could be used to train and evaluate LLMs. Then, we benchmark 18 LLMs in a zero-shot manner and an instruction-tuning manner. Fine-tuned traditional models (e.g., mBART) are also conducted for comparisons. Our experiments reveal that, zero-shot LLMs achieve competitive results with fine-tuned traditional models. After instruct-tuning, open-source LLMs can significantly improve their M2MS ability, and outperform zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) in terms of automatic evaluations. In addition, we demonstrate that this task-specific improvement does not sacrifice the LLMs' general task-solving abilities. However, as revealed by our human evaluation, LLMs still face the factuality issue, and the instruction tuning might intensify the issue. Thus, how to control factual errors becomes the key when building LLM summarizers in real applications, and is worth noting in future research.</description>

      <title>ExTrans: Multilingual Deep Reasoning Translation via Exemplar-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, has shown impressive capabilities in complex problems, e.g., mathematics and coding. Some pioneering studies attempt to bring the success of LRMs in neural machine translation (MT). They try to build LRMs with deep reasoning MT ability via reinforcement learning (RL). Despite some progress that has been made, these attempts generally focus on several high-resource languages, e.g., English and Chinese, leaving the performance on other languages unclear. Besides, the reward modeling methods in previous work do not fully unleash the potential of reinforcement learning in MT. In this work, we first design a new reward modeling method that compares the translation results of the policy MT model with a strong LRM (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-671B), and quantifies the comparisons to provide rewards. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the reward modeling method. Using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the backbone, the trained model achieves the new state-of-the-art performance in literary translation, and outperforms strong LRMs including OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeeK-R1. Furthermore, we extend our method to the multilingual settings with 11 languages. With a carefully designed lightweight reward modeling in RL, we can simply transfer the strong MT ability from a single direction into multiple (i.e., 90) translation directions and achieve impressive multilingual MT performance.</description>

      <title>EffiBench-X: A Multi-Language Benchmark for Measuring Efficiency of LLM-Generated Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing code generation benchmarks primarily evaluate functional correctness, with limited focus on code efficiency and often restricted to a single language like Python. To address this gap, we introduce EffiBench-X, the first multi-language benchmark designed to measure the efficiency of LLM-generated code. EffiBench-X supports Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Golang. It comprises competitive programming tasks with human-expert solutions as efficiency baselines. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on EffiBench-X reveals that while models generate functionally correct code, they consistently underperform human experts in efficiency. Even the most efficient LLM-generated solutions (Qwen3-32B) achieve only around \textbf{62\%} of human efficiency on average, with significant language-specific variations. LLMs show better efficiency in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript than in Java, C++, and Golang. For instance, DeepSeek-R1's Python code is significantly more efficient than its Java code. These results highlight the critical need for research into LLM optimization techniques to improve code efficiency across diverse languages. The dataset and evaluation infrastructure are submitted and available at https://github.com/EffiBench/EffiBench-X.git and https://huggingface.co/datasets/EffiBench/effibench-x.</description>

Abstract: Airports from the top 20 in terms of annual passengers are highly dynamic environments with thousands of flights daily, and they aim to increase the degree of automation. To contribute to this, we implemented a Conversational AI system that enables staff in an airport to communicate with flight information systems. This system not only answers standard airport queries but also resolves airport terminology, jargon, abbreviations, and dynamic questions involving reasoning. In this paper, we built three different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, including traditional RAG, SQL RAG, and Knowledge Graph-based RAG (Graph RAG). Experiments showed that traditional RAG achieved 84.84% accuracy using BM25 + GPT-4 but occasionally produced hallucinations, which is risky to airport safety. In contrast, SQL RAG and Graph RAG achieved 80.85% and 91.49% accuracy respectively, with significantly fewer hallucinations. Moreover, Graph RAG was especially effective for questions that involved reasoning. Based on our observations, we thus recommend SQL RAG and Graph RAG are better for airport environments, due to fewer hallucinations and the ability to handle dynamic questions.</description>

      <title>To Bias or Not to Bias: Detecting bias in News with bias-detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Media bias detection is a critical task in ensuring fair and balanced information dissemination, yet it remains challenging due to the subjectivity of bias and the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this work, we perform sentence-level bias classification by fine-tuning a RoBERTa-based model on the expert-annotated BABE dataset. Using McNemar's test and the 5x2 cross-validation paired t-test, we show statistically significant improvements in performance when comparing our model to a domain-adaptively pre-trained DA-RoBERTa baseline. Furthermore, attention-based analysis shows that our model avoids common pitfalls like oversensitivity to politically charged terms and instead attends more meaningfully to contextually relevant tokens. For a comprehensive examination of media bias, we present a pipeline that combines our model with an already-existing bias-type classifier. Our method exhibits good generalization and interpretability, despite being constrained by sentence-level analysis and dataset size because of a lack of larger and more advanced bias corpora. We talk about context-aware modeling, bias neutralization, and advanced bias type classification as potential future directions. Our findings contribute to building more robust, explainable, and socially responsible NLP systems for media bias detection.</description>

      <title>topicwizard -- a Modern, Model-agnostic Framework for Topic Model Visualization and Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topic models are statistical tools that allow their users to gain qualitative and quantitative insights into the contents of textual corpora without the need for close reading. They can be applied in a wide range of settings from discourse analysis, through pretraining data curation, to text filtering. Topic models are typically parameter-rich, complex models, and interpreting these parameters can be challenging for their users. It is typical practice for users to interpret topics based on the top 10 highest ranking terms on a given topic. This list-of-words approach, however, gives users a limited and biased picture of the content of topics. Thoughtful user interface design and visualizations can help users gain a more complete and accurate understanding of topic models' output. While some visualization utilities do exist for topic models, these are typically limited to a certain type of topic model. We introduce topicwizard, a framework for model-agnostic topic model interpretation, that provides intuitive and interactive tools that help users examine the complex semantic relations between documents, words and topics learned by topic models.</description>

      <title>KIT's Offline Speech Translation and Instruction Following Submission for IWSLT 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scope of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) has recently broadened beyond traditional Speech Translation (ST) to encompass a wider array of tasks, including Speech Question Answering and Summarization. This shift is partly driven by the growing capabilities of modern systems, particularly with the success of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we present the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology's submissions for the Offline ST and Instruction Following (IF) tracks, where we leverage LLMs to enhance performance across all tasks. For the Offline ST track, we propose a pipeline that employs multiple automatic speech recognition systems, whose outputs are fused using an LLM with document-level context. This is followed by a two-step translation process, incorporating additional refinement step to improve translation quality. For the IF track, we develop an end-to-end model that integrates a speech encoder with an LLM to perform a wide range of instruction-following tasks. We complement it with a final document-level refinement stage to further enhance output quality by using contextual information.</description>

      <title>SNAPE-PM: Building and Utilizing Dynamic Partner Models for Adaptive Explanation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting to the addressee is crucial for successful explanations, yet poses significant challenges for dialogsystems. We adopt the approach of treating explanation generation as a non-stationary decision process, where the optimal strategy varies according to changing beliefs about the explainee and the interaction context. In this paper we address the questions of (1) how to track the interaction context and the relevant listener features in a formally defined computational partner model, and (2) how to utilize this model in the dynamically adjusted, rational decision process that determines the currently best explanation strategy. We propose a Bayesian inference-based approach to continuously update the partner model based on user feedback, and a non-stationary Markov Decision Process to adjust decision-making based on the partner model values. We evaluate an implementation of this framework with five simulated interlocutors, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to different partners with constant and even changing feedback behavior. The results show high adaptivity with distinct explanation strategies emerging for different partners, highlighting the potential of our approach to improve explainable AI systems and dialogsystems in general.</description>

      <title>Suicide Risk Assessment Using Multimodal Speech Features: A Study on the SW1 Challenge Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge conveys the need for speech-based suicide risk assessment in adolescents. This study investigates a multimodal approach for this challenge, integrating automatic transcription with WhisperX, linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa, and audio embeddings from WavLM. Additionally, handcrafted acoustic features -- including MFCCs, spectral contrast, and pitch-related statistics -- were incorporated. We explored three fusion strategies: early concatenation, modality-specific processing, and weighted attention with mixup regularization. Results show that weighted attention provided the best generalization, achieving 69% accuracy on the development set, though a performance gap between development and test sets highlights generalization challenges. Our findings, strictly tied to the MINI-KID framework, emphasize the importance of refining embedding representations and fusion mechanisms to enhance classification reliability.</description>

      <title>Advancing Sequential Numerical Prediction in Autoregressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive models have become the de facto choice for sequence generation tasks, but standard approaches treat digits as independent tokens and apply cross-entropy loss, overlooking the coherent structure of numerical sequences. This paper introduces Numerical Token Integrity Loss (NTIL) to address this gap. NTIL operates at two levels: (1) token-level, where it extends the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to preserve ordinal relationships between numerical values, and (2) sequence-level, where it penalizes the overall discrepancy between the predicted and actual sequences. This dual approach improves numerical prediction and integrates effectively with LLMs/MLLMs. Extensive experiments show significant performance improvements with NTIL.</description>

      <title>Systematic Generalization in Language Models Scales with Information Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic generalization remains challenging for current language models, which are known to be both sensitive to semantically similar permutations of the input and to struggle with known concepts presented in novel contexts. Although benchmarks exist for assessing compositional behavior, it is unclear how to measure the difficulty of a systematic generalization problem. In this work, we show how one aspect of systematic generalization can be described by the entropy of the distribution of component parts in the training data. We formalize a framework for measuring entropy in a sequence-to-sequence task and find that the performance of popular model architectures scales with the entropy. Our work connects systematic generalization to information efficiency, and our results indicate that success at high entropy can be achieved even without built-in priors, and that success at low entropy can serve as a target for assessing progress towards robust systematic generalization.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Language Diversity When Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior research diverges on language diversity in LLM fine-tuning: Some studies report benefits while others find no advantages. Through controlled fine-tuning experiments across 132 translation directions, we systematically resolve these disparities. We find that expanding language diversity during fine-tuning improves translation quality for both unsupervised and -- surprisingly -- supervised pairs, despite less diverse models being fine-tuned exclusively on these supervised pairs. However, benefits plateau or decrease beyond a certain diversity threshold. We show that increased language diversity creates more language-agnostic representations. These representational adaptations help explain the improved performance in models fine-tuned with greater diversity.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Confidence Evaluation of LALMs For Temporal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popular success of text-based large language models (LLM) has streamlined the attention of the multimodal community to combine other modalities like vision and audio along with text to achieve similar multimodal capabilities. In this quest, large audio language models (LALMs) have to be evaluated on reasoning related tasks which are different from traditional classification or generation tasks. Towards this goal, we propose a novel dataset called temporal reasoning evaluation of audio (TREA).
  We benchmark open-source LALMs and observe that they are consistently behind human capabilities on the tasks in the TREA dataset. While evaluating LALMs, we also propose an uncertainty metric, which computes the invariance of the model to semantically identical perturbations of the input. Our analysis shows that the accuracy and uncertainty metrics are not necessarily correlated and thus, points to a need for wholesome evaluation of LALMs for high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>ModernGBERT: German-only 1B Encoder Model Trained from Scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the prominence of decoder-only language models, encoders remain crucial for resource-constrained applications. We introduce ModernGBERT (134M, 1B), a fully transparent family of German encoder models trained from scratch, incorporating architectural innovations from ModernBERT. To evaluate the practical trade-offs of training encoders from scratch, we also present LL\"aMmlein2Vec (120M, 1B, 7B), a family of encoders derived from German decoder-only models via LLM2Vec. We benchmark all models on natural language understanding, text embedding, and long-context reasoning tasks, enabling a controlled comparison between dedicated encoders and converted decoders. Our results show that ModernGBERT 1B outperforms prior state-of-the-art German encoders as well as encoders adapted via LLM2Vec, with regard to performance and parameter-efficiency. All models, training data, checkpoints and code are publicly available, advancing the German NLP ecosystem with transparent, high-performance encoder models.</description>

      <title>Understanding Cross-Lingual Inconsistency in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are demonstrably capable of cross-lingual transfer, but can produce inconsistent output when prompted with the same queries written in different languages. To understand how language models are able to generalize knowledge from one language to the others, we apply the logit lens to interpret the implicit steps taken by LLMs to solve multilingual multi-choice reasoning questions. We find LLMs predict inconsistently and are less accurate because they rely on subspaces of individual languages, rather than working in a shared semantic space. While larger models are more multilingual, we show their hidden states are more likely to dissociate from the shared representation compared to smaller models, but are nevertheless more capable of retrieving knowledge embedded across different languages. Finally, we demonstrate that knowledge sharing can be modulated by steering the models' latent processing towards the shared semantic space. We find reinforcing utilization of the shared space improves the models' multilingual reasoning performance, as a result of more knowledge transfer from, and better output consistency with English.</description>

      <title>What if Deception Cannot be Detected? A Cross-Linguistic Study on the Limits of Deception Detection from Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can deception be detected solely from written text? Cues of deceptive communication are inherently subtle, even more so in text-only communication. Yet, prior studies have reported considerable success in automatic deception detection. We hypothesize that such findings are largely driven by artifacts introduced during data collection and do not generalize beyond specific datasets. We revisit this assumption by introducing a belief-based deception framework, which defines deception as a misalignment between an author's claims and true beliefs, irrespective of factual accuracy, allowing deception cues to be studied in isolation. Based on this framework, we construct three corpora, collectively referred to as DeFaBel, including a German-language corpus of deceptive and non-deceptive arguments and a multilingual version in German and English, each collected under varying conditions to account for belief change and enable cross-linguistic analysis. Using these corpora, we evaluate commonly reported linguistic cues of deception. Across all three DeFaBel variants, these cues show negligible, statistically insignificant correlations with deception labels, contrary to prior work that treats such cues as reliable indicators. We further benchmark against other English deception datasets following similar data collection protocols. While some show statistically significant correlations, effect sizes remain low and, critically, the set of predictive cues is inconsistent across datasets. We also evaluate deception detection using feature-based models, pretrained language models, and instruction-tuned large language models. While some models perform well on established deception datasets, they consistently perform near chance on DeFaBel. Our findings challenge the assumption that deception can be reliably inferred from linguistic cues and call for rethinking how deception is studied and modeled in NLP.</description>

      <title>Tianyi: A Traditional Chinese Medicine all-rounder language model and its Real-World Clinical Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural medicines, particularly Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are gaining global recognition for their therapeutic potential in addressing human symptoms and diseases. TCM, with its systematic theories and extensive practical experience, provides abundant resources for healthcare. However, the effective application of TCM requires precise syndrome diagnosis, determination of treatment principles, and prescription formulation, which demand decades of clinical expertise. Despite advancements in TCM-based decision systems, machine learning, and deep learning research, limitations in data and single-objective constraints hinder their practical application. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in complex tasks, but lack specialization in TCM and face significant challenges, such as too big model scale to deploy and issues with hallucination. To address these challenges, we introduce Tianyi with 7.6-billion-parameter LLM, a model scale proper and specifically designed for TCM, pre-trained and fine-tuned on diverse TCM corpora, including classical texts, expert treatises, clinical records, and knowledge graphs. Tianyi is designed to assimilate interconnected and systematic TCM knowledge through a progressive learning manner. Additionally, we establish TCMEval, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, to assess LLMs in TCM examinations, clinical tasks, domain-specific question-answering, and real-world trials. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the significant potential of Tianyi as an AI assistant in TCM clinical practice and research, bridging the gap between TCM knowledge and practical application.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a notable capacity for adopting personas and engaging in role-playing. However, evaluating this ability presents significant challenges, as human assessments are resource-intensive and automated evaluations can be biased. To address this, we introduce Role-Playing Eval (RPEval), a novel benchmark designed to assess LLM role-playing capabilities across four key dimensions: emotional understanding, decision-making, moral alignment, and in-character consistency. This article details the construction of RPEval and presents baseline evaluations. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/yelboudouri/RPEval</description>

      <title>Positional Fragility in LLMs: How Offset Effects Reshape Our Understanding of Memorization Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are known to memorize parts of their training data, posing risk of copyright violations. To systematically examine this risk, we pretrain language models (1B/3B/8B) from scratch on 83B tokens, mixing web-scale data with public domain books used to simulate copyrighted content at controlled frequencies at lengths at least ten times longer than prior work. We thereby identified the offset effect, a phenomenon characterized by two key findings: (1) verbatim memorization is most strongly triggered by short prefixes drawn from the beginning of the context window, with memorization decreasing counterintuitively as prefix length increases; and (2) a sharp decline in verbatim recall when prefix begins offset from the initial tokens of the context window. We attribute this to positional fragility: models rely disproportionately on the earliest tokens in their context window as retrieval anchors, making them sensitive to even slight shifts. We further observe that when the model fails to retrieve memorized content, it often produces degenerated text. Leveraging these findings, we show that shifting sensitive data deeper into the context window suppresses both extractable memorization and degeneration. Our results suggest that positional offset is a critical and previously overlooked axis for evaluating memorization risks, since prior work implicitly assumed uniformity by probing only from the beginning of training sequences.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of Cross-Lingual Zero-Shot Generalization for Classical Languages in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and languages. In this study, we focus on natural language understanding in three classical languages -- Sanskrit, Ancient Greek and Latin -- to investigate the factors affecting cross-lingual zero-shot generalization. First, we explore named entity recognition and machine translation into English. While LLMs perform equal to or better than fine-tuned baselines on out-of-domain data, smaller models often struggle, especially with niche or abstract entity types. In addition, we concentrate on Sanskrit by presenting a factoid question-answering (QA) dataset and show that incorporating context via retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly boosts performance. In contrast, we observe pronounced performance drops for smaller LLMs across these QA tasks. These results suggest model scale as an important factor influencing cross-lingual generalization. Assuming that models used such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 are not instruction fine-tuned on classical languages, our findings provide insights into how LLMs may generalize on these languages and their consequent utility in classical studies.</description>

      <title>ToolSpectrum : Towards Personalized Tool Utilization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While integrating external tools into large language models (LLMs) enhances their ability to access real-time information and domain-specific services, existing approaches focus narrowly on functional tool selection following user instructions, overlooking the context-aware personalization in tool selection. This oversight leads to suboptimal user satisfaction and inefficient tool utilization, particularly when overlapping toolsets require nuanced selection based on contextual factors. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolSpectrum, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in personalized tool utilization. Specifically, we formalize two key dimensions of personalization, user profile and environmental factors, and analyze their individual and synergistic impacts on tool utilization. Through extensive experiments on ToolSpectrum, we demonstrate that personalized tool utilization significantly improves user experience across diverse scenarios. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit the limited ability to reason jointly about user profiles and environmental factors, often prioritizing one dimension at the expense of the other. Our findings underscore the necessity of context-aware personalization in tool-augmented LLMs and reveal critical limitations for current models. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Chengziha0/ToolSpectrum.</description>

      <title>Efficient Speech Language Modeling via Energy Distance in Continuous Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.</description>

      <title>Alignment-Augmented Speculative Decoding with Alignment Sampling and Conditional Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have revealed the great potential of speculative decoding in accelerating the autoregressive generation process of large language models. The success of these methods relies on the alignment between draft candidates and the sampled outputs of the target model. Existing methods mainly achieve draft-target alignment with training-based methods, e.g., EAGLE, Medusa, involving considerable training costs. In this paper, we present a training-free alignment-augmented speculative decoding algorithm. We propose alignment sampling, which leverages output distribution obtained in the prefilling phase to provide more aligned draft candidates. To further benefit from high-quality but non-aligned draft candidates, we also introduce a simple yet effective flexible verification strategy. Through an adaptive probability threshold, our approach can improve generation accuracy while further improving inference efficiency. Experiments on 8 datasets (including question answering, summarization and code completion tasks) show that our approach increases the average generation score by 3.3 points for the LLaMA3 model. Our method achieves a mean acceptance length up to 2.39 and speed up generation by 2.23.</description>

      <title>Picturized and Recited with Dialects: A Multimodal Chinese Representation Framework for Sentiment Analysis of Classical Chinese Poetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Chinese poetry is a vital and enduring part of Chinese literature, conveying profound emotional resonance. Existing studies analyze sentiment based on textual meanings, overlooking the unique rhythmic and visual features inherent in poetry,especially since it is often recited and accompanied by Chinese paintings. In this work, we propose a dialect-enhanced multimodal framework for classical Chinese poetry sentiment analysis. We extract sentence-level audio features from the poetry and incorporate audio from multiple dialects,which may retain regional ancient Chinese phonetic features, enriching the phonetic representation. Additionally, we generate sentence-level visual features, and the multimodal features are fused with textual features enhanced by LLM translation through multimodal contrastive representation learning. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets, achieving at least 2.51% improvement in accuracy and 1.63% in macro F1. We open-source the code to facilitate research in this area and provide insights for general multimodal Chinese representation.</description>

      <title>SeedBench: A Multi-task Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Seed Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seed science is essential for modern agriculture, directly influencing crop yields and global food security. However, challenges such as interdisciplinary complexity and high costs with limited returns hinder progress, leading to a shortage of experts and insufficient technological support. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise across various fields, their application in seed science remains limited due to the scarcity of digital resources, complex gene-trait relationships, and the lack of standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce SeedBench -- the first multi-task benchmark specifically designed for seed science. Developed in collaboration with domain experts, SeedBench focuses on seed breeding and simulates key aspects of modern breeding processes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 26 leading LLMs, encompassing proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific fine-tuned models. Our findings not only highlight the substantial gaps between the power of LLMs and the real-world seed science problems, but also make a foundational step for research on LLMs for seed design.</description>

      <title>JNLP at SemEval-2025 Task 11: Cross-Lingual Multi-Label Emotion Detection Using Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of global digitalization, users from different countries increasingly rely on social media for information exchange. In this context, multilingual multi-label emotion detection has emerged as a critical research area. This study addresses SemEval-2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection. Our paper focuses on two sub-tracks of this task: (1) Track A: Multi-label emotion detection, and (2) Track B: Emotion intensity. To tackle multilingual challenges, we leverage pre-trained multilingual models and focus on two architectures: (1) a fine-tuned BERT-based classification model and (2) an instruction-tuned generative LLM. Additionally, we propose two methods for handling multi-label classification: the base method, which maps an input directly to all its corresponding emotion labels, and the pairwise method, which models the relationship between the input text and each emotion category individually. Experimental results demonstrate the strong generalization ability of our approach in multilingual emotion recognition. In Track A, our method achieved Top 4 performance across 10 languages, ranking 1st in Hindi. In Track B, our approach also secured Top 5 performance in 7 languages, highlighting its simplicity and effectiveness\footnote{Our code is available at https://github.com/yingjie7/mlingual_multilabel_emo_detection.</description>

      <title>Stronger Together: Unleashing the Social Impact of Hate Speech Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the internet has been both a blessing and a curse for once marginalised communities. When used well, the internet can be used to connect and establish communities crossing different intersections; however, it can also be used as a tool to alienate people and communities as well as perpetuate hate, misinformation, and disinformation especially on social media platforms. We propose steering hate speech research and researchers away from pre-existing computational solutions and consider social methods to inform social solutions to address this social problem. In a similar way linguistics research can inform language planning policy, linguists should apply what we know about language and society to mitigate some of the emergent risks and dangers of anti-social behaviour in digital spaces. We argue linguists and NLP researchers can play a principle role in unleashing the social impact potential of linguistics research working alongside communities, advocates, activists, and policymakers to enable equitable digital inclusion and to close the digital divide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-life textual planning tasks such as meeting scheduling have posed much challenge to LLMs especially when the complexity is high. While previous work primarily studied auto-regressive generation of plans with closed-source models, we systematically evaluate both closed- and open-source models, including those that scales output length with complexity during inference, in generating programs, which are executed to output the plan. We consider not only standard Python code, but also the code to a constraint satisfaction problem solver. Despite the algorithmic nature of the task, we show that programming often but not always outperforms planning. Our detailed error analysis also indicates a lack of robustness and efficiency in the generated code that hinders generalization.</description>

      <title>HeteroSpec: Leveraging Contextual Heterogeneity for Efficient Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive decoding, the standard approach for Large Language Model (LLM) inference, remains a significant bottleneck due to its sequential nature. While speculative decoding algorithms mitigate this inefficiency through parallel verification, they fail to exploit the inherent heterogeneity in linguistic complexity, a key factor leading to suboptimal resource allocation. We address this by proposing HeteroSpec, a heterogeneity-adaptive speculative decoding framework that dynamically optimizes computational resource allocation based on linguistic context complexity. HeteroSpec introduces two key mechanisms: (1) A novel cumulative meta-path Top-$K$ entropy metric for efficiently identifying predictable contexts. (2) A dynamic resource allocation strategy based on data-driven entropy partitioning, enabling adaptive speculative expansion and pruning tailored to local context difficulty. Evaluated on five public benchmarks and four models, HeteroSpec achieves an average speedup of 4.26$\times$. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE-3 across speedup rates, average acceptance length, and verification cost. Notably, HeteroSpec requires no draft model retraining, incurs minimal overhead, and is orthogonal to other acceleration techniques. It demonstrates enhanced acceleration with stronger draft models, establishing a new paradigm for context-aware LLM inference acceleration.</description>

      <title>WikiPersonas: What Can We Learn From Personalized Alignment to Famous People?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference alignment has become a standard pipeline in finetuning models to follow \emph{generic} human preferences. Majority of work seeks to optimize model to produce responses that would be preferable \emph{on average}, simplifying the diverse and often \emph{contradicting} space of human preferences. While research has increasingly focused on personalized alignment: adapting models to individual user preferences, there is a lack of personalized preference dataset which focus on nuanced individual-level preferences. To address this, we introduce WikiPersona: the first fine-grained personalization using well-documented, famous individuals. Our dataset challenges models to align with these personas through an interpretable process: generating verifiable textual descriptions of a persona's background and preferences in addition to alignment. We systematically evaluate different personalization approaches and find that as few-shot prompting with preferences and fine-tuning fail to simultaneously ensure effectiveness and efficiency, using \textit{inferred personal preferences} as prefixes enables effective personalization, especially in topics where preferences clash while leading to more equitable generalization across unseen personas.</description>

      <title>Effective and Transparent RAG: Adaptive-Reward Reinforcement Learning for Decision Traceability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive domains. However, although RAG achieved successes across distinct domains, there are still some unsolved challenges: 1) Effectiveness. Existing research mainly focuses on developing more powerful RAG retrievers, but how to enhance the generator's (LLM's) ability to utilize the retrieved information for reasoning and generation? 2) Transparency. Most RAG methods ignore which retrieved content actually contributes to the reasoning process, resulting in a lack of interpretability and visibility. To address this, we propose ARENA (Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent), a transparent RAG generator framework trained via reinforcement learning (RL) with our proposed rewards. Based on the structured generation and adaptive reward calculation, our RL-based training enables the model to identify key evidence, perform structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces. Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, abundant experiments with various RAG baselines demonstrate that our model achieves 10-30% improvements on all multi-hop QA datasets, which is comparable with the SOTA Commercially-developed LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1). Further analyses show that ARENA has strong flexibility to be adopted on new datasets without extra training. Our models and codes are publicly released.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vocal feedback (e.g., `mhm', `yeah', `okay') is an important component of spoken dialogue and is crucial to ensuring common ground in conversational systems. The exact meaning of such feedback is conveyed through both lexical and prosodic form. In this work, we investigate the perceived prosodic similarity of vocal feedback with the same lexical form, and to what extent existing speech representations reflect such similarities. A triadic comparison task with recruited participants is used to measure perceived similarity of feedback responses taken from two different datasets. We find that spectral and self-supervised speech representations encode prosody better than extracted pitch features, especially in the case of feedback from the same speaker. We also find that it is possible to further condense and align the representations to human perception through contrastive learning.</description>

      <title>CSC-SQL: Corrective Self-Consistency in Text-to-SQL via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in translating natural language questions about relational databases into SQL queries. In particular, test-time scaling techniques such as Self-Consistency and Self-Correction can enhance SQL generation accuracy by increasing computational effort during inference. However, these methods have notable limitations: Self-Consistency may select suboptimal outputs despite majority votes, while Self-Correction typically addresses only syntactic errors. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose CSC-SQL, a novel method that integrates Self-Consistency and Self-Correction. CSC-SQL selects the two most frequently occurring outputs from parallel sampling and feeds them into a merge revision model for correction. Additionally, we employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to fine-tune both the SQL generation and revision models via reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing output quality. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CSC-SQL. On the BIRD development set, our 3B model achieves 65.28% execution accuracy, while the 7B model achieves 69.19%. The code will be open sourced at https://github.com/CycloneBoy/csc_sql.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Rank, Chunk and Expand}$: Lineage-Oriented Reasoning for Taxonomy Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taxonomies are hierarchical knowledge graphs crucial for recommendation systems, and web applications. As data grows, expanding taxonomies is essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We propose LORex ($\textbf{L}$ineage-$\textbf{O}$riented $\textbf{Re}$asoning for Taxonomy E$\textbf{x}$pansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy by 12% and Wu &amp; Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>I'll believe it when I see it: Images increase misinformation sharing in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly integrated into news recommendation systems, raising concerns about their role in spreading misinformation. In humans, visual content is known to boost credibility and shareability of information, yet its effect on vision-language models (VLMs) remains unclear. We present the first study examining how images influence VLMs' propensity to reshare news content, whether this effect varies across model families, and how persona conditioning and content attributes modulate this behavior. To support this analysis, we introduce two methodological contributions: a jailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy that elicits resharing decisions from VLMs while simulating users with antisocial traits and political alignments; and a multimodal dataset of fact-checked political news from PolitiFact, paired with corresponding images and ground-truth veracity labels. Experiments across model families reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for true news and 15.0% for false news. Persona conditioning further modulates this effect: Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news, whereas Republican-aligned profiles exhibit reduced veracity sensitivity. Of all the tested models, only Claude-3-Haiku demonstrates robustness to visual misinformation. These findings highlight emerging risks in multimodal model behavior and motivate the development of tailored evaluation frameworks and mitigation strategies for personalized AI systems.

      <title>RBF++: Quantifying and Optimizing Reasoning Boundaries across Measurable and Unmeasurable Capabilities for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has proven effective in enhancing large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks, spurring research into its underlying mechanisms. However, two primary challenges remain for real-world applications: (1) the lack of quantitative metrics and actionable guidelines for evaluating and optimizing measurable boundaries of CoT capability, and (2) the absence of methods to assess boundaries of unmeasurable CoT capability, such as multimodal perception. To address these gaps, we introduce the Reasoning Boundary Framework++ (RBF++). To tackle the first challenge, we define the reasoning boundary (RB) as the maximum limit of CoT performance. We also propose a combination law for RBs, enabling quantitative analysis and offering actionable guidance across various CoT tasks. For the second challenge, particularly in multimodal scenarios, we introduce a constant assumption, which replaces unmeasurable RBs with scenario-specific constants. Additionally, we propose the reasoning boundary division mechanism, which divides unmeasurable RBs into two sub-boundaries, facilitating the quantification and optimization of both unmeasurable domain knowledge and multimodal perception capabilities. Extensive experiments involving 38 models across 13 tasks validate the feasibility of our framework in cross-modal settings. Additionally, we evaluate 10 CoT strategies, offer insights into optimization and decay from two complementary perspectives, and expand evaluation benchmarks for measuring RBs in LLM reasoning. We hope this work advances the understanding of RBs and optimization strategies in LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/LightChen233/reasoning-boundary.</description>

      <title>GUARD: Generation-time LLM Unlearning via Adaptive Restriction and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in memorizing vast amounts of knowledge across diverse domains. However, the ability to selectively forget specific knowledge is critical for ensuring the safety and compliance of deployed models. Existing unlearning efforts typically fine-tune the model with resources such as forget data, retain data, and a calibration model. These additional gradient steps blur the decision boundary between forget and retain knowledge, making unlearning often at the expense of overall performance. To avoid the negative impact of fine-tuning, it would be better to unlearn solely at inference time by safely guarding the model against generating responses related to the forget target, without destroying the fluency of text generation. In this work, we propose Generation-time Unlearning via Adaptive Restriction and Detection (GUARD), a framework that enables dynamic unlearning during LLM generation. Specifically, we first employ a prompt classifier to detect unlearning targets and extract the corresponding forbidden token. We then dynamically penalize and filter candidate tokens during generation using a combination of token matching and semantic matching, effectively preventing the model from leaking the forgotten content. Experimental results on copyright content unlearning tasks over the Harry Potter dataset and the MUSE benchmark, as well as entity unlearning tasks on the TOFU dataset, demonstrate that GUARD achieves strong forget quality across various tasks while causing almost no degradation to the LLM's general capabilities, striking an excellent trade-off between forgetting and utility.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Stateful Tool Use in Multi-Turn Dialogues: Benchmarks and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks that assess Language Models (LMs) as Language Agents (LAs) for tool use primarily focus on stateless, single-turn interactions or partial evaluations, such as tool selection in a single turn, overlooking the inherent stateful nature of interactions in multi-turn applications. To fulfill this gap, we propose \texttt{DialogTool}, a multi-turn dialogue dataset with stateful tool interactions considering the whole life cycle of tool use, across six key tasks in three stages: 1) \textit{tool creation}; 2) \textit{tool utilization}: tool awareness, tool selection, tool execution; and 3) \textit{role-consistent response}: response generation and role play. Furthermore, we build \texttt{VirtualMobile} -- an embodied virtual mobile evaluation environment to simulate API calls and assess the robustness of the created APIs\footnote{We will use tools and APIs alternatively, there are no significant differences between them in this paper.}. Taking advantage of these artifacts, we conduct comprehensive evaluation on 13 distinct open- and closed-source LLMs and provide detailed analysis at each stage, revealing that the existing state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well to use tools over long horizons.</description>

      <title>Contextual Paralinguistic Data Creation for Multi-Modal Speech-LLM: Data Condensation and Spoken QA Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset. The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>J4R: Learning to Judge with Equivalent Initial State Group Relative Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To keep pace with the increasing pace of large language models (LLM) development, model output evaluation has transitioned away from time-consuming human evaluation to automatic evaluation, where LLMs themselves are tasked with assessing and critiquing other model outputs. LLM-as-judge models are a class of generative evaluators that excel in evaluating relatively simple domains, like chat quality, but struggle in reasoning intensive domains where model responses contain more substantive and challenging content. To remedy existing judge shortcomings, we explore training judges with reinforcement learning (RL). We make three key contributions: (1) We propose the Equivalent Initial State Group Relative Policy Optimization (EIS-GRPO) algorithm, which allows us to train our judge to be robust to positional biases that arise in more complex evaluation settings. (2) We introduce ReasoningJudgeBench, a benchmark that evaluates judges in diverse reasoning settings not covered by prior work. (3) We train Judge for Reasoning (J4R), a 7B judge trained with EIS-GRPO that outperforms GPT-4o and the next best small judge by 6.7% and 9%, matching or exceeding the performance of larger GRPO-trained judges on both JudgeBench and ReasoningJudgeBench.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge Architectures to Prompt-Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as evaluators (LLM-as-a-Judge) for assessing the quality of machine-generated text. This paradigm offers scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to human annotation. However, the reliability and security of such systems, particularly their robustness against adversarial manipulations, remain critical concerns. This paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge architectures to prompt-injection attacks, where malicious inputs are designed to compromise the judge's decision-making process. We formalize two primary attack strategies: Comparative Undermining Attack (CUA), which directly targets the final decision output, and Justification Manipulation Attack (JMA), which aims to alter the model's generated reasoning. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) optimization method, we craft adversarial suffixes appended to one of the responses being compared. Experiments conducted on the MT-Bench Human Judgments dataset with open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and Falcon3-3B-Instruct) demonstrate significant susceptibility. The CUA achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 30\%, while JMA also shows notable effectiveness. These findings highlight substantial vulnerabilities in current LLM-as-a-Judge systems, underscoring the need for robust defense mechanisms and further research into adversarial evaluation and trustworthiness in LLM-based assessment frameworks.</description>

      <title>Sense and Sensitivity: Examining the Influence of Semantic Recall on Long Context Code Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although modern Large Language Models (LLMs) support extremely large contexts, their effectiveness in utilizing long context for code reasoning remains unclear. This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability. Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval) and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall. Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity, potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context information.</description>

      <title>What Prompts Don't Say: Understanding and Managing Underspecification in LLM Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building LLM-powered software requires developers to communicate their requirements through natural language, but developer prompts are frequently underspecified, failing to fully capture many user-important requirements. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of prompt underspecification, showing that while LLMs can often (41.1%) guess unspecified requirements by default, such behavior is less robust: Underspecified prompts are 2x more likely to regress over model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops by more than 20%. We then demonstrate that simply adding more requirements to a prompt does not reliably improve performance, due to LLMs' limited instruction-following capabilities and competing constraints, and standard prompt optimizers do not offer much help. To address this, we introduce novel requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that can improve performance by 4.8% on average over baselines that naively specify everything in the prompt. Beyond prompt optimization, we envision that effectively managing prompt underspecification requires a broader process, including proactive requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Thinkless: LLM Learns When to Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning, have demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical inference. However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems admit straightforward solutions. This motivates an open question: Can LLMs learn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability. Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two control tokens, &lt;short&gt; for concise responses and &lt;think&gt; for detailed reasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the accuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO. Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% - 90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models.

      <title>R3: Robust Rubric-Agnostic Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning language model outputs with human preferences, yet existing approaches often lack both controllability and interpretability. These models are typically optimized for narrow objectives, limiting their generalizability to broader downstream tasks. Moreover, their scalar outputs are difficult to interpret without contextual reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce R3, a novel reward modeling framework that is rubric-agnostic, generalizable across evaluation dimensions, and provides interpretable, reasoned score assignments. R3 enables more transparent and flexible evaluation of language models, supporting robust alignment with diverse human values and use cases. Our models, data, and code are available as open source at https://github.com/rubricreward/r3</description>

      <title>MR. Judge: Multimodal Reasoner as a Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paradigm of using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as evaluative judges has emerged as an effective approach in RLHF and inference-time scaling. In this work, we propose Multimodal Reasoner as a Judge (MR. Judge), a paradigm for empowering general-purpose MLLMs judges with strong reasoning capabilities. Instead of directly assigning scores for each response, we formulate the judgement process as a reasoning-inspired multiple-choice problem. Specifically, the judge model first conducts deliberate reasoning covering different aspects of the responses and eventually selects the best response from them. This reasoning process not only improves the interpretibility of the judgement, but also greatly enhances the performance of MLLM judges. To cope with the lack of questions with scored responses, we propose the following strategy to achieve automatic annotation: 1) Reverse Response Candidates Synthesis: starting from a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset, we treat the original response as the best candidate and prompt the MLLM to generate plausible but flawed negative candidates. 2) Text-based reasoning extraction: we carefully design a data synthesis pipeline for distilling the reasoning capability from a text-based reasoning model, which is adopted to enable the MLLM judges to regain complex reasoning ability via warm up supervised fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our MR. Judge is effective across a wide range of tasks. Specifically, our MR. Judge-7B surpasses GPT-4o by 9.9% on VL-RewardBench, and improves performance on MM-Vet during inference-time scaling by up to 7.7%.</description>

      <title>Granary: Speech Recognition and Translation Dataset in 25 European Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task and multilingual approaches benefit large models, yet speech processing for low-resource languages remains underexplored due to data scarcity. To address this, we present Granary, a large-scale collection of speech datasets for recognition and translation across 25 European languages. This is the first open-source effort at this scale for both transcription and translation. We enhance data quality using a pseudo-labeling pipeline with segmentation, two-pass inference, hallucination filtering, and punctuation restoration. We further generate translation pairs from pseudo-labeled transcriptions using EuroLLM, followed by a data filtration pipeline. Designed for efficiency, our pipeline processes vast amount of data within hours. We assess models trained on processed data by comparing their performance on previously curated datasets for both high- and low-resource languages. Our findings show that these models achieve similar performance using approx. 50% less data. Dataset will be made available at https://hf.co/datasets/nvidia/Granary</description>

      <title>AdaptThink: Reasoning Models Can Learn When to Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have achieved impressive performance on various tasks by employing human-like deep thinking. However, the lengthy thinking process substantially increases inference overhead, making efficiency a critical bottleneck. In this work, we first demonstrate that NoThinking, which prompts the reasoning model to skip thinking and directly generate the final solution, is a better choice for relatively simple tasks in terms of both performance and efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose AdaptThink, a novel RL algorithm to teach reasoning models to choose the optimal thinking mode adaptively based on problem difficulty. Specifically, AdaptThink features two core components: (1) a constrained optimization objective that encourages the model to choose NoThinking while maintaining the overall performance; (2) an importance sampling strategy that balances Thinking and NoThinking samples during on-policy training, thereby enabling cold start and allowing the model to explore and exploit both thinking modes throughout the training process. Our experiments indicate that AdaptThink significantly reduces the inference costs while further enhancing performance. Notably, on three math datasets, AdaptThink reduces the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B by 53% and improves its accuracy by 2.4%, highlighting the promise of adaptive thinking-mode selection for optimizing the balance between reasoning quality and efficiency.

      <title>Dementia Through Different Eyes: Explainable Modeling of Human and LLM Perceptions for Early Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive decline often surfaces in language years before diagnosis. It is frequently non-experts, such as those closest to the patient, who first sense a change and raise concern. As LLMs become integrated into daily communication and used over prolonged periods, it may even be an LLM that notices something is off. But what exactly do they notice--and should be noticing--when making that judgment? This paper investigates how dementia is perceived through language by non-experts. We presented transcribed picture descriptions to non-expert humans and LLMs, asking them to intuitively judge whether each text was produced by someone healthy or with dementia. We introduce an explainable method that uses LLMs to extract high-level, expert-guided features representing these picture descriptions, and use logistic regression to model human and LLM perceptions and compare with clinical diagnoses. Our analysis reveals that human perception of dementia is inconsistent and relies on a narrow, and sometimes misleading, set of cues. LLMs, by contrast, draw on a richer, more nuanced feature set that aligns more closely with clinical patterns. Still, both groups show a tendency toward false negatives, frequently overlooking dementia cases. Through our interpretable framework and the insights it provides, we hope to help non-experts better recognize the linguistic signs that matter.</description>

      <title>SMOTExT: SMOTE meets Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data scarcity and class imbalance are persistent challenges in training robust NLP models, especially in specialized domains or low-resource settings. We propose a novel technique, SMOTExT, that adapts the idea of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) to textual data. Our method generates new synthetic examples by interpolating between BERT-based embeddings of two existing examples and then decoding the resulting latent point into text with xRAG architecture. By leveraging xRAG's cross-modal retrieval-generation framework, we can effectively turn interpolated vectors into coherent text. While this is preliminary work supported by qualitative outputs only, the method shows strong potential for knowledge distillation and data augmentation in few-shot settings. Notably, our approach also shows promise for privacy-preserving machine learning: in early experiments, training models solely on generated data achieved comparable performance to models trained on the original dataset. This suggests a viable path toward safe and effective learning under data protection constraints.</description>

      <title>ChartMuseum: Testing Visual Reasoning Capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chart understanding presents a unique challenge for large vision-language models (LVLMs), as it requires the integration of sophisticated textual and visual reasoning capabilities. However, current LVLMs exhibit a notable imbalance between these skills, falling short on visual reasoning that is difficult to perform in text. We conduct a case study using a synthetic dataset solvable only through visual reasoning and show that model performance degrades significantly with increasing visual complexity, while human performance remains robust. We then introduce ChartMuseum, a new Chart Question Answering (QA) benchmark containing 1,162 expert-annotated questions spanning multiple reasoning types, curated from real-world charts across 184 sources, specifically built to evaluate complex visual and textual reasoning. Unlike prior chart understanding benchmarks -- where frontier models perform similarly and near saturation -- our benchmark exposes a substantial gap between model and human performance, while effectively differentiating model capabilities: although humans achieve 93% accuracy, the best-performing model Gemini-2.5-Pro attains only 63.0%, and the leading open-source LVLM Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct achieves only 38.5%. Moreover, on questions requiring primarily visual reasoning, all models experience a 35%-55% performance drop from text-reasoning-heavy question performance. Lastly, our qualitative error analysis reveals specific categories of visual reasoning that are challenging for current LVLMs.</description>

      <title>CIE: Controlling Language Model Text Generations Using Continuous Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning language models with user intent is becoming increasingly relevant to enhance user experience. This calls for designing methods that can allow users to control the properties of the language that LMs generate. For example, controlling the length of the generation, the complexity of the language that gets chosen, the sentiment, tone, etc. Most existing work attempts to integrate users' control by conditioning LM generations on natural language prompts or discrete control signals, which are often brittle and hard to scale. In this work, we are interested in \textit{continuous} control signals, ones that exist along a spectrum that can't easily be captured in a natural language prompt or via existing techniques in conditional generation. Through a case study in controlling the precise response-length of generations produced by LMs, we demonstrate how after fine-tuning, behaviors of language models can be controlled via continuous signals -- as vectors that are interpolated between a "low" and a "high" token embedding. Our method more reliably exerts response-length control than in-context learning methods or fine-tuning methods that represent the control signal as a discrete signal. Our full open-sourced code and datasets are available at https://github.com/vsamuel2003/CIE.</description>

      <title>TARGET: Benchmarking Table Retrieval for Generative Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data landscape is rich with structured data, often of high value to organizations, driving important applications in data analysis and machine learning. Recent progress in representation learning and generative models for such data has led to the development of natural language interfaces to structured data, including those leveraging text-to-SQL. Contextualizing interactions, either through conversational interfaces or agentic components, in structured data through retrieval-augmented generation can provide substantial benefits in the form of freshness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of answers. The key question is: how do we retrieve the right table(s) for the analytical query or task at hand? To this end, we introduce TARGET: a benchmark for evaluating TAble Retrieval for GEnerative Tasks. With TARGET we analyze the retrieval performance of different retrievers in isolation, as well as their impact on downstream tasks. We find that dense embedding-based retrievers far outperform a BM25 baseline which is less effective than it is for retrieval over unstructured text. We also surface the sensitivity of retrievers across various metadata (e.g., missing table titles), and demonstrate a stark variation of retrieval performance across datasets and tasks. TARGET is available at https://target-benchmark.github.io.</description>

      <title>ASR-FAIRBENCH: Measuring and Benchmarking Equity Across Speech Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become ubiquitous in everyday applications, yet significant disparities in performance across diverse demographic groups persist. In this work, we introduce the ASR-FAIRBENCH leaderboard which is designed to assess both the accuracy and equity of ASR models in real-time. Leveraging the Meta's Fair-Speech dataset, which captures diverse demographic characteristics, we employ a mixed-effects Poisson regression model to derive an overall fairness score. This score is integrated with traditional metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) to compute the Fairness Adjusted ASR Score (FAAS), providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Our approach reveals significant performance disparities in SOTA ASR models across demographic groups and offers a benchmark to drive the development of more inclusive ASR technologies.</description>

      <title>Spectral Policy Optimization: Coloring your Incorrect Reasoning in GRPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). One of the most widely used RL methods is Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)~\cite{Shao-2024-Deepseekmath}, known for its memory efficiency and success in training DeepSeek-R1~\cite{Guo-2025-Deepseek}. However, GRPO stalls when all sampled responses in a group are incorrect -- referred to as an \emph{all-negative-sample} group -- as it fails to update the policy, hindering learning progress. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a simple yet effective framework that introduces response diversity within all-negative-sample groups in GRPO using AI feedback. We also provide a theoretical analysis, via a stylized model, showing how this diversification improves learning dynamics. Second, we empirically validate our approach, showing the improved performance across various model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in both offline and online learning settings with 10 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our findings highlight that learning from all-negative-sample groups is not only feasible but beneficial, advancing recent insights from \citet{Xiong-2025-Minimalist}.</description>

      <title>Probing the Vulnerability of Large Language Models to Polysemantic Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polysemanticity -- where individual neurons encode multiple unrelated features -- is a well-known characteristic of large neural networks and remains a central challenge in the interpretability of language models. At the same time, its implications for model safety are also poorly understood. Leveraging recent advances in sparse autoencoders, we investigate the polysemantic structure of two small models (Pythia-70M and GPT-2-Small) and evaluate their vulnerability to targeted, covert interventions at the prompt, feature, token, and neuron levels. Our analysis reveals a consistent polysemantic topology shared across both models. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this structure can be exploited to mount effective interventions on two larger, black-box instruction-tuned models (LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct). These findings suggest not only the generalizability of the interventions but also point to a stable and transferable polysemantic structure that could potentially persist across architectures and training regimes.</description>

      <title>Using Reinforcement Learning to Train Large Language Models to Explain Human Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central goal of cognitive modeling is to develop models that not only predict human behavior but also provide insight into the underlying cognitive mechanisms. While neural network models trained on large-scale behavioral data often achieve strong predictive performance, they typically fall short in offering interpretable explanations of the cognitive processes they capture. In this work, we explore the potential of pretrained large language models (LLMs) to serve as dual-purpose cognitive models--capable of both accurate prediction and interpretable explanation in natural language. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards to guide LLMs toward generating explicit reasoning traces for explaining human risky choices. Our findings demonstrate that this approach produces high-quality explanations alongside strong quantitative predictions of human decisions.</description>

      <title>EnvInjection: Environmental Prompt Injection Attack to Multi-modal Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to induce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--referred to as the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited effectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these limitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage, which can be implemented by modifying the webpage's source code. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple webpage datasets shows that EnvInjection is highly effective and significantly outperforms existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Efficient Uncertainty Estimation via Distillation of Bayesian Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in uncertainty estimation for Large Language Models (LLMs) during downstream adaptation have addressed key challenges of reliability and simplicity. However, existing Bayesian methods typically require multiple sampling iterations during inference, creating significant efficiency issues that limit practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of eliminating the need for test-time sampling for LLM uncertainty estimation. Specifically, when given an off-the-shelf Bayesian LLM, we distill its aligned confidence into a non-Bayesian student LLM by minimizing the divergence between their predictive distributions. Unlike typical calibration methods, our distillation is carried out solely on the training dataset without the need of an additional validation dataset. This simple yet effective approach achieves N-times more efficient uncertainty estimation during testing, where N is the number of samples traditionally required by Bayesian LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation capabilities on training data can successfully generalize to unseen test data through our distillation technique, consistently producing results comparable to (or even better than) state-of-the-art Bayesian LLMs.</description>

      <title>Token-Level Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios, making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a token-level uncertainty estimation framework to enable LLMs to self-assess and self-improve their generation quality in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce low-rank random weight perturbation to LLM decoding, generating predictive distributions that we use to estimate token-level uncertainties. We then aggregate these uncertainties to reflect semantic uncertainty of the generated sequences. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that our token-level uncertainty metrics strongly correlate with answer correctness and model robustness. Additionally, we explore using uncertainty to directly enhance the model's reasoning performance through multiple generations and the particle filtering algorithm. Our approach consistently outperforms existing uncertainty estimation methods, establishing effective uncertainty estimation as a valuable tool for both evaluating and improving reasoning generation in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Feature Hedging: Correlated Features Break Narrow Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic activations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations are composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we find that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying "true features" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features, the SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying monosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true. This phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction loss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the problem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and empirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one of the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines. Finally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved variant of matryoshka SAEs. Our work shows there remain fundamental issues with SAEs, but we are hopeful that that highlighting feature hedging will catalyze future advances that allow SAEs to achieve their full potential of interpreting LLMs at scale.</description>

Abstract: Interpretability research now offers a variety of techniques for identifying abstract internal mechanisms in neural networks. Can such techniques be used to predict how models will behave on out-of-distribution examples? In this work, we provide a positive answer to this question. Through a diverse set of language modeling tasks--including symbol manipulation, knowledge retrieval, and instruction following--we show that the most robust features for correctness prediction are those that play a distinctive causal role in the model's behavior. Specifically, we propose two methods that leverage causal mechanisms to predict the correctness of model outputs: counterfactual simulation (checking whether key causal variables are realized) and value probing (using the values of those variables to make predictions). Both achieve high AUC-ROC in distribution and outperform methods that rely on causal-agnostic features in out-of-distribution settings, where predicting model behaviors is more crucial. Our work thus highlights a novel and significant application for internal causal analysis of language models.</description>

      <title>VenusX: Unlocking Fine-Grained Functional Understanding of Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have driven significant progress in predicting protein function and interactions at the protein level. While these advancements have been invaluable for many biological applications such as enzyme engineering and function annotation, a more detailed perspective is essential for understanding protein functional mechanisms and evaluating the biological knowledge captured by models. To address this demand, we introduce VenusX, the first large-scale benchmark for fine-grained functional annotation and function-based protein pairing at the residue, fragment, and domain levels. VenusX comprises three major task categories across six types of annotations, including residue-level binary classification, fragment-level multi-class classification, and pairwise functional similarity scoring for identifying critical active sites, binding sites, conserved sites, motifs, domains, and epitopes. The benchmark features over 878,000 samples curated from major open-source databases such as InterPro, BioLiP, and SAbDab. By providing mixed-family and cross-family splits at three sequence identity thresholds, our benchmark enables a comprehensive assessment of model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. For baseline evaluation, we assess a diverse set of popular and open-source models, including pre-trained protein language models, sequence-structure hybrids, structure-based methods, and alignment-based techniques. Their performance is reported across all benchmark datasets and evaluation settings using multiple metrics, offering a thorough comparison and a strong foundation for future research. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ai4protein/VenusX.</description>

      <title>Video-SafetyBench: A Benchmark for Safety Evaluation of Video LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises safety concerns under potential malicious inputs. However, existing multimodal safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48 fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration. Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Fair-PP: A Synthetic Dataset for Aligning LLM with Personalized Preferences of Social Equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human preference plays a crucial role in the refinement of large language models (LLMs). However, collecting human preference feedback is costly and most existing datasets neglect the correlation between personalization and preferences. To address this issue, we introduce Fair-PP, a synthetic dataset of personalized preferences targeting social equity, derived from real-world social survey data, which includes 28 social groups, 98 equity topics, and 5 personal preference dimensions. Leveraging GPT-4o-mini, we engage in role-playing based on seven representative persona portrayals guided by existing social survey data, yielding a total of 238,623 preference records. Through Fair-PP, we also contribute (i) An automated framework for generating preference data, along with a more fine-grained dataset of personalized preferences; (ii) analysis of the positioning of the existing mainstream LLMs across five major global regions within the personalized preference space; and (iii) a sample reweighting method for personalized preference alignment, enabling alignment with a target persona while maximizing the divergence from other personas. Empirical experiments show our method outperforms the baselines.</description>

      <title>J1: Exploring Simple Test-Time Scaling for LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current focus of AI research is shifting from emphasizing model training towards enhancing evaluation quality, a transition that is crucial for driving further advancements in AI systems. Traditional evaluation methods typically rely on reward models assigning scalar preference scores to outputs. Although effective, such approaches lack interpretability, leaving users often uncertain about why a reward model rates a particular response as high or low. The advent of LLM-as-a-Judge provides a more scalable and interpretable method of supervision, offering insights into the decision-making process. Moreover, with the emergence of large reasoning models, which consume more tokens for deeper thinking and answer refinement, scaling test-time computation in the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm presents an avenue for further boosting performance and providing more interpretability through reasoning traces. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{J1-7B}$, which is first supervised fine-tuned on reflection-enhanced datasets collected via rejection-sampling and subsequently trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with verifiable rewards. At inference time, we apply Simple Test-Time Scaling (STTS) strategies for additional performance improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that $\textbf{J1-7B}$ surpasses the previous state-of-the-art LLM-as-a-Judge by $ \textbf{4.8}$\% and exhibits a $ \textbf{5.1}$\% stronger scaling trend under STTS. Additionally, we present three key findings: (1) Existing LLM-as-a-Judge does not inherently exhibit such scaling trend. (2) Model simply fine-tuned on reflection-enhanced datasets continues to demonstrate similarly weak scaling behavior. (3) Significant scaling trend emerges primarily during the RL phase, suggesting that effective STTS capability is acquired predominantly through RL training.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Analytical Software Engineering Design Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As modern software systems expand in scale and complexity, the challenges associated with their modeling and formulation grow increasingly intricate. Traditional approaches often fall short in effectively addressing these complexities, particularly in tasks such as design pattern detection for maintenance and assessment, as well as code refactoring for optimization and long-term sustainability. This growing inadequacy underscores the need for a paradigm shift in how such challenges are approached and resolved. This paper presents Analytical Software Engineering (ASE), a novel design paradigm aimed at balancing abstraction, tool accessibility, compatibility, and scalability. ASE enables effective modeling and resolution of complex software engineering problems. The paradigm is evaluated through two frameworks Behavioral-Structural Sequences (BSS) and Optimized Design Refactoring (ODR), both developed in accordance with ASE principles. BSS offers a compact, language-agnostic representation of codebases to facilitate precise design pattern detection. ODR unifies artifact and solution representations to optimize code refactoring via heuristic algorithms while eliminating iterative computational overhead. By providing a structured approach to software design challenges, ASE lays the groundwork for future research in encoding and analyzing complex software metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Science of Science (SoS) explores the mechanisms underlying scientific discovery, and offers valuable insights for enhancing scientific efficiency and fostering innovation. Traditional approaches often rely on simplistic assumptions and basic statistical tools, such as linear regression and rule-based simulations, which struggle to capture the complexity and scale of modern research ecosystems. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) presents a transformative opportunity for the next generation of SoS, enabling the automation of large-scale pattern discovery and uncovering insights previously unattainable. This paper offers a forward-looking perspective on the integration of Science of Science with AI for automated research pattern discovery and highlights key open challenges that could greatly benefit from AI. We outline the advantages of AI over traditional methods, discuss potential limitations, and propose pathways to overcome them. Additionally, we present a preliminary multi-agent system as an illustrative example to simulate research societies, showcasing AI's ability to replicate real-world research patterns and accelerate progress in Science of Science research.</description>

      <title>Tiny QA Benchmark++: Ultra-Lightweight, Synthetic Multilingual Dataset Generation &amp; Smoke-Tests for Continuous LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tiny QA Benchmark++ (TQB++) presents an ultra-lightweight, multilingual smoke-test suite designed to give large-language-model (LLM) pipelines a unit-test style safety net dataset that runs in seconds with minimal cost. Born out of the tight feedback-loop demands building the Comet Opik prompt-optimization SDK, where waiting on heavyweight benchmarks breaks developer flow. TQB++ couples a 52-item English gold set (less than 20 kB) with a tiny synthetic-data generator pypi package built on provider-agnostic LiteLLM. The generator lets practitioners mint their own tiny packs in any language, domain, or difficulty, while ten ready-made packs already cover Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. Every dataset ships with Croissant metadata and plug-and-play files for OpenAI-Evals, LangChain, and standard CI tools, so teams can drop deterministic micro-benchmarks directly into pull-request gates, prompt-engineering loops, and production dashboards without touching GPU budgets. A complete TQB++ run adds only a few seconds to pipeline latency yet reliably flags prompt-template errors, tokenizer drift, and fine-tuning side-effects long before full-scale suites like MMLU or BIG-Bench would finish configuring. The entire framework is released to accelerate continuous, resource-efficient quality assurance across the generative-AI ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Demystifying and Enhancing the Efficiency of Large Language Model Based Search Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based search agents have shown remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks by dynamically decomposing problems and addressing them through interleaved reasoning and retrieval. However, this interleaved paradigm introduces substantial efficiency bottlenecks. First, we observe that both highly accurate and overly approximate retrieval methods degrade system efficiency: exact search incurs significant retrieval overhead, while coarse retrieval requires additional reasoning steps during generation. Second, we identify inefficiencies in system design, including improper scheduling and frequent retrieval stalls, which lead to cascading latency -- where even minor delays in retrieval amplify end-to-end inference time. To address these challenges, we introduce SearchAgent-X, a high-efficiency inference framework for LLM-based search agents. SearchAgent-X leverages high-recall approximate retrieval and incorporates two key techniques: priority-aware scheduling and non-stall retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SearchAgent-X consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as vLLM and HNSW-based retrieval across diverse tasks, achieving up to 3.4$\times$ higher throughput and 5$\times$ lower latency, without compromising generation quality. SearchAgent-X is available at https://github.com/tiannuo-yang/SearchAgent-X.</description>

      <title>LLM-BABYBENCH: Understanding and Evaluating Grounded Planning and Reasoning in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and reason within the constraints of interactive environments is crucial for developing capable AI agents. We introduce $\textbf{LLM-BabyBench}$, a new benchmark suite designed specifically for this purpose. Built upon a textual adaptation of the procedurally generated BabyAI grid world, this suite evaluates LLMs on three fundamental aspects of grounded intelligence: (1) predicting the consequences of actions on the environment state ($\textbf{Predict}$ task), (2) generating sequences of low-level actions to achieve specified objectives ($\textbf{Plan}$ task), and (3) decomposing high-level instructions into coherent subgoal sequences ($\textbf{Decompose}$ task). We detail the methodology for generating the three corresponding datasets ($\texttt{LLM-BabyBench-Predict}$, $\texttt{-Plan}$, $\texttt{-Decompose}$) by extracting structured information from an expert agent operating within the text-based environment. Furthermore, we provide a standardized evaluation harness and metrics, including environment interaction for validating generated plans, to facilitate reproducible assessment of diverse LLMs. Initial baseline results highlight the challenges posed by these grounded reasoning tasks. The benchmark suite, datasets, data generation code, and evaluation code are made publicly available ($\href{https://github.com/choukrani/llm-babybench}{\text{GitHub}}$, $\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/salem-mbzuai/LLM-BabyBench}{\text{HuggingFace}}$).</description>

      <title>EVALOOP: Assessing LLM Robustness in Programming from a Self-consistency Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Content Effects on Reasoning in Language Models through Fine-Grained Activation Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently demonstrate reasoning limitations, often conflating content plausibility (i.e., material inference) with logical validity (i.e., formal inference). This can result in biased inferences, where plausible arguments are incorrectly deemed logically valid or vice versa. Mitigating this limitation is critical, as it undermines the trustworthiness and generalizability of LLMs in applications that demand rigorous logical consistency. This paper investigates the problem of mitigating content biases on formal reasoning through activation steering. Specifically, we curate a controlled syllogistic reasoning dataset to disentangle formal validity from content plausibility. After localising the layers responsible for formal and material inference, we investigate contrastive activation steering methods for test-time interventions. An extensive empirical analysis on different LLMs reveals that contrastive steering consistently supports linear control over content biases. However, we observe that a static approach is insufficient for improving all the tested models. We then leverage the possibility to control content effects by dynamically determining the value of the steering parameters via fine-grained conditional methods. We found that conditional steering is effective on unresponsive models, achieving up to 15% absolute improvement in formal reasoning accuracy with a newly introduced kNN-based method (K-CAST). Finally, additional experiments reveal that steering for content effects is robust to prompt variations, incurs minimal side effects on language modeling capabilities, and can partially generalize to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks. Practically, this paper demonstrates that activation-level interventions can offer a scalable strategy for enhancing the robustness of LLMs, contributing towards more systematic and unbiased formal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Reward Inside the Model: A Lightweight Hidden-State Reward Model for LLM's Best-of-N sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality reward models are crucial for unlocking the reasoning potential of large language models (LLMs), with best-of-N voting demonstrating significant performance gains. However, current reward models, which typically operate on the textual output of LLMs, are computationally expensive and parameter-heavy, limiting their real-world applications. We introduce the Efficient Linear Hidden State Reward (ELHSR) model - a novel, highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages the rich information embedded in LLM hidden states to address these issues. ELHSR systematically outperform baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only a few samples for training. ELHSR also achieves orders-of-magnitude efficiency improvement with significantly less time and fewer FLOPs per sample than baseline reward models. Moreover, ELHSR exhibits robust performance even when trained only on logits, extending its applicability to some closed-source LLMs. In addition, ELHSR can also be combined with traditional reward models to achieve additional performance gains.</description>

      <title>LightRetriever: A LLM-based Hybrid Retrieval Architecture with 1000x Faster Query Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based hybrid retrieval uses LLMs to encode queries and documents into low-dimensional dense or high-dimensional sparse vectors. It retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based hybrid retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full-sized LLM on an H800 GPU, our approach achieves over a 1000x speedup for query inference with GPU acceleration, and even a 20x speedup without GPU. Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method generalizes well across diverse retrieval tasks, retaining an average of 95% full-sized performance.</description>

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Evidence from Analyst Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less known-role in subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.</description>

      <title>Efficient RL Training for Reasoning Models via Length-Aware Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1, have demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning tasks but often incur a long reasoning path with significant memory and time costs. Existing methods primarily aim to shorten reasoning paths by introducing additional training data and stages. In this paper, we propose three critical reward designs integrated directly into the reinforcement learning process of large reasoning models, which reduce the response length without extra training stages. Experiments on four settings show that our method significantly decreases response length while maintaining or even improving performance. Specifically, in a logic reasoning setting, we achieve a 40% reduction in response length averaged by steps alongside a 14% gain in performance. For math problems, we reduce response length averaged by steps by 33% while preserving performance.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Point Judgment: Distribution Alignment for LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful evaluators in the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, offering significant efficiency and flexibility compared to human judgments. However, previous methods primarily rely on single-point evaluations, overlooking the inherent diversity and uncertainty in human evaluations. This approach leads to information loss and decreases the reliability of evaluations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework that explicitly aligns the LLM-generated judgment distribution with empirical human distributions. Specifically, we propose a distributional alignment objective based on KL divergence, combined with an auxiliary cross-entropy regularization to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, considering that empirical distributions may derive from limited human annotations, we incorporate adversarial training to enhance model robustness against distribution perturbations. Extensive experiments across various LLM backbones and evaluation tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing closed-source LLMs and conventional single-point alignment methods, with improved alignment quality, evaluation accuracy, and robustness.</description>

      <title>LogicOCR: Do Your Large Multimodal Models Excel at Logical Reasoning on Text-Rich Images?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly improved their reasoning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities. However, their performance on complex logical reasoning tasks involving text-rich images remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicOCR, a benchmark comprising 1,100 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate LMMs' logical reasoning abilities on text-rich images, while minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge (e.g., mathematics). We construct LogicOCR by curating a text corpus from the Chinese National Civil Servant Examination and develop a scalable, automated pipeline to convert it into multimodal samples. First, we design prompt templates to steer GPT-Image-1 to generate images with diverse backgrounds, interleaved text-illustration layouts, and varied fonts, ensuring contextual relevance and visual realism. Then, the generated images are manually verified, with low-quality examples discarded. We evaluate a range of representative open-source and proprietary LMMs under both Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and direct-answer settings. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals key insights, such as the impact of test-time scaling, input modality differences, and sensitivity to visual-text orientation. Notably, LMMs still lag in multimodal reasoning compared to text-only inputs, indicating that they have not fully bridged visual reading with reasoning. We hope LogicOCR will serve as a valuable resource for advancing multimodal reasoning research. The dataset is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/LogicOCR.</description>

Abstract: Video-based spatial cognition is vital for robotics and embodied AI but challenges current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Towards Visuospatial Cognition via Hierarchical Fusion of Visual Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2 (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial reasoning. ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>MedAgentBoard: Benchmarking Multi-Agent Collaboration with Conventional Methods for Diverse Medical Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stimulated interest in multi-agent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks. However, the practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability, failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches. MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical (visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically, specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific, evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine. It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains. All code, datasets, detailed prompts, and experimental results are open-sourced at https://medagentboard.netlify.app/.</description>

      <title>IP Leakage Attacks Targeting LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent. Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts, MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components, including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential defenses.</description>

      <title>UFO-RL: Uncertainty-Focused Optimization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling RL for LLMs is computationally expensive, largely due to multi-sampling for policy optimization and evaluation, making efficient data selection crucial. Inspired by the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, we hypothesize LLMs learn best from data within their potential comprehension zone. Addressing the limitation of conventional, computationally intensive multi-sampling methods for data assessment, we introduce UFO-RL. This novel framework uses a computationally efficient single-pass uncertainty estimation to identify informative data instances, achieving up to 185x faster data evaluation. UFO-RL leverages this metric to select data within the estimated ZPD for training. Experiments show that training with just 10% of data selected by UFO-RL yields performance comparable to or surpassing full-data training, reducing overall training time by up to 16x while enhancing stability and generalization. UFO-RL offers a practical and highly efficient strategy for scaling RL fine-tuning of LLMs by focusing learning on valuable data.</description>

      <title>mCLM: A Function-Infused and Synthesis-Friendly Modular Chemical Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge and accurately generate sequential representations, large language models (LLMs) remain limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with drug-like properties. In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make in the lab. To more effectively enable the discovery of functional small molecules, LLMs need to learn a molecular language. However, LLMs are currently limited by encoding molecules from atoms. In this paper, we argue that just like tokenizing texts into (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules should be decomposed and reassembled at the level of functional building blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model tokenizing molecules into building blocks and learning a bilingual language model of both natural language descriptions of functions and molecule building blocks. By reasoning on such functional building blocks, mCLM guarantees to generate efficiently synthesizable molecules thanks to recent progress in block-based chemistry, while also improving the functions of molecules in a principled manner. In experiments on 430 FDA-approved drugs, we find mCLM capable of significantly improving 5 out of 6 chemical functions critical to determining drug potentials. More importantly, mCLM can reason on multiple functions and improve the FDA-rejected drugs (``fallen angels'') over multiple iterations to greatly improve their shortcomings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with auxiliary tokens has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing model performance. In this work, we introduce a lightweight method termed latent tokens; these are dummy tokens that may be non-interpretable in natural language but steer the autoregressive decoding process of a Transformer-based LLM via the attention mechanism. The proposed latent tokens can be seamlessly integrated with a pre-trained Transformer, trained in a parameter-efficient manner, and applied flexibly at inference time, while adding minimal complexity overhead to the existing infrastructure of standard Transformers. We propose several hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of latent tokens and design synthetic tasks accordingly to verify them. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method noticeably outperforms the baselines, particularly in the out-of-distribution generalization scenarios, highlighting its potential in improving the adaptability of LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have sparked significant interest in developing GUI visual agents. We introduce MONDAY (Mobile OS Navigation Task Dataset for Agents from YouTube), a large-scale dataset of 313K annotated frames from 20K instructional videos capturing diverse real-world mobile OS navigation across multiple platforms. Models that include MONDAY in their pre-training phases demonstrate robust cross-platform generalization capabilities, consistently outperforming models trained on existing single OS datasets while achieving an average performance gain of 18.11%p on an unseen mobile OS platform. To enable continuous dataset expansion as mobile platforms evolve, we present an automated framework that leverages publicly available video content to create comprehensive task datasets without manual annotation. Our framework comprises robust OCR-based scene detection (95.04% F1score), near-perfect UI element detection (99.87% hit ratio), and novel multi-step action identification to extract reliable action sequences across diverse interface configurations. We contribute both the MONDAY dataset and our automated collection framework to facilitate future research in mobile OS navigation.</description>

      <title>Ineq-Comp: Benchmarking Human-Intuitive Compositional Reasoning in Automated Theorem Proving on Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based formal proof assistants (e.g., in Lean) hold great promise for automating mathematical discovery. But beyond syntactic correctness, do these systems truly understand mathematical structure as humans do? We investigate this question through the lens of mathematical inequalities -- a fundamental tool across many domains. While modern provers can solve basic inequalities, we probe their ability to handle human-intuitive compositionality. We introduce Ineq-Comp, a benchmark built from elementary inequalities through systematic transformations, including variable duplication, algebraic rewriting, and multi-step composition. Although these problems remain easy for humans, we find that most provers -- including Goedel, STP, and Kimina-7B -- struggle significantly. DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B shows relative robustness -- possibly because it is trained to decompose the problems into sub-problems -- but still suffers a 20\% performance drop (pass@32). Strikingly, performance remains poor for all models even when formal proofs of the constituent parts are provided in context, revealing that the source of weakness is indeed in compositional reasoning. Our results expose a persisting gap between the generalization behavior of current AI provers and human mathematical intuition.</description>

This paper investigates whether such persona conditioning affects model safety under bullying, an adversarial manipulation that applies psychological pressures in order to force the victim to comply to the attacker. We introduce a simulation framework in which an attacker LLM engages a victim LLM using psychologically grounded bullying tactics, while the victim adopts personas aligned with the Big Five personality traits. Experiments using multiple open-source LLMs and a wide range of adversarial goals reveal that certain persona configurations -- such as weakened agreeableness or conscientiousness -- significantly increase victim's susceptibility to unsafe outputs. Bullying tactics involving emotional or sarcastic manipulation, such as gaslighting and ridicule, are particularly effective. These findings suggest that persona-driven interaction introduces a novel vector for safety risks in LLMs and highlight the need for persona-aware safety evaluation and alignment strategies.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Reward Model Evaluation Through the Lens of Reward Overoptimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), aligning model behavior with human preferences. However, existing benchmarks for reward models show a weak correlation with the performance of optimized policies, suggesting that they fail to accurately assess the true capabilities of RMs. To bridge this gap, we explore several evaluation designs through the lens of reward overoptimization\textemdash a phenomenon that captures both how well the reward model aligns with human preferences and the dynamics of the learning signal it provides to the policy. The results highlight three key findings on how to construct a reliable benchmark: (i) it is important to minimize differences between chosen and rejected responses beyond correctness, (ii) evaluating reward models requires multiple comparisons across a wide range of chosen and rejected responses, and (iii) given that reward models encounter responses with diverse representations, responses should be sourced from a variety of models. However, we also observe that a extremely high correlation with degree of overoptimization leads to comparatively lower correlation with certain downstream performance. Thus, when designing a benchmark, it is desirable to use the degree of overoptimization as a useful tool, rather than the end goal.</description>

      <title>GEM: Gaussian Embedding Modeling for Out-of-Distribution Detection in GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding distances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary. Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the best-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/GEM-OODforGUIagents.</description>

      <title>Does Low Rank Adaptation Lead to Lower Robustness against Training-Time Attacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) thanks to its superb efficiency gains over previous methods. While extensive studies have examined the performance and structural properties of LoRA, its behavior upon training-time attacks remain underexplored, posing significant security risks. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the security implications of LoRA's low-rank structure during fine-tuning, in the context of its robustness against data poisoning and backdoor attacks. We propose an analytical framework that models LoRA's training dynamics, employs the neural tangent kernel to simplify the analysis of the training process, and applies information theory to establish connections between LoRA's low rank structure and its vulnerability against training-time attacks. Our analysis indicates that LoRA exhibits better robustness to backdoor attacks than full fine-tuning, while becomes more vulnerable to untargeted data poisoning due to its over-simplified information geometry. Extensive experimental evaluations have corroborated our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Detection and Mitigation of Hallucination in Large Reasoning Models: A Mechanistic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in multi-step reasoning tasks. However, alongside these successes, a more deceptive form of model error has emerged--Reasoning Hallucination--where logically coherent but factually incorrect reasoning traces lead to persuasive yet faulty conclusions. Unlike traditional hallucinations, these errors are embedded within structured reasoning, making them more difficult to detect and potentially more harmful. In this work, we investigate reasoning hallucinations from a mechanistic perspective. We propose the Reasoning Score, which quantifies the depth of reasoning by measuring the divergence between logits obtained from projecting late layers of LRMs to the vocabulary space, effectively distinguishing shallow pattern-matching from genuine deep reasoning. Using this score, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the ReTruthQA dataset and identify two key reasoning hallucination patterns: early-stage fluctuation in reasoning depth and incorrect backtracking to flawed prior steps. These insights motivate our Reasoning Hallucination Detection (RHD) framework, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. To mitigate reasoning hallucinations, we further introduce GRPO-R, an enhanced reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates step-level deep reasoning rewards via potential-based shaping. Our theoretical analysis establishes stronger generalization guarantees, and experiments demonstrate improved reasoning quality and reduced hallucination rates.</description>

      <title>TIME: A Multi-level Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning of LLMs in Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal reasoning is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the real world. However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event dynamics, and (3) complex temporal dependencies in social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-level benchmark TIME, designed for temporal reasoning in real-world scenarios. TIME consists of 38,522 QA pairs, covering 3 levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3 sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News, and TIME-Dial. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning models and non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/sylvain-wei/TIME , and the dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SylvainWei/TIME .</description>

      <title>AutoGEEval: A Multimodal and Automated Framework for Geospatial Code Generation on GEE with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geospatial code generation is emerging as a key direction in the integration of artificial intelligence and geoscientific analysis. However, there remains a lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated evaluation framework for geospatial code generation tasks on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform powered by large language models (LLMs). Built upon the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench) comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework integrates both question generation and answer verification components to enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and foundational resource for the development and assessment of geospatial code generation models, advancing the frontier of automated natural language to domain-specific code translation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM Inconsistency to Boost Pass@k Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive abilities in numerous domains, but exhibit inconsistent performance in response to minor input changes. Rather than view this as a drawback, in this paper we introduce a novel method for leveraging models' inconsistency to boost Pass@k performance. Specifically, we present a "Variator" agent that generates k variants of a given task and submits one candidate solution for each one. Our variant generation approach is applicable to a wide range of domains as it is task agnostic and compatible with free-form inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of our agent theoretically using a probabilistic model of the inconsistency effect, and show empirically that it outperforms the baseline on the APPS dataset. Furthermore, we establish that inconsistency persists even in frontier reasoning models across coding and cybersecurity domains, suggesting our method is likely to remain relevant for future model generations.</description>

      <title>Fractured Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>Evaluatiing the efficacy of LLM Safety Solutions : The Palit Benchmark Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into critical systems in industries like healthcare and finance. Users can often submit queries to LLM-enabled chatbots, some of which can enrich responses with information retrieved from internal databases storing sensitive data. This gives rise to a range of attacks in which a user submits a malicious query and the LLM-system outputs a response that creates harm to the owner, such as leaking internal data or creating legal liability by harming a third-party. While security tools are being developed to counter these threats, there is little formal evaluation of their effectiveness and usability. This study addresses this gap by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of LLM security tools. We identified 13 solutions (9 closed-source, 4 open-source), but only 7 were evaluated due to a lack of participation by proprietary model owners.To evaluate, we built a benchmark dataset of malicious prompts, and evaluate these tools performance against a baseline LLM model (ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). Our results show that the baseline model has too many false positives to be used for this task. Lakera Guard and ProtectAI LLM Guard emerged as the best overall tools showcasing the tradeoff between usability and performance. The study concluded with recommendations for greater transparency among closed source providers, improved context-aware detections, enhanced open-source engagement, increased user awareness, and the adoption of more representative performance metrics.</description>

      <title>MMAR: A Challenging Benchmark for Deep Reasoning in Speech, Audio, Music, and Their Mix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MMAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the deep reasoning capabilities of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) across massive multi-disciplinary tasks. MMAR comprises 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets, collected from real-world internet videos and refined through iterative error corrections and quality checks to ensure high quality. Unlike existing benchmarks that are limited to specific domains of sound, music, or speech, MMAR extends them to a broad spectrum of real-world audio scenarios, including mixed-modality combinations of sound, music, and speech. Each question in MMAR is hierarchically categorized across four reasoning layers: Signal, Perception, Semantic, and Cultural, with additional sub-categories within each layer to reflect task diversity and complexity. To further foster research in this area, we annotate every question with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationale to promote future advancements in audio reasoning. Each item in the benchmark demands multi-step deep reasoning beyond surface-level understanding. Moreover, a part of the questions requires graduate-level perceptual and domain-specific knowledge, elevating the benchmark's difficulty and depth. We evaluate MMAR using a broad set of models, including Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), Large Audio Reasoning Models (LARMs), Omni Language Models (OLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with audio caption inputs. The performance of these models on MMAR highlights the benchmark's challenging nature, and our analysis further reveals critical limitations of understanding and reasoning capabilities among current models. We hope MMAR will serve as a catalyst for future advances in this important but little-explored area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist developing program code beside many other things, but can they support working with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as well? Which LLM is offering the best capabilities in the field of Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE)? Is this possible to determine without checking many answers manually? The LLM-KG-Bench framework in Version 3.0 is designed to answer these questions. It consists of an extensible set of tasks for automated evaluation of LLM answers and covers different aspects of working with semantic technologies. In this paper the LLM-KG-Bench framework is presented in Version 3 along with a dataset of prompts, answers and evaluations generated with it and several state-of-the-art LLMs. Significant enhancements have been made to the framework since its initial release, including an updated task API that offers greater flexibility in handling evaluation tasks, revised tasks, and extended support for various open models through the vllm library, among other improvements. A comprehensive dataset has been generated using more than 30 contemporary open and proprietary LLMs, enabling the creation of exemplary model cards that demonstrate the models' capabilities in working with RDF and SPARQL, as well as comparing their performance on Turtle and JSON-LD RDF serialization tasks.</description>

      <title>FreeKV: Boosting KV Cache Retrieval for Efficient LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In planning, using LLMs not to predict plans but to formalize an environment into the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) has been shown to greatly improve performance and control. While most work focused on fully observable environments, we tackle the more realistic and challenging partially observable environments where existing methods are incapacitated by the lack of complete information. We propose PDDLego+, a framework to iteratively formalize, plan, grow, and refine PDDL representations in a zero-shot manner, without needing access to any existing trajectories. On two textual simulated environments, we show that PDDLego+ not only achieves superior performance, but also shows robustness against problem complexity. We also show that the domain knowledge captured after a successful trial is interpretable and benefits future tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Parameterised Quantum Circuits from Large Texts</title>

Abstract: Quantum approaches to natural language processing (NLP) are redefining how linguistic information is represented and processed. While traditional hybrid quantum-classical models rely heavily on classical neural networks, recent advancements propose a novel framework, DisCoCirc, capable of directly encoding entire documents as parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs), besides enjoying some additional interpretability and compositionality benefits. Following these ideas, this paper introduces an efficient methodology for converting large-scale texts into quantum circuits using tree-like representations of pregroup diagrams. Exploiting the compositional parallels between language and quantum mechanics, grounded in symmetric monoidal categories, our approach enables faithful and efficient encoding of syntactic and discourse relationships in long and complex texts (up to 6410 words in our experiments) to quantum circuits. The developed system is provided to the community as part of the augmented open-source quantum NLP package lambeq Gen II.</description>

      <title>Scaling Computer-Use Grounding via User Interface Decomposition and Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding, the ability to map natural language instructions to specific actions on graphical user interfaces, remains a critical bottleneck in computer use agent development. Current benchmarks oversimplify grounding tasks as short referring expressions, failing to capture the complexity of real-world interactions that require software commonsense, layout understanding, and fine-grained manipulation capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce OSWorld-G, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 564 finely annotated samples across diverse task types including text matching, element recognition, layout understanding, and precise manipulation. Additionally, we synthesize and release the largest computer use grounding dataset Jedi, which contains 4 million examples through multi-perspective decoupling of tasks. Our multi-scale models trained on Jedi demonstrate its effectiveness by outperforming existing approaches on ScreenSpot-v2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and our OSWorld-G. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improved grounding with Jedi directly enhances agentic capabilities of general foundation models on complex computer tasks, improving from 5% to 27% on OSWorld. Through detailed ablation studies, we identify key factors contributing to grounding performance and verify that combining specialized data for different interface elements enables compositional generalization to novel interfaces. All benchmark, data, checkpoints, and code are open-sourced and available at https://osworld-grounding.github.io.</description>

      <title>SAKURA: On the Multi-hop Reasoning of Large Audio-Language Models Based on Speech and Audio Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation. Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks, conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.</description>

      <title>Seek in the Dark: Reasoning via Test-Time Instance-Level Policy Gradient in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning ability, a core component of human intelligence, continues to pose a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the pursuit of AGI. Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law, significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating. Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA) within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures. Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging within a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also benefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of test-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a lightweight, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>CompeteSMoE -- Statistically Guaranteed Mixture of Experts Training via Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) offers an appealing solution to scale up the model complexity beyond the mean of increasing the network's depth or width. However, we argue that effective SMoE training remains challenging because of the suboptimal routing process where experts that perform computation do not directly contribute to the routing process. In this work, we propose competition, a novel mechanism to route tokens to experts with the highest neural response. Theoretically, we show that the competition mechanism enjoys a better sample efficiency than the traditional softmax routing. Furthermore, we develop CompeteSMoE, a simple yet effective algorithm to train large language models by deploying a router to learn the competition policy, thus enjoying strong performances at a low training overhead. Our extensive empirical evaluations on both the visual instruction tuning and language pre-training tasks demonstrate the efficacy, robustness, and scalability of CompeteSMoE compared to state-of-the-art SMoE strategies. We have made the implementation available at: https://github.com/Fsoft-AIC/CompeteSMoE. This work is an improved version of the previous study at arXiv:2402.02526</description>

      <title>IG Parser: A Software Package for the Encoding of Institutional Statements using the Institutional Grammar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides an overview of IG Parser, a software that facilitates qualitative content analysis of formal (e.g., legal) rules or informal (e.g., socio-normative) norms, and strategies (such as conventions) -- referred to as \emph{institutions} -- that govern social systems and operate configurally to describe \emph{institutional systems}. To this end, the IG Parser employs a distinctive syntax that ensures rigorous encoding of natural language, while automating the transformation into various formats that support the downstream analysis using diverse analytical techniques. The conceptual core of the IG Parser is an associated syntax, IG Script, that operationalizes the conceptual foundations of the Institutional Grammar, and more specifically Institutional Grammar 2.0, an analytical paradigm for institutional analysis. This article presents the IG Parser, including its conceptual foundations, syntactic specification of IG Script, alongside architectural principles. This introduction is augmented with selective illustrative examples that highlight the use and benefit associated with the tool.</description>

      <title>A Minimum Description Length Approach to Regularization in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art neural networks can be trained to become remarkable solutions to many problems. But while these architectures can express symbolic, perfect solutions, trained models often arrive at approximations instead. We show that the choice of regularization method plays a crucial role: when trained on formal languages with standard regularization ($L_1$, $L_2$, or none), expressive architectures not only fail to converge to correct solutions but are actively pushed away from perfect initializations. In contrast, applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to balance model complexity with data fit provides a theoretically grounded regularization method. Using MDL, perfect solutions are selected over approximations, independently of the optimization algorithm. We propose that unlike existing regularization techniques, MDL introduces the appropriate inductive bias to effectively counteract overfitting and promote generalization.</description>

      <title>CoT-Kinetics: A Theoretical Modeling Assessing LRM Reasoning Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models significantly improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models by learning to reason, exhibiting the promising performance in solving complex tasks. LRMs solve tasks that require complex reasoning by explicitly generating reasoning trajectories together with answers. Nevertheless, judging the quality of such an output answer is not easy because only considering the correctness of the answer is not enough and the soundness of the reasoning trajectory part matters as well. Logically, if the soundness of the reasoning part is poor, even if the answer is correct, the confidence of the derived answer should be low. Existing methods did consider jointly assessing the overall output answer by taking into account the reasoning part, however, their capability is still not satisfactory as the causal relationship of the reasoning to the concluded answer cannot properly reflected. In this paper, inspired by classical mechanics, we present a novel approach towards establishing a CoT-Kinetics energy equation. Specifically, our CoT-Kinetics energy equation formulates the token state transformation process, which is regulated by LRM internal transformer layers, as like a particle kinetics dynamics governed in a mechanical field. Our CoT-Kinetics energy assigns a scalar score to evaluate specifically the soundness of the reasoning phase, telling how confident the derived answer could be given the evaluated reasoning. As such, the LRM's overall output quality can be accurately measured, rather than a coarse judgment (e.g., correct or incorrect) anymore.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Quantized Neural Networks with Zeroth-order Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Anytime Reasoning via Budget Relative Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions, enhancing both training and token efficiency.</description>

      <title>Trust, But Verify: A Self-Verification Approach to Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in complex reasoning, with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) being a key enhancement strategy. However, a prevalent issue is ``superficial self-reflection'', where models fail to robustly verify their own outputs. We introduce RISE (Reinforcing Reasoning with Self-Verification), a novel online RL framework designed to tackle this. RISE explicitly and simultaneously trains an LLM to improve both its problem-solving and self-verification abilities within a single, integrated RL process. The core mechanism involves leveraging verifiable rewards from an outcome verifier to provide on-the-fly feedback for both solution generation and self-verification tasks. In each iteration, the model generates solutions, then critiques its own on-policy generated solutions, with both trajectories contributing to the policy update. Extensive experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently fostering strong self-verification skills. Our analyses highlight the advantages of online verification and the benefits of increased verification compute. Additionally, RISE models exhibit more frequent and accurate self-verification behaviors during reasoning. These advantages reinforce RISE as a flexible and effective path towards developing more robust and self-aware reasoners.</description>

      <title>Large Linguistic Models: Investigating LLMs' metalinguistic abilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00948v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) has recently improved to the point where models can perform well on many language tasks. We show here that--for the first time--the models can also generate valid metalinguistic analyses of language data. We outline a research program where the behavioral interpretability of LLMs on these tasks is tested via prompting. LLMs are trained primarily on text--as such, evaluating their metalinguistic abilities improves our understanding of their general capabilities and sheds new light on theoretical models in linguistics. We show that OpenAI's (2024) o1 vastly outperforms other models on tasks involving drawing syntactic trees and phonological generalization. We speculate that OpenAI o1's unique advantage over other models may result from the model's chain-of-thought mechanism, which mimics the structure of human reasoning used in complex cognitive tasks, such as linguistic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13673v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models are effective but complex, and understanding their inner workings and reasoning mechanisms is a significant challenge. Previous research has primarily explored how these models handle simple tasks like name copying or selection, and we extend this by investigating how these models perform recursive language structure reasoning defined by context-free grammars (CFGs). We introduce a family of synthetic CFGs that produce hierarchical rules, capable of generating lengthy sentences (e.g., hundreds of tokens) that are locally ambiguous and require dynamic programming to parse. Despite this complexity, we demonstrate that generative models like GPT can accurately learn and reason over CFG-defined hierarchies and generate sentences based on it. We explore the model's internals, revealing that its hidden states precisely capture the structure of CFGs, and its attention patterns resemble the information passing in a dynamic programming algorithm.
  This paper also presents several corollaries, including showing why absolute positional embeddings is inferior to relative and rotary embeddings; uniform attention alone is surprisingly effective (motivating our follow-up work on Canon layers); encoder-only models (e.g., BERT, DeBERTa) struggle with deep structure reasoning on CFGs compared to autoregressive models (e.g., GPT); and injecting structural or syntactic noise into pretraining data markedly improves robustness to corrupted language prompts.</description>

Abstract: Multilingual large-scale Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have been shown to store considerable amounts of factual knowledge, but large variations are observed across languages. With the ultimate goal of ensuring that users with different language backgrounds obtain consistent feedback from the same model, we study the cross-lingual consistency (CLC) of factual knowledge in various multilingual PLMs. To this end, we propose a Ranking-based Consistency (RankC) metric to evaluate knowledge consistency across languages independently from accuracy. Using this metric, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the determining factors for CLC, both at model level and at language-pair level. Among other results, we find that increasing model size leads to higher factual probing accuracy in most languages, but does not improve cross-lingual consistency. Finally, we conduct a case study on CLC when new factual associations are inserted in the PLMs via model editing. Results on a small sample of facts inserted in English reveal a clear pattern whereby the new piece of knowledge transfers only to languages with which English has a high RankC score.</description>

Several different instructional strategies are proposed both in online and offline environments to enhance learner engagement. The Concept Attainment Model is one such instructional strategy that focuses on learners acquiring a deeper understanding of a concept rather than just its dictionary definition. This is done by searching and listing the properties used to distinguish examples from non-examples of various concepts. Our work attempts to apply the Concept Attainment Model to build conceptual riddles, to deploy over online learning environments. The approach involves creating factual triples from learning resources, classifying them based on their uniqueness to a concept into `Topic Markers' and `Common', followed by generating riddles based on the Concept Attainment Model's format and capturing all possible solutions to those riddles. The results obtained from the human evaluation of riddles prove encouraging.</description>

Abstract: We introduce STAR (Stream Transduction with Anchor Representations), a novel Transformer-based model designed for efficient sequence-to-sequence transduction over streams. STAR dynamically segments input streams to create compressed anchor representations, achieving nearly lossless compression (12x) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and outperforming existing methods. Moreover, STAR demonstrates superior segmentation and latency-quality trade-offs in simultaneous speech-to-text tasks, optimizing latency, memory footprint, and quality.</description>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has marked a significant advancement in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Previous studies have developed various extensions of CoT, which focus primarily on enhancing end-task performance. In addition, there has been research on assessing the quality of reasoning chains in CoT. This raises an intriguing question: Is it possible to predict the accuracy of LLM outputs by scrutinizing the reasoning chains they generate? To answer this research question, we introduce a benchmark, R2PE, designed specifically to explore the relationship between reasoning chains and performance in various reasoning tasks spanning five different domains. This benchmark aims to measure the falsehood of the final output of LLMs based on the reasoning steps. To make full use of information in multiple reasoning chains, we propose the process discernibility score (PDS) framework that beats the answer-checking baseline by a large margin. Concretely, this resulted in an average of $5.1\%$ increase in the F1 score and $2.97\%$ improvement in AUC-PR across all 45 subsets within R2PE. We further demonstrate our PDS's efficacy in advancing open-domain QA accuracy.</description>

      <title>FormulaReasoning: A Dataset for Formula-Based Numerical Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12692v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of formulas (e.g., physics formulas) is a fundamental ability of humans when solving numerical reasoning problems. Existing numerical reasoning datasets seldom explicitly indicate the formulas employed in reasoning, as their questions rely on implicit commonsense mathematical knowledge. In contrast, in this paper, we introduce FormulaReasoning, a new dataset specifically designed for formula-based numerical reasoning. Each of the 4,751 questions in our dataset requires numerical calculation with external physics formulas, making it a more challenging benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs). We offer normalized fine-grained annotations for the questions, available in English and Chinese, including formula structures, parameter names, symbols, numerical values, and units, derived from extensive manual effort with LLM assistance for guaranteed quality. We also provide a consolidated formula database to serve as an external knowledge base accompanying the dataset. We employ FormulaReasoning to evaluate LLMs with 7B to over 100B parameters, and explore retrieval-augmented generation with the formula database. Our evaluation also covers supervised methods that break down the reasoning process into formula generation, parameter extraction, and numerical calculation, as well as direct preference optimization methods based on derived preference data.</description>

      <title>Comparing Specialised Small and General Large Language Models on Text Classification: 100 Labelled Samples to Achieve Break-Even Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When solving NLP tasks with limited labelled data, researchers typically either use a general large language model without further update, or use a small number of labelled samples to tune a specialised smaller model. In this work, we answer an important question -- how many labelled samples are required for the specialised small models to outperform general large models, while taking the performance variance into consideration. By observing the behaviour of fine-tuning, instruction-tuning, prompting and in-context learning on 8 language models, we identify such performance break-even points across 8 representative text classification tasks of varying characteristics. We show that the specialised models often need only few samples (on average $100$) to be on par or better than the general ones. At the same time, the number of required labels strongly depends on the dataset or task characteristics, with fine-tuning on binary datasets requiring significantly more samples. When performance variance is taken into consideration, the number of required labels increases on average by $100 - 200\%$. Finally, larger models do not consistently lead to better performance and lower variance, with 4-bit quantisation having negligible impact.</description>

      <title>From Languages to Geographies: Towards Evaluating Cultural Bias in Hate Speech Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perceptions of hate can vary greatly across cultural contexts. Hate speech (HS) datasets, however, have traditionally been developed by language. This hides potential cultural biases, as one language may be spoken in different countries home to different cultures. In this work, we evaluate cultural bias in HS datasets by leveraging two interrelated cultural proxies: language and geography. We conduct a systematic survey of HS datasets in eight languages and confirm past findings on their English-language bias, but also show that this bias has been steadily decreasing in the past few years. For three geographically-widespread languages -- English, Arabic and Spanish -- we then leverage geographical metadata from tweets to approximate geo-cultural contexts by pairing language and country information. We find that HS datasets for these languages exhibit a strong geo-cultural bias, largely overrepresenting a handful of countries (e.g., US and UK for English) relative to their prominence in both the broader social media population and the general population speaking these languages. Based on these findings, we formulate recommendations for the creation of future HS datasets.</description>

      <title>Sparse Matrix in Large Language Model Fine-tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LoRA and its variants have become popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods due to their ability to avoid excessive computational costs. However, an accuracy gap often exists between PEFT methods and full fine-tuning (FT), and this gap has yet to be systematically studied. In this work, we introduce a method for selecting sparse sub-matrices that aim to minimize the performance gap between PEFT vs. full fine-tuning (FT) while also reducing both fine-tuning computational cost and memory cost. Our Sparse Matrix Tuning (SMT) method begins by identifying the most significant sub-matrices in the gradient update, updating only these blocks during the fine-tuning process. In our experiments, we demonstrate that SMT consistently surpasses other PEFT baseline (e.g. LoRA and DoRA) in fine-tuning popular large language models such as LLaMA across a broad spectrum of tasks, while reducing the GPU memory footprint by 67% compared to FT. We also examine how the performance of LoRA and DoRA tends to plateau and decline as the number of trainable parameters increases, in contrast, our SMT method does not suffer from such issue.</description>

      <title>OR-Bench: An Over-Refusal Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require careful safety alignment to prevent malicious outputs. While significant research focuses on mitigating harmful content generation, the enhanced safety often come with the side effect of over-refusal, where LLMs may reject innocuous prompts and become less helpful. Although the issue of over-refusal has been empirically observed, a systematic measurement is challenging due to the difficulty of crafting prompts that can elicit the over-refusal behaviors of LLMs. This study proposes a novel method for automatically generating large-scale over-refusal datasets. Leveraging this technique, we introduce OR-Bench, the first large-scale over-refusal benchmark. OR-Bench comprises 80,000 over-refusal prompts across 10 common rejection categories, a subset of around 1,000 hard prompts that are challenging even for state-of-the-art LLMs, and an additional 600 toxic prompts to prevent indiscriminate responses. We then conduct a comprehensive study to measure the over-refusal of 32 popular LLMs across 8 model families. Our datasets are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/bench-llms and our codebase is open-sourced at https://github.com/justincui03/or-bench. We hope this benchmark can help the community develop better safety aligned models.</description>

      <title>ShareLoRA: Parameter Efficient and Robust Large Language Model Fine-tuning via Shared Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Share}d \textbf{Lo}w \textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}daptation (ShareLoRA), a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning technique that balances parameter efficiency, adaptability, and robustness without compromising performance. By strategically sharing the low-rank weight matrices across different layers, ShareLoRA achieves 44\% to 96\% reduction in trainable parameters compared to standard LoRA, alongside a substantial decrease in memory overhead. This efficiency gain scales with model size, making ShareLoRA particularly advantageous for resource-constrained environments. Importantly, ShareLoRA not only maintains model performance but also exhibits robustness in both classification and generation tasks across diverse models, including RoBERTa, GPT-2, and LLaMA series (1, 2, and 3). It consistently outperforms LoRA in zero-shot, few-shot, and continual fine-tuning scenarios, achieving up to 1.2\% average accuracy improvement, and enhanced generalization across domains. In continual learning settings, ShareLoRA achieves 1.2\% higher accuracy on GSM8K, 0.6\% on HumanEval, and 0.5\% on both MMLU and MMLU-Pro. Our results demonstrate that ShareLoRA supports high-quality fine-tuning while offering strong generalization and continual adaptation across various model scales and diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Pruning via Merging: Compressing LLMs via Manifold Alignment Based Layer Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in many domains, their complexity and scale challenge deployment in resource-limited environments. Current compression techniques, such as parameter pruning, often fail to effectively utilize the knowledge from pruned parameters. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Based Knowledge Alignment and Layer Merging Compression (MKA), a novel approach that uses manifold learning and the Normalized Pairwise Information Bottleneck (NPIB) measure to merge similar layers, reducing model size while preserving essential performance. We evaluate MKA on multiple benchmark datasets and various LLMs. Our findings show that MKA not only preserves model performance but also achieves substantial compression ratios, outperforming traditional pruning methods. Moreover, when coupled with quantization, MKA delivers even greater compression. Specifically, on the MMLU dataset using the Llama3-8B model, MKA achieves a compression ratio of 43.75% with a minimal performance decrease of only 2.82\%. The proposed MKA method offers a resource-efficient and performance-preserving model compression technique for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Brittle Minds, Fixable Activations: Understanding Belief Representations in Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks for evaluating language models (LMs), little is known about how LMs internally represent mental states of self and others. Understanding these internal mechanisms is critical - not only to move beyond surface-level performance, but also for model alignment and safety, where subtle misattributions of mental states may go undetected in generated outputs. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation of belief representations in LMs by probing models across different scales, training regimens, and prompts - using control tasks to rule out confounds. Our experiments provide evidence that both model size and fine-tuning substantially improve LMs' internal representations of others' beliefs, which are structured - not mere by-products of spurious correlations - yet brittle to prompt variations. Crucially, we show that these representations can be strengthened: targeted edits to model activations can correct wrong ToM inferences.</description>

      <title>DiffuseDef: Improved Robustness to Adversarial Attacks via Iterative Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained language models have significantly advanced performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, adversarial attacks continue to pose a critical challenge to systems built using these models, as they can be exploited with carefully crafted adversarial texts. Inspired by the ability of diffusion models to predict and reduce noise in computer vision, we propose a novel and flexible adversarial defense method for language classification tasks, DiffuseDef, which incorporates a diffusion layer as a denoiser between the encoder and the classifier. The diffusion layer is trained on top of the existing classifier, ensuring seamless integration with any model in a plug-and-play manner. During inference, the adversarial hidden state is first combined with sampled noise, then denoised iteratively and finally ensembled to produce a robust text representation. By integrating adversarial training, denoising, and ensembling techniques, we show that DiffuseDef improves over existing adversarial defense methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance against common black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>A Bounding Box is Worth One Token: Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model for Document Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, many studies have demonstrated that exclusively incorporating OCR-derived text and spatial layouts with large language models (LLMs) can be highly effective for document understanding tasks. However, existing methods that integrate spatial layouts with text have limitations, such as producing overly long text sequences or failing to fully leverage the autoregressive traits of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model (LayTextLLM)} for document understanding. LayTextLLM projects each bounding box to a single embedding and interleaves it with text, efficiently avoiding long sequence issues while leveraging autoregressive traits of LLMs. LayTextLLM not only streamlines the interaction of layout and textual data but also shows enhanced performance in KIE and VQA. Comprehensive benchmark evaluations reveal significant improvements of LayTextLLM, with a 15.2% increase on KIE tasks and 10.7% on VQA tasks compared to previous SOTA OCR-based LLMs. All resources are available at https://github.com/LayTextLLM/LayTextLLM.</description>

      <title>ClinicRealm: Re-evaluating Large Language Models with Conventional Machine Learning for Non-Generative Clinical Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medicine. However, their utility in non-generative clinical prediction, often presumed inferior to specialized models, remains under-evaluated, leading to ongoing debate within the field and potential for misuse, misunderstanding, or over-reliance due to a lack of systematic benchmarking. Our ClinicRealm study addresses this by benchmarking 9 GPT-based LLMs, 5 BERT-based models, and 7 traditional methods on unstructured clinical notes and structured Electronic Health Records (EHR). Key findings reveal a significant shift: for clinical note predictions, leading LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek R1/V3, GPT o3-mini-high) in zero-shot settings now decisively outperform finetuned BERT models. On structured EHRs, while specialized models excel with ample data, advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek R1/V3) show potent zero-shot capabilities, often surpassing conventional models in data-scarce settings. Notably, leading open-source LLMs can match or exceed proprietary counterparts. These results establish modern LLMs as powerful non-generative clinical prediction tools, particularly with unstructured text and offering data-efficient structured data options, thus necessitating a re-evaluation of model selection strategies. This research should serve as an important insight for medical informaticists, AI developers, and clinical researchers, potentially prompting a reassessment of current assumptions and inspiring new approaches to LLM application in predictive healthcare.</description>

      <title>SWIFT:A Scalable lightWeight Infrastructure for Fine-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent development in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have leverage Attention-based Transformer architectures and achieved superior performance and generalization capabilities. They have since covered extensive areas of traditional learning tasks. For instance, text-based tasks such as text-classification and sequence-labeling, as well as multi-modal tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which were previously addressed using different models, can now be tackled based on one foundation model. Consequently, the training and lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs and MLLMs, especially those based on Transformer architecture, has become particularly important. In recognition of these overwhelming needs, we develop SWIFT, a customizable one-stop infrastructure for large models. With support of over $300+$ LLMs and $50+$ MLLMs, SWIFT stands as the open-source framework that provide the most comprehensive support for fine-tuning large models. In particular, it is the first training framework that provides systematic support for MLLMs. In addition to the core functionalities of fine-tuning, SWIFT also integrates post-training processes such as inference, evaluation, and model quantization, to facilitate fast adoptions of large models in various application scenarios. With a systematic integration of various training techniques, SWIFT offers helpful utilities such as benchmark comparisons among different training techniques for large models. For fine-tuning models specialized in agent framework, we show that notable improvements on the ToolBench leader-board can be achieved by training with customized dataset on SWIFT, with an increase of 5.2%-21.8% in the Act.EM metric over various baseline models, a reduction in hallucination by 1.6%-14.1%, and an average performance improvement of 8%-17%.</description>

      <title>Turning Trash into Treasure: Accelerating Inference of Large Language Models with Token Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive parameters of LLMs have made inference latency a fundamental bottleneck. Speculative decoding represents a lossless approach to accelerate inference through a guess-and-verify paradigm. Some methods rely on additional architectures to guess draft tokens, which need extra training before use. Alternatively, retrieval-based training-free techniques build libraries from pre-existing corpora or by n-gram generation. However, they face challenges like large storage requirements, time-consuming retrieval, and limited adaptability. Observing that candidate tokens generated during the decoding process are likely to reoccur in future sequences, we propose Token Recycling. It stores candidate tokens in an adjacency matrix and employs a breadth-first-search (BFS)-like algorithm to construct a draft tree, which is then validated through tree attention. New candidate tokens from the decoding process are then used to update the matrix. Token Recycling requires \textless2MB of additional storage and achieves approximately 2x speedup across all sizes of LLMs. It significantly outperforms existing train-free methods by 30\% and even a widely recognized training method by 25\%.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Might Not Care What You Are Saying: Prompt Format Beats Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08780v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the help of in-context learning (ICL), large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various tasks. However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL performance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since it could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble framework on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions. Our code will be publicly available once this paper is published.</description>

      <title>LLMs are not Zero-Shot Reasoners for Biomedical Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for applications in healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as question answering and document summarisation. Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extraction. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge. To this end, we evaluate various open LLMs - including BioMistral and Llama-2 models - on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain of-Thought (CoT) and Self Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed and Wikipedia corpora. Counter intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the biomedical domain. Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are required. This highlights the need for more effective integration of external knowledge and reasoning mechanisms in LLMs to enhance their performance in real-world biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>What are the Essential Factors in Crafting Effective Long Context Multi-Hop Instruction Datasets? Insights and Best Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have significantly improved tasks such as information extraction, question answering, and complex planning scenarios. In order to achieve success in long context tasks, a large amount of work has been done to enhance the long context capabilities of the model through synthetic data. Existing methods typically utilize the Self-Instruct framework to generate instruction tuning data for better long context capability improvement. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that less than 35% of generated samples are multi-hop, and more than 40% exhibit poor quality, limiting comprehensive understanding and further research. To improve the quality of synthetic data, we propose the Multi-agent Interactive Multi-hop Generation (MIMG) framework, incorporating a Quality Verification Agent, a Single-hop Question Generation Agent, a Multiple Question Sampling Strategy, and a Multi-hop Question Merger Agent. This framework improves the data quality, with the proportion of high-quality, multi-hop, and diverse data exceeding 85%. Furthermore, we systematically investigate strategies for document selection, question merging, and validation techniques through extensive experiments across various models. Our findings show that our synthetic high-quality long-context instruction data significantly enhances model performance, even surpassing models trained on larger amounts of human-annotated data.

      <title>Learning Efficient Recursive Numeral Systems via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has previously been shown that by using reinforcement learning (RL), agents can derive simple approximate and exact-restricted numeral systems that are similar to human ones (Carlsson, 2021). However, it is a major challenge to show how more complex recursive numeral systems, similar to for example English, could arise via a simple learning mechanism such as RL. Here, we introduce an approach towards deriving a mechanistic explanation of the emergence of efficient recursive number systems. We consider pairs of agents learning how to communicate about numerical quantities through a meta-grammar that can be gradually modified throughout the interactions. Utilising a slightly modified version of the meta-grammar of Hurford (1975), we demonstrate that our RL agents, shaped by the pressures for efficient communication, can effectively modify their lexicon towards Pareto-optimal configurations which are comparable to those observed within human numeral systems in terms of their efficiency.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Trade-Offs: Quantization Methods, Task Difficulty, and Model Size in Large Language Models From Edge to Giant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11055v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantization has gained attention as a promising solution for the cost-effective deployment of large and small language models. However, most prior work has been limited to perplexity or basic knowledge tasks and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of recent models like Llama-3.3. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuned models spanning 1B to 405B parameters, applying four quantization methods across 13 datasets. Our findings reveal that (1) quantized models generally surpass smaller FP16 baselines, yet they often struggle with instruction-following and hallucination detection; (2) FP8 consistently emerges as the most robust option across tasks, and AWQ tends to outperform GPTQ in weight-only quantization; (3) smaller models can suffer severe accuracy drops at 4-bit quantization, while 70B-scale models maintain stable performance; (4) notably, \textit{hard} tasks do not always experience the largest accuracy losses, indicating that quantization magnifies a model's inherent weaknesses rather than simply correlating with task difficulty; and (5) an LLM-based judge (MT-Bench) highlights significant performance declines in Coding and STEM tasks, though it occasionally reports improvements in reasoning.</description>

      <title>PACE: Abstractions for Communicating Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central but unresolved aspect of problem-solving in AI is the capability to introduce and use abstractions, something humans excel at. Work in cognitive science has demonstrated that humans tend towards higher levels of abstraction when engaged in collaborative task-oriented communication, enabling gradually shorter and more information-efficient utterances. Several computational methods have attempted to replicate this phenomenon, but all make unrealistic simplifying assumptions about how abstractions are introduced and learned. Our method, Procedural Abstractions for Communicating Efficiently (PACE), overcomes these limitations through a neuro-symbolic approach. On the symbolic side, we draw on work from library learning for proposing abstractions. We combine this with neural methods for communication and reinforcement learning, via a novel use of bandit algorithms for controlling the exploration and exploitation trade-off in introducing new abstractions. PACE exhibits similar tendencies to humans on a collaborative construction task from the cognitive science literature, where one agent (the architect) instructs the other (the builder) to reconstruct a scene of block-buildings. PACE results in the emergence of an efficient language as a by-product of collaborative communication. Beyond providing mechanistic insights into human communication, our work serves as a first step to providing conversational agents with the ability for human-like communicative abstractions.</description>

      <title>SSR: Alignment-Aware Modality Connector for Speech Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fusing speech into pre-trained language model (SpeechLM) usually suffers from inefficient encoding of long-form speech and catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained text modality. We propose SSR-Connector (Segmented Speech Representation Connector) for better modality fusion. Leveraging speech-text alignments, our approach segments and compresses speech features to match the granularity of text embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training pipeline that includes the distillation and fine-tuning phases to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. SSR-Connector outperforms existing mechanism for speech-text modality fusion, consistently achieving better speech understanding (e.g., +10 accuracy on StoryCloze and +20 on Speech-MMLU) while preserving pre-trained text ability.</description>

      <title>LLMs Know More Than They Show: On the Intrinsic Representation of LLM Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce errors, including factual inaccuracies, biases, and reasoning failures, collectively referred to as "hallucinations". Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs' internal states encode information regarding the truthfulness of their outputs, and that this information can be utilized to detect errors. In this work, we show that the internal representations of LLMs encode much more information about truthfulness than previously recognized. We first discover that the truthfulness information is concentrated in specific tokens, and leveraging this property significantly enhances error detection performance. Yet, we show that such error detectors fail to generalize across datasets, implying that -- contrary to prior claims -- truthfulness encoding is not universal but rather multifaceted. Next, we show that internal representations can also be used for predicting the types of errors the model is likely to make, facilitating the development of tailored mitigation strategies. Lastly, we reveal a discrepancy between LLMs' internal encoding and external behavior: they may encode the correct answer, yet consistently generate an incorrect one. Taken together, these insights deepen our understanding of LLM errors from the model's internal perspective, which can guide future research on enhancing error analysis and mitigation.</description>

      <title>Rodimus*: Breaking the Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-Off with Efficient Attentions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have set new standards in natural language processing. However, the classical softmax attention incurs significant computational costs, leading to a $O(T)$ complexity for per-token generation, where $T$ represents the context length. This work explores reducing LLMs' complexity while maintaining performance by introducing Rodimus and its enhanced version, Rodimus$+$. Rodimus employs an innovative data-dependent tempered selection (DDTS) mechanism within a linear attention-based, purely recurrent framework, achieving significant accuracy while drastically reducing the memory usage typically associated with recurrent models. This method exemplifies semantic compression by maintaining essential input information with fixed-size hidden states. Building on this, Rodimus$+$ combines Rodimus with the innovative Sliding Window Shared-Key Attention (SW-SKA) in a hybrid approach, effectively leveraging the complementary semantic, token, and head compression techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that Rodimus$+$-1.6B, trained on 1 trillion tokens, achieves superior downstream performance against models trained on more tokens, including Qwen2-1.5B and RWKV6-1.6B, underscoring its potential to redefine the accuracy-efficiency balance in LLMs. Model code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/codefuse-ai/rodimus.</description>

      <title>MOOSE-Chem: Large Language Models for Rediscovering Unseen Chemistry Scientific Hypotheses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07076v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific discovery plays a pivotal role in advancing human society, and recent progress in large language models (LLMs) suggests their potential to accelerate this process. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can autonomously generate novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can discover high-quality chemistry hypotheses given only a research background-comprising a question and/or a survey-without restriction on the domain of the question. We begin with the observation that hypothesis discovery is a seemingly intractable task. To address this, we propose a formal mathematical decomposition grounded in a fundamental assumption: that most chemistry hypotheses can be composed from a research background and a set of inspirations. This decomposition leads to three practical subtasks-retrieving inspirations, composing hypotheses with inspirations, and ranking hypotheses - which together constitute a sufficient set of subtasks for the overall scientific discovery task. We further develop an agentic LLM framework, MOOSE-Chem, that is a direct implementation of this mathematical decomposition. To evaluate this framework, we construct a benchmark of 51 high-impact chemistry papers published and online after January 2024, each manually annotated by PhD chemists with background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The framework is able to rediscover many hypotheses with high similarity to the groundtruth, successfully capturing the core innovations-while ensuring no data contamination since it uses an LLM with knowledge cutoff date prior to 2024. Finally, based on LLM's surprisingly high accuracy on inspiration retrieval, a task with inherently out-of-distribution nature, we propose a bold assumption: that LLMs may already encode latent scientific knowledge associations not yet recognized by humans.</description>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, traditional evaluation metrics tend to saturate, making it challenging to distinguish between models. We propose a general method to transform existing LLM evaluations into a series of progressively more difficult tasks. These enhanced evaluations emphasize reasoning capabilities and can reveal relative performance differences that are not apparent in the original assessments.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we create a new multiple-choice test corpus, extend it into a family of evaluations, and assess a collection of LLMs. Our results offer insights into the comparative abilities of these models, particularly highlighting the differences between base LLMs and more recent "reasoning" models.</description>

      <title>VersaTune: An Efficient Data Composition Framework for Training Multi-Capability LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11266v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As demonstrated by the proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and Claude series, LLMs have the potential to achieve remarkable proficiency across a wide range of domains, including law, medicine, finance, science, code, etc., all within a single model. These capabilities are further augmented during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase. Despite their potential, existing work mainly focuses on domain-specific enhancements during fine-tuning, the challenge of which lies in catastrophic forgetting of knowledge across other domains. In this study, we introduce **VersaTune**, a novel data composition framework designed for enhancing LLMs' overall multi-domain capabilities during training. We begin with detecting the distribution of domain-specific knowledge within the base model, followed by the training data composition that aligns with the model's existing knowledge distribution. During the subsequent training process, domain weights are dynamically adjusted based on their learnable potential and forgetting degree. Experimental results indicate that VersaTune is effective in multi-domain fostering, with an improvement of 35.21\% in the overall multi-ability performances compared to uniform domain weights. Furthermore, we find that Qwen-2.5-32B + VersaTune even surpasses frontier models, including GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet and DeepSeek-V3 by 0.86\%, 4.76\% and 4.60\%. Additionally, in scenarios where flexible expansion of a specific domain is required, VersaTune reduces the performance degradation in other domains by 38.77\%, while preserving the training efficacy of the target domain.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.</description>

      <title>Simple and Provable Scaling Laws for the Test-Time Compute of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19477v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two simple, principled and practical algorithms that enjoy provable scaling laws for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them via a knockout tournament for the final output. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure probability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute. Both algorithms require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation, which makes them appealing for practical applications and easy to adapt for different tasks. Through extensive experiments with diverse models and datasets, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.</description>

      <title>Can ChatGPT capture swearing nuances? Evidence from translating Arabic oaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study sets out to answer one major question: Can ChatGPT capture swearing nuances? It presents an empirical study on the ability of ChatGPT to translate Arabic oath expressions into English. 30 Arabic oath expressions were collected from the literature. These 30 oaths were first translated via ChatGPT and then analyzed and compared to the human translation in terms of types of gaps left unfulfilled by ChatGPT. Specifically, the gaps involved are: religious gap, cultural gap, both religious and cultural gaps, no gap, using non-oath particles, redundancy and noncapturing of Arabic script diacritics. It concludes that ChatGPT translation of oaths is still much unsatisfactory, unveiling the need of further developments of ChatGPT, and the inclusion of Arabic data on which ChatGPT should be trained including oath expressions, oath nuances, rituals, and practices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding user intentions is challenging for online platforms. Recent work on intention knowledge graphs addresses this but often lacks focus on connecting intentions, which is crucial for modeling user behavior and predicting future actions. This paper introduces a framework to automatically generate an intention knowledge graph, capturing connections between user intentions. Using the Amazon m2 dataset, we construct an intention graph with 351 million edges, demonstrating high plausibility and acceptance. Our model effectively predicts new session intentions and enhances product recommendations, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods and showcasing the approach's practical utility.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Proof that Auto-regressive Language Models Collapse when Real-world Data is a Finite Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auto-regressive language models (LMs) have been widely used to generate data in data-scarce domains to train new LMs, compensating for the scarcity of real-world data. Previous work experimentally found that LMs collapse when trained on recursively generated data. This paper presents a theoretical proof: once a corpus (such as a subset of the World Wide Web) begins to incorporate generated data and no new real-world data is added to the corpus, then no matter how small the amount of data each LM generates and contributes to the corpus, LM collapse is inevitable after sufficient time. This finding suggests that attempts to mitigate collapse by limiting the quantity of synthetic data in the corpus are fundamentally insufficient. Instead, avoiding collapse hinges on ensuring the quality of synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Sampling: Scaling Inference Compute for Data Synthesis with Tree Search-Based Agentic Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling laws for inference compute in multi-agent systems remain under-explored compared to single-agent scenarios. This work aims to bridge this gap by investigating the problem of data synthesis through multi-agent sampling, where synthetic responses are generated by sampling from multiple distinct language models. Effective model coordination is crucial for successful multi-agent collaboration. Unlike previous approaches that rely on fixed workflows, we treat model coordination as a multi-step decision-making process, optimizing generation structures dynamically for each input question. We introduce Tree Search-based Orchestrated Agents~(TOA), where the workflow evolves iteratively during the sequential sampling process. To achieve this, we leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), integrating a reward model to provide real-time feedback and accelerate exploration. Our experiments on alignment, machine translation, and mathematical reasoning demonstrate that multi-agent sampling significantly outperforms single-agent sampling as inference compute scales. TOA is the most compute-efficient approach, achieving SOTA performance on WMT and a 72.2\% LC win rate on AlpacaEval. Moreover, fine-tuning with our synthesized alignment data surpasses strong preference learning methods on challenging benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and AlpacaEval.</description>

      <title>ToolHop: A Query-Driven Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Multi-Hop Tool Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective evaluation of multi-hop tool use is critical for analyzing the understanding, reasoning, and function-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches. Code and data can be found in https://huggingface.co/datasets/bytedance-research/ToolHop.</description>

      <title>Can MLLMs Generalize to Multi-Party dialog? Exploring Multilingual Response Generation in Complex Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current multilingual large language models(MLLMs) still focus on simple question-answering formats, often overlooking more complex dialogue scenarios. In other words, their capabilities of multilingual large models have yet to be validated in dialogue tasks with intricate structures. We therefore ask, Q1: How well do LLMs generalize to more complex dialog scenarios? Q2: Can supervised fine-tuning on a high-quality parallel benchmark restore this ability? Q3: Does the "multilingual complementarity" effect survive in the setting? To answer these questions, we introduce XMP, a high-quality parallel Multilingual dataset sourced from Multi-party Podcast dialogues, which is the first parallel dataset focusing on multi-party dialogue scenarios. Most samples in the dataset feature three or more participants, discussing a wide range of topics. Through extensive experiments, we find that, R1: MLLMs fail to generalize to multi-party setting, R2 Fine-tuning on XMP improves only marginally, with the 70B model achieving at most a 1% absolute gain over its 8B counterpart; R3: Mixing languages during SFT is usually detrimental, with any benefits being marginal and limited to isolated cases in the 70B model.</description>

      <title>Advancing Multi-Party Dialogue Framework with Speaker-ware Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-party dialogues, common in collaborative scenarios like brainstorming sessions and negotiations, pose significant challenges due to their complexity and diverse speaker roles. Current methods often use graph neural networks to model dialogue context, capturing structural dynamics but heavily relying on annotated graph structures and overlooking individual speaking styles. To address these challenges, we propose CMR, a Contrastive learning-based Multi-party dialogue Response generation framework. CMR employs a two-stage self-supervised contrastive learning framework. First, it captures global differences in speaking styles across individuals. Then, it focuses on intra-conversation comparisons to identify thematic transitions and contextually relevant facts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that applies contrastive learning in multi-party dialogue generation. Experimental results demonstrate that CMR not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also generalizes well to large pre-trained language models, effectively enhancing their capability in handling multi-party conversations.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Large Language Models in Language Preservation: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global crisis of language endangerment meets a technological turning point as Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) unlock new frontiers in automating corpus creation, transcription, translation, and tutoring. However, this promise is imperiled by fragmented practices and the critical lack of a methodology to navigate the fraught balance between LLM capabilities and the profound risks of data scarcity, cultural misappropriation, and ethical missteps. This paper introduces a novel analytical framework that systematically evaluates GenAI applications against language-specific needs, embedding community governance and ethical safeguards as foundational pillars. We demonstrate its efficacy through the Te Reo M\=aori revitalization, where it illuminates successes, such as community-led Automatic Speech Recognition achieving 92% accuracy, while critically surfacing persistent challenges in data sovereignty and model bias for digital archives and educational tools. Our findings underscore that GenAI can indeed revolutionize language preservation, but only when interventions are rigorously anchored in community-centric data stewardship, continuous evaluation, and transparent risk management. Ultimately, this framework provides an indispensable toolkit for researchers, language communities, and policymakers, aiming to catalyze the ethical and high-impact deployment of LLMs to safeguard the world's linguistic heritage.</description>

      <title>AdaServe: Accelerating Multi-SLO LLM Serving with SLO-Customized Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) applications exhibit diverse service-level objectives (SLOs), from low-latency requirements in interactive coding assistants to more relaxed constraints in data wrangling tasks. Existing LLM serving systems, which rely on uniform batching and scheduling strategies, often fail to meet these heterogeneous SLOs concurrently. We present AdaServe, the first LLM serving system designed to support efficient multi-SLO serving through SLO-customized speculative decoding. AdaServe formulates multi-SLO serving as a constrained optimization problem and introduces a hardware-aware algorithm that constructs a speculation tree tailored to each request's latency target. It features a speculate-select-verify pipeline that enables fine-grained control over decoding speed while maximizing system throughput. AdaServe further adapts to workload variation by dynamically adjusting speculation parameters. Evaluations across diverse workloads show that AdaServe reduces SLO violations by up to 4.3$\times$ and improves goodput by up to 1.9$\times$ compared to the best performing baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in multi-SLO serving.</description>

      <title>Option-ID Based Elimination For Multiple Choice Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are a popular and important task for evaluating large language models (LLMs). Based on common strategies people use when answering MCQs, the process of elimination (PoE) has been proposed as an effective problem-solving method. Existing PoE methods typically either have LLMs directly identify incorrect options or score options and replace lower-scoring ones with [MASK]. However, both methods suffer from inapplicability or suboptimal performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel option-ID based PoE ($\text{PoE}_{\text{ID}}$). $\text{PoE}_{\text{ID}}$ critically incorporates a debiasing technique to counteract LLMs token bias, enhancing robustness over naive ID-based elimination. It features two strategies: $\text{PoE}_{\text{ID}}^{\text{log}}$, which eliminates options whose IDs have log probabilities below the average threshold, and $\text{PoE}_{\text{ID}}^{\text{seq}}$, which iteratively removes the option with the lowest ID probability. We conduct extensive experiments with 6 different LLMs on 4 diverse datasets. The results demonstrate that $\text{PoE}_{\text{ID}}$, especially $\text{PoE}_{\text{ID}}^{\text{log}}$, significantly improves zero-shot and few-shot MCQs performance, particularly in datasets with more options. Our analyses demonstrate that $\text{PoE}_{\text{ID}}^{\text{log}}$ enhances the LLMs' confidence in selecting the correct option, and the option elimination strategy outperforms methods relying on [MASK] replacement. We further investigate the limitations of LLMs in directly identifying incorrect options, which stem from their inherent deficiencies.</description>

      <title>How Linguistics Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models can produce fluent, grammatical text. Nonetheless, some maintain that language models don't really learn language and also that, even if they did, that would not be informative for the study of human learning and processing. On the other side, there have been claims that the success of LMs obviates the need for studying linguistic theory and structure. We argue that both extremes are wrong. LMs can contribute to fundamental questions about linguistic structure, language processing, and learning. They force us to rethink arguments and ways of thinking that have been foundational in linguistics. While they do not replace linguistic structure and theory, they serve as model systems and working proofs of concept for gradient, usage-based approaches to language. We offer an optimistic take on the relationship between language models and linguistics.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking LLMs' Safeguard with Universal Magic Words for Text Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The security issue of large language models (LLMs) has gained wide attention recently, with various defense mechanisms developed to prevent harmful output, among which safeguards based on text embedding models serve as a fundamental defense. Through testing, we discover that the output distribution of text embedding models is severely biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel, efficient methods to search for **universal magic words** that attack text embedding models. Universal magic words as suffixes can shift the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, thus manipulating the similarity of any text pair and misleading safeguards. Attackers can jailbreak the safeguards by appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words. Experiments show that magic word attacks significantly degrade safeguard performance on JailbreakBench, cause real-world chatbots to produce harmful outputs in full-pipeline attacks, and generalize across input/output texts, models, and languages. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense methods against such attacks, which can correct the bias of text embeddings and improve downstream performance in a train-free manner.</description>

      <title>Vision-centric Token Compression in Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world applications are stretching context windows to hundreds of thousand of tokens while Large Language Models (LLMs) swell from billions to trillions of parameters. This dual expansion send compute and memory costs skyrocketing, making token compression indispensable. We introduce Vision Centric Token Compression (Vist), a slow-fast compression framework that mirrors human reading: the fast path renders distant tokens into images, letting a frozen, lightweight vision encoder skim the low-salience context; the slow path feeds the proximal window into the LLM for fine-grained reasoning. A Probability-Informed Visual Enhancement (PVE) objective masks high-frequency tokens during training, steering the Resampler to concentrate on semantically rich regions-just as skilled reader gloss over function words. On eleven in-context learning benchmarks, Vist achieves the same accuracy with 2.3 times fewer tokens, cutting FLOPs by 16% and memory by 50%. This method delivers remarkable results, outperforming the strongest text encoder-based compression method CEPE by 7.6% on average over benchmarks like TriviaQA, NQ, PopQA, NLUI, and CLIN, setting a new standard for token efficiency in LLMs. The source code will be released.</description>

      <title>Joint Localization and Activation Editing for Low-Resource Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, are commonly used to adapt LLMs. However, the effectiveness of standard PEFT methods is limited in low-resource scenarios with only a few hundred examples. Recent advances in interpretability research have inspired the emergence of activation editing (or steering) techniques, which modify the activations of specific model components. These methods, due to their extremely small parameter counts, show promise for small datasets. However, their performance is highly dependent on identifying the correct modules to edit and often lacks stability across different datasets. In this paper, we propose Joint Localization and Activation Editing (JoLA), a method that jointly learns (1) which heads in the Transformer to edit (2) whether the intervention should be additive, multiplicative, or both and (3) the intervention parameters themselves - the vectors applied as additive offsets or multiplicative scalings to the head output. Through evaluations on three benchmarks spanning commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding, and natural language generation, we demonstrate that JoLA consistently outperforms existing methods. The code for the method is released at https://github.com/wenlai-lavine/jola.</description>

      <title>Scaling Embedding Layers in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose SCONE ($S$calable, $C$ontextualized, $O$ffloaded, $N$-gram $E$mbedding), a new method for extending input embedding layers to enhance language model performance. To avoid increased decoding costs, SCONE retains the original vocabulary while introducing embeddings for a set of frequent $n$-grams. These embeddings provide contextualized representation for each input token and are learned with a separate model during training. After training, embeddings are precomputed and stored in off-accelerator memory; during inference, querying them has minimal impact on latency due to the low complexity of embedding lookups. SCONE enables two new scaling strategies: increasing the number of $n$-gram embeddings and scaling the model used to learn them, both while maintaining fixed accelerator usage during inference (in terms of FLOPS and memory). We show that scaling both aspects enables a model with 1B accelerator-resident parameters to outperform a 1.9B-parameter baseline across diverse corpora, while using only about half the FLOPS and accelerator memory during inference.</description>

      <title>Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach for Constructing Value Systems in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Values are core drivers of individual and collective perception, cognition, and behavior. Value systems, such as Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, delineate the hierarchy and interplay among these values, enabling cross-disciplinary investigations into decision-making and societal dynamics. Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding their elusive intrinsic values. Despite growing efforts in evaluating, understanding, and aligning LLM values, a psychologically grounded LLM value system remains underexplored. This study addresses the gap by introducing the Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach (GPLA), a scalable, adaptable, and theoretically informed method for constructing value systems. Leveraging GPLA, we propose a psychologically grounded five-factor value system tailored for LLMs. For systematic validation, we present three benchmarking tasks that integrate psychological principles with cutting-edge AI priorities. Our results reveal that the proposed value system meets standard psychological criteria, better captures LLM values, improves LLM safety prediction, and enhances LLM alignment, when compared to the canonical Schwartz's values.</description>

      <title>Reformulation for Pretraining Data Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models across various tasks, their continued scaling is severely hampered not only by data scarcity but also by the performance degradation associated with excessive data repetition during training. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we propose the Massive Genre-Audience(MGA) reformulation method, a lightweight and scalable data augmentation technique inspired by synthetic data methodologies. MGA systematically reformulates existing corpora into diverse, contextually-rich variations to mitigate the negative effects of repetition, and we introduce this approach along with the resulting 770 billion token MGACorpus in this work. We experimentally validate its core benefit by demonstrating superior performance against data repetition and upsampling in scaling scenarios (up to 13B parameters). Furthermore, comprehensive analysis investigates the role of prompt engineering in generation quality and reveals nuances in evaluating model capabilities using standard loss metrics. Our work shows that MGA provides a reliable pathway to substantially augment training datasets, effectively alleviating repetition bottlenecks and enabling more efficient scaling of large language models.</description>

      <title>ATLAS: Autoformalizing Theorems through Lifting, Augmentation, and Synthesis of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoformalization, the automatic translation of mathematical content from natural language into machine-verifiable formal languages, has seen significant progress driven by advances in large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, a primary barrier to further improvements is the limited availability of parallel corpora that map informal mathematical text to its formal counterpart. To address this limitation, we propose ATLAS (Autoformalizing Theorems through Lifting, Augmentation, and Synthesis of Data), a novel data generation framework designed to produce large-scale, high-quality parallel corpora of theorem statements. Distinct from prior approaches, ATLAS begins with a concept repository, accelerates the improvement of student model through expert iteration combined with knowledge distillation, and introduces two novel augmentation strategies that exploit the structural characteristics of formal languages. With the proposed ATLAS running for 10 iterations, we construct an undergraduate-level dataset comprising 117k theorem statements and develop ATLAS Translator, which demonstrates statistically significant improvements over both the HERALD Translator and the Kimina-Autoformalizer across all benchmarks ($p&lt;0.05$, two-sided t-test), achieving a new state of the art. The datasets, model, and code will be released to the public soon.</description>

      <title>Evolving LLMs' Self-Refinement Capability via Iterative Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general performance, enabling smaller models to achieve capabilities comparable to their larger counterparts remains a critical challenge. For humans, iterative refinement of problem analysis and responses is a common strategy to enhance answer quality. However, we observe that existing LLMs exhibit limited ability to refine their outputs for quality improvement. In this paper, we first investigate mechanisms to unlock and progressively enhance self-refinement ability in smaller models within an iterative preference optimization framework, aiming to bridge the performance gap with larger models. To this end, we propose EVOLVE, a novel post-training and inference framework that iteratively integrates preference training with self-refinement-driven data collection. During training, EVOLVE strengthens the model's direct question-answering ability while simultaneously unlocking its self-refinement potential. At inference, the framework leverages this capability to generate progressively refined responses, which are filtered to construct datasets for subsequent rounds of preference training. Experiments demonstrate EVOLVE's exceptional performance: when applied to Llama-3.1-8B base model and under the self-refinement setting, it surpasses state-of-the-art models including Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct and GPT-4o, achieving a 62.3% length-controlled win rate and 63.3% raw win rate on AlpacaEval 2, along with a 50.3% win rate on Arena-Hard. Furthermore, EVOLVE consistently enhances performance on mathematical reasoning tasks like GSM8K and MATH.</description>

      <title>Is LLM an Overconfident Judge? Unveiling the Capabilities of LLMs in Detecting Offensive Language with Annotation Disagreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential for offensive language detection, yet their ability to handle annotation disagreement remains underexplored. Disagreement samples, which arise from subjective interpretations, pose a unique challenge due to their ambiguous nature. Understanding how LLMs process these cases, particularly their confidence levels, can offer insight into their alignment with human annotators. This study systematically evaluates the performance of multiple LLMs in detecting offensive language at varying levels of annotation agreement. We analyze binary classification accuracy, examine the relationship between model confidence and human disagreement, and explore how disagreement samples influence model decision-making during few-shot learning and instruction fine-tuning. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle with low-agreement samples, often exhibiting overconfidence in these ambiguous cases. However, utilizing disagreement samples in training improves both detection accuracy and model alignment with human judgment. These insights provide a foundation for enhancing LLM-based offensive language detection in real-world moderation tasks.</description>

      <title>Who Taught You That? Tracing Teachers in Model Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model distillation -- using outputs from a large teacher model to teach a small student model -- is a practical means of creating efficient models for a particular task. We ask: Can we identify a students' teacher based on its outputs? Such "footprints" left by teacher LLMs would be interesting artifacts. Beyond this, reliable teacher inference may have practical implications as actors seek to distill specific capabilities of massive proprietary LLMs into deployed smaller LMs, potentially violating terms of service. We consider practical task distillation targets including summarization, question answering, and instruction-following. We assume a finite set of candidate teacher models, which we treat as blackboxes. We design discriminative models that operate over lexical features. We find that $n$-gram similarity alone is unreliable for identifying teachers, but part-of-speech (PoS) templates preferred by student models mimic those of their teachers.</description>

      <title>Can Vision-Language Models Infer Speaker's Ignorance? The Role of Visual and Linguistic Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates whether vision-language models (VLMs) can perform pragmatic inference, focusing on ignorance implicatures, utterances that imply the speaker's lack of precise knowledge. To test this, we systematically manipulated contextual cues: the visually depicted situation (visual cue) and QUD-based linguistic prompts (linguistic cue). When only visual cues were provided, three state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 sonnet) produced interpretations largely based on the lexical meaning of the modified numerals. When linguistic cues were added to enhance contextual informativeness, Claude exhibited more human-like inference by integrating both types of contextual cues. In contrast, GPT and Gemini favored precise, literal interpretations. Although the influence of contextual cues increased, they treated each contextual cue independently and aligned them with semantic features rather than engaging in context-driven reasoning. These findings suggest that although the models differ in how they handle contextual cues, Claude's ability to combine multiple cues may signal emerging pragmatic competence in multimodal models.</description>

      <title>RAS: Retrieval-And-Structuring for Knowledge-Intensive LLM Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, yet they often struggle with multi-step reasoning due to the unstructured nature of retrieved context. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods provide external information, the lack of explicit organization among retrieved passages limits their effectiveness, leading to brittle reasoning pathways. Recent interpretability studies highlighting the importance of structured intermediate reasoning further align with this perspective. We propose Retrieval-And-Structuring (RAS), a framework that dynamically constructs query-specific knowledge graphs through iterative retrieval and structured knowledge building. RAS interleaves targeted retrieval planning with incremental graph construction, enabling models to assemble and reason over evolving knowledge structures tailored to each query. On seven knowledge-intensive benchmarks, RAS consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 6.4% and 7.0% gains with open-source and proprietary LLMs, respectively. Our results demonstrate that dynamic, query-specific knowledge structuring offers a robust path to improving reasoning accuracy and robustness in language model generation. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/pat-jj/RAS.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pairwise: Global Zero-shot Temporal Graph Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal relation extraction (TRE) is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying the temporal relationships between events in a document. Despite the advances in large language models (LLMs), their application to TRE remains limited. Most existing approaches rely on pairwise classification, where event pairs are classified in isolation, leading to computational inefficiency and a lack of global consistency in the resulting temporal graph. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot method for TRE that generates a document's complete temporal graph in a single step, followed by temporal constraint optimization to refine predictions and enforce temporal consistency across relations. Additionally, we introduce OmniTemp, a new dataset with complete annotations for all pairs of targeted events within a document. Through experiments and analyses, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing zero-shot approaches and offers a competitive alternative to supervised TRE models.</description>

Abstract: Automated text readability prediction is widely used in many real-world scenarios. Over the past century, such measures have primarily been developed and evaluated on reading comprehension outcomes and on human annotations of text readability levels. In this work, we propose an alternative, eye tracking-based cognitive framework which directly taps into a key aspect of readability: reading ease. We use this framework for evaluating a broad range of prominent readability measures, including two systems widely used in education, by quantifying their ability to account for reading facilitation effects in text simplification, as well as text reading ease more broadly. Our analyses suggest that existing readability measures are poor predictors of reading facilitation and reading ease, outperformed by word properties commonly used in psycholinguistics, and in particular by surprisal.</description>

      <title>The Mirage of Model Editing: Revisiting Evaluation in the Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11177v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite near-perfect results in artificial evaluations, the effectiveness of model editing in real-world applications remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose to study model editing in question answering (QA) by establishing a rigorous evaluation practice to assess the effectiveness of editing methods in correcting LLMs' errors. It consists of QAEdit, a new benchmark derived from popular QA datasets, and a standardized evaluation framework. Our single editing experiments indicate that current editing methods perform substantially worse than previously reported (38.5% vs. ~96%). Through module analysis and controlled experiments, we demonstrate that this performance decline stems from issues in evaluation practices of prior editing research. One key issue is the inappropriate use of teacher forcing in testing prevents error propagation by feeding ground truth tokens (inaccessible in real-world scenarios) as input. Furthermore, we simulate real-world deployment by sequential editing, revealing that current approaches fail drastically with only 1000 edits. Our analysis provides a fundamental reexamination of both the real-world applicability of existing model editing methods and their evaluation practices, and establishes a rigorous evaluation framework with key insights to advance reliable and practical model editing research.</description>

      <title>From the New World of Word Embeddings: A Comparative Study of Small-World Lexico-Semantic Networks in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lexico-semantic networks represent words as nodes and their semantic relatedness as edges. While such networks are traditionally constructed using embeddings from encoder-based models or static vectors, embeddings from decoder-only large language models (LLMs) remain underexplored. Unlike encoder models, LLMs are trained with a next-token prediction objective, which does not directly encode the meaning of the current token. In this paper, we construct lexico-semantic networks from the input embeddings of LLMs with varying parameter scales and conduct a comparative analysis of their global and local structures. Our results show that these networks exhibit small-world properties, characterized by high clustering and short path lengths. Moreover, larger LLMs yield more intricate networks with less small-world effects and longer paths, reflecting richer semantic structures and relations. We further validate our approach through analyses of common conceptual pairs, structured lexical relations derived from WordNet, and a cross-lingual semantic network for qualitative words.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Task: Robust Multi-Task Length Generalization for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems longer than those seen during training, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). Previous work modifies positional encodings (PEs) and data formats to improve length generalization on specific symbolic tasks such as addition and sorting. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited to special tasks, often degrading general language performance. Furthermore, they are typically evaluated on small transformers trained from scratch on single tasks and can cause performance drop when applied during post-training stage of practical LLMs with general capabilities. Hu et al., (2024) proposed Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) to improve length generalization in the post-training stage of LLMs. Despite its compatibility with practical models and strong performance, RFFT is proposed for single tasks too, requiring re-training for each individual task with extensive examples. In this paper, we study length generalization in multi-task settings and propose Meta Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (Meta-RFFT), the first framework enabling robust cross-task length generalization. As our first contribution, we construct a large length generalization dataset containing 86 tasks spanning code execution, number processing, symbolic and logical reasoning tasks, beyond the common addition or multiplication tasks. Secondly, we show that cross-task length generalization is possible with Meta-RFFT. After training on a large number of tasks and instances, the models achieve remarkable length generalization ability on unseen tasks with minimal fine-tuning or one-shot prompting. For example, after fine-tuning on 1 to 5 digit addition, our 32B model achieves 95% accuracy on 30 digit addition, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1-671B: 72%), despite never seeing this task during RF-pretraining.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for Persian (Farsi) text embeddings, built upon the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). Our benchmark includes 63 datasets spanning seven different tasks: classification, clustering, pair classification, reranking, retrieval, summary retrieval, and semantic textual similarity. The datasets are formed as a combination of existing, translated, and newly generated data, offering a diverse evaluation framework for Persian language models. Given the increasing use of text embedding models in chatbots, evaluation datasets are becoming inseparable ingredients in chatbot challenges and Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems. As a contribution, we include chatbot evaluation datasets in the MTEB benchmark for the first time. In addition, in this paper, we introduce the new task of summary retrieval which is not part of the tasks included in standard MTEB. Another contribution of this paper is the introduction of a substantial number of new Persian language NLP datasets suitable for training and evaluation, some of which have no previous counterparts in Persian. We evaluate the performance of several Persian and multilingual embedding models in a range of tasks. This work introduces an open-source benchmark with datasets, code and a public leaderboard.</description>

      <title>To Think or Not to Think: Exploring the Unthinking Vulnerability in Large Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are designed to solve complex tasks by generating explicit reasoning traces before producing final answers. However, we reveal a critical vulnerability in LRMs -- termed Unthinking Vulnerability -- wherein the thinking process can be bypassed by manipulating special delimiter tokens. It is empirically demonstrated to be widespread across mainstream LRMs, posing both a significant risk and potential utility, depending on how it is exploited. In this paper, we systematically investigate this vulnerability from both malicious and beneficial perspectives. On the malicious side, we introduce Breaking of Thought (BoT), a novel attack that enables adversaries to bypass the thinking process of LRMs, thereby compromising their reliability and availability. We present two variants of BoT: a training-based version that injects backdoor during the fine-tuning stage, and a training-free version based on adversarial attack during the inference stage. As a potential defense, we propose thinking recovery alignment to partially mitigate the vulnerability. On the beneficial side, we introduce Monitoring of Thought (MoT), a plug-and-play framework that allows model owners to enhance efficiency and safety. It is implemented by leveraging the same vulnerability to dynamically terminate redundant or risky reasoning through external monitoring. Extensive experiments show that BoT poses a significant threat to reasoning reliability, while MoT provides a practical solution for preventing overthinking and jailbreaking. Our findings expose an inherent flaw in current LRM architectures and underscore the need for more robust reasoning systems in the future.</description>

      <title>SafeRoute: Adaptive Model Selection for Efficient and Accurate Safety Guardrails in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications requires robust safety guard models to detect and block harmful user prompts. While large safety guard models achieve strong performance, their computational cost is substantial. To mitigate this, smaller distilled models are used, but they often underperform on "hard" examples where the larger model provides accurate predictions. We observe that many inputs can be reliably handled by the smaller model, while only a small fraction require the larger model's capacity. Motivated by this, we propose SafeRoute, a binary router that distinguishes hard examples from easy ones. Our method selectively applies the larger safety guard model to the data that the router considers hard, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy compared to solely using the larger safety guard model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our adaptive model selection significantly enhances the trade-off between computational cost and safety performance, outperforming relevant baselines.</description>

      <title>Is This Collection Worth My LLM's Time? Automatically Measuring Information Potential in Text Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) converge towards similar capabilities, the key to advancing their performance lies in identifying and incorporating valuable new information sources. However, evaluating which text collections are worth the substantial investment required for digitization, preprocessing, and integration into LLM systems remains a significant challenge. We present a novel approach to this challenge: an automated pipeline that evaluates the potential information gain from text collections without requiring model training or fine-tuning. Our method generates multiple choice questions (MCQs) from texts and measures an LLM's performance both with and without access to the source material. The performance gap between these conditions serves as a proxy for the collection's information potential. We validate our approach using five strategically selected datasets: EPFL PhD manuscripts, a private collection of Venetian historical records, two sets of Wikipedia articles on related topics, and a synthetic baseline dataset. Our results demonstrate that this method effectively identifies collections containing valuable novel information, providing a practical tool for prioritizing data acquisition and integration efforts.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability of Text-to-Image Models to Prompt Template Stealing: A Differential Evolution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt trading has emerged as a significant intellectual property concern in recent years, where vendors entice users by showcasing sample images before selling prompt templates that can generate similar images. This work investigates a critical security vulnerability: attackers can steal prompt templates using only a limited number of sample images. To investigate this threat, we introduce Prism, a prompt-stealing benchmark consisting of 50 templates and 450 images, organized into Easy and Hard difficulty levels. To identify the vulnerabity of VLMs to prompt stealing, we propose EvoStealer, a novel template stealing method that operates without model fine-tuning by leveraging differential evolution algorithms. The system first initializes population sets using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on predefined patterns, then iteratively generates enhanced offspring through MLLMs. During evolution, EvoStealer identifies common features across offspring to derive generalized templates. Our comprehensive evaluation conducted across open-source (INTERNVL2-26B) and closed-source models (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) demonstrates that EvoStealer's stolen templates can reproduce images highly similar to originals and effectively generalize to other subjects, significantly outperforming baseline methods with an average improvement of over 10%. Moreover, our cost analysis reveals that EvoStealer achieves template stealing with negligible computational expenses. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/whitepagewu/evostealer.</description>

      <title>Machine-generated text detection prevents language model collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15654v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their generated outputs are proliferating across the web, risking a future where machine-generated content dilutes human-authored text. Since online data is the primary resource for LLM pre-training, subsequent models could be trained on an unknown portion of synthetic samples. This will lead to model collapse, a degenerative process whereby LLMs reinforce their own errors, converge to a low variance output distribution, and ultimately yield a declining performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of decoding strategy on model collapse, analysing the text characteristics at each model generation, the similarity to human references, and the resulting model performance. Using the decoding strategies that lead to the most significant degradation, we evaluate model collapse in more realistic scenarios where the origin of the data (human or synthetic) is unknown. We train a machine-generated text detector and propose an importance sampling approach to alleviate model collapse. Our method is validated on two LLM variants (GPT-2 and SmolLM2), across a range of model sizes (124M to 1.7B), on the open-ended text generation task. We demonstrate that it can not only prevent model collapse but also improve performance when sufficient human-authored samples are present.

      <title>FANformer: Improving Large Language Models Through Effective Periodicity Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodicity, as one of the most important basic characteristics, lays the foundation for facilitating structured knowledge acquisition and systematic cognitive processes within human learning paradigms. However, the potential flaws of periodicity modeling in Transformer affect the learning efficiency and establishment of underlying principles from data for large language models (LLMs) built upon it. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating effective periodicity modeling can improve the learning efficiency and performance of LLMs. We introduce FANformer, which adapts Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) into attention mechanism to achieve efficient periodicity modeling, by modifying the feature projection process of attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on language modeling show that FANformer consistently outperforms Transformer when scaling up model size and training tokens, underscoring its superior learning efficiency. Our pretrained FANformer-1B exhibits marked improvements on downstream tasks compared to open-source LLMs with similar model parameters or training tokens. Moreover, we reveal that FANformer exhibits superior ability to learn and apply rules for reasoning compared to Transformer. The results position FANformer as an effective and promising architecture for advancing LLMs.</description>

      <title>MoSE: Hierarchical Self-Distillation Enhances Early Layer Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deploying language models often requires navigating accuracy vs. performance trade-offs to meet latency constraints while preserving utility. Traditional model distillation reduces size but incurs substantial costs through training separate models. We introduce ModularStarEncoder (MoSE), a 1-billion-parameter multi-exit encoder for code retrieval and classification that employs a novel Self-Distillation mechanism. This approach significantly enhances lower-layer representations, enabling flexible deployment of different model portions with favorable performance trade-offs. Our architecture improves text-to-code and code-to-code search by targeting specific encoder layers as exit heads, where higher layers guide earlier ones during training-improving intermediate representations at minimal additional cost. We further enhance MoSE with a repository-level contextual loss that maximizes training context window utilization. Additionally, we release a new dataset created through code translation that extends text-to-code benchmarks with cross-language code-to-code pairs. Evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Self-Distillation as a principled approach to trading inference cost for accuracy across various code understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>Can Frontier LLMs Replace Annotators in Biomedical Text Mining? Analyzing Challenges and Exploring Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple previous studies have reported suboptimal performance of LLMs in biomedical text mining. By analyzing failure patterns in these evaluations, we identified three primary challenges for LLMs in biomedical corpora: (1) LLMs fail to learn implicit dataset-specific nuances from supervised data, (2) The common formatting requirements of discriminative tasks limit the reasoning capabilities of LLMs particularly for LLMs that lack test-time compute, and (3) LLMs struggle to adhere to annotation guidelines and match exact schemas, which hinders their ability to understand detailed annotation requirements which is essential in biomedical annotation workflow. We experimented with prompt engineering techniques targeted to the above issues, and developed a pipeline that dynamically extracts instructions from annotation guidelines. Our results show that frontier LLMs can approach or surpass the performance of SOTA BERT-based models with minimal reliance on manually annotated data and without fine-tuning. Furthermore, we performed model distillation on a closed-source LLM, demonstrating that a BERT model trained exclusively on synthetic data annotated by LLMs can also achieve a practical performance. Based on these findings, we explored the feasibility of partially replacing manual annotation with LLMs in production scenarios for biomedical text mining.</description>

      <title>SCoRE: Benchmarking Long-Chain Reasoning in Commonsense Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, long-chain reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) because natural texts lack sufficient explicit reasoning data. However, existing benchmarks suffer from limitations such as narrow coverage, short reasoning paths, or high construction costs. We introduce SCoRE (Scenario-based Commonsense Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark that synthesizes multi-hop questions from scenario schemas of entities, relations, and logical rules to assess long-chain commonsense reasoning. SCoRE contains 100k bilingual (Chinese-English) multiple-choice questions whose reasoning chains span 2-11 hops and are grouped into various difficulty levels. Each question is accompanied by fine-grained knowledge labels, explicit reasoning chains, and difficulty levels for diagnostic evaluation. Evaluation results on cutting-edge LLMs such as o3-mini and Deepseek R1 shows that even the best model attains only 69.78% accuracy on SCoRE (even only 47.91% on the hard set), with errors often stemming from rare knowledge, logical inconsistency, and over-interpretation of simple questions. SCoRE offers a scalable, extensible framework for evaluating and diagnosing the long-chain commonsense reasoning abilities of LLMs and guiding future advances in model design and training.</description>

      <title>PolyPythias: Stability and Outliers across Fifty Language Model Pre-Training Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of language model pre-training and its effects on downstream performance are still understudied. Prior work shows that the training process can yield significantly different results in response to slight variations in initial conditions, e.g., the random seed. Crucially, the research community still lacks sufficient resources and tools to systematically investigate pre-training stability, particularly for decoder-only language models. We introduce the PolyPythias, a set of 45 new training runs for the Pythia model suite: 9 new seeds across 5 model sizes, from 14M to 410M parameters, resulting in about 7k new checkpoints that we release. Using these new 45 training runs, in addition to the 5 already available, we study the effects of different initial conditions determined by the seed -- i.e., parameters' initialisation and data order -- on (i) downstream performance, (ii) learned linguistic representations, and (iii) emergence of training phases. In addition to common scaling behaviours, our analyses generally reveal highly consistent training dynamics across both model sizes and initial conditions. Further, the new seeds for each model allow us to identify outlier training runs and delineate their characteristics. Our findings show the potential of using these methods to predict training stability.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Reasoning with LLMs for k-anonymity Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.</description>

      <title>UC-MOA: Utility-Conditioned Multi-Objective Alignment for Distributional Pareto-Optimality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, existing approaches struggle to capture the multi-dimensional, distributional nuances of human preferences. Methods such as RiC that directly inject raw reward values into prompts face significant numerical sensitivity issues--for instance, LLMs may fail to distinguish between 9.11 and 9.8--while alternatives like MORLHF, Rewarded Soups, and MODPO incur high computational costs by training multiple models. In this work, we introduce Utility-Conditioned Multi-Objective Alignment (UC-MOA), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations. Our approach leverages a diverse set of strictly increasing, non-linear utility functions to transform user-specified preferences into symbolic tokens, which are then used to condition a single LLM. This design not only mitigates numerical reasoning challenges but also substantially reduces training overhead, yielding models that achieve superior Pareto fronts and robust alignment across complex reward dimensions.</description>

      <title>HICD: Hallucination-Inducing via Attention Dispersion for Contrastive Decoding to Mitigate Hallucinations in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations, producing outputs that are contextually inaccurate or factually incorrect. We introduce HICD, a novel method designed to induce hallucinations for contrastive decoding to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing contrastive decoding methods, HICD selects attention heads crucial to the model's prediction as inducing heads, then induces hallucinations by dispersing attention of these inducing heads and compares the hallucinated outputs with the original outputs to obtain the final result. Our approach significantly improves performance on tasks requiring contextual faithfulness, such as context completion, reading comprehension, and question answering. It also improves factuality in tasks requiring accurate knowledge recall. We demonstrate that our inducing heads selection and attention dispersion method leads to more "contrast-effective" hallucinations for contrastive decoding, outperforming other hallucination-inducing methods. Our findings provide a promising strategy for reducing hallucinations by inducing hallucinations in a controlled manner, enhancing the performance of LLMs in a wide range of tasks.</description>

      <title>Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{CROSS}, a flexible framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. CROSS is designed by decomposing the TTAG modeling process into two phases: (i) temporal semantics extraction; and (ii) semantic-structural information unification. The key idea is to advance the large language models (LLMs) to dynamically extract the temporal semantics in text space and then generate cohesive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the CROSS framework, which empowers LLMs to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that CROSS achieves state-of-the-art results on four public datasets and one industrial dataset, with 24.7% absolute MRR gain on average in temporal link prediction and 3.7% AUC gain in node classification of industrial application.</description>

      <title>Challenging the Boundaries of Reasoning: An Olympiad-Level Math Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of large reasoning models has resulted in the saturation of existing benchmarks for evaluating mathematical reasoning, highlighting the urgent need for more challenging and rigorous evaluation frameworks. To address this gap, we introduce OlymMATH, a novel Olympiad-level mathematical benchmark, designed to rigorously test the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs. OlymMATH features 200 meticulously curated problems, each manually verified and available in parallel English and Chinese versions. The problems are systematically organized into two distinct difficulty tiers: (1) AIME-level problems (easy) that establish a baseline for mathematical reasoning assessment, and (2) significantly more challenging problems (hard) designed to push the boundaries of current state-of-the-art models. In our benchmark, these problems span four core mathematical fields, each including a verifiable numerical solution to enable objective, rule-based evaluation. Empirical results underscore the significant challenge presented by OlymMATH, with state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o3-mini and Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp demonstrating notably limited accuracy on the hard subset. Furthermore, the benchmark facilitates comprehensive bilingual assessment of mathematical reasoning abilities-a critical dimension that remains largely unaddressed in mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks. We release the benchmark, evaluation code, detailed results and a data visualization tool at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/OlymMATH.</description>

      <title>ReaRAG: Knowledge-guided Reasoning Enhances Factuality of Large Reasoning Models with Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities but rely primarily on parametric knowledge, limiting factual accuracy. While recent works equip reinforcement learning (RL)-based LRMs with retrieval capabilities, they suffer from overthinking and lack robustness in reasoning, reducing their effectiveness in question answering (QA) tasks. To address this, we propose ReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that explores diverse queries without excessive iterations. Our solution includes a novel data construction framework with an upper bound on the reasoning chain length. Specifically, we first leverage an LRM to generate deliberate thinking, then select an action from a predefined action space (Search and Finish). For Search action, a query is executed against the RAG engine, where the result is returned as observation to guide reasoning steps later. This process iterates until a Finish action is chosen. Benefiting from ReaRAG's strong reasoning capabilities, our approach outperforms existing baselines on multi-hop QA. Further analysis highlights its strong reflective ability to recognize errors and refine its reasoning trajectory. Our study enhances LRMs' factuality while effectively integrating robust reasoning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).</description>

      <title>ImF: Implicit Fingerprint for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and expensive, making protecting intellectual property (IP) for LLMs crucial. Recently, embedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for establishing model ownership. However, existing fingerprinting techniques typically embed identifiable patterns with weak semantic coherence, resulting in fingerprints that significantly differ from the natural question-answering (QA) behavior inherent to LLMs. This discrepancy undermines the stealthiness of the embedded fingerprints and makes them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first demonstrate the critical vulnerability of existing fingerprint embedding methods by introducing a novel adversarial attack named Generation Revision Intervention (GRI) attack. GRI attack exploits the semantic fragility of current fingerprinting methods, effectively erasing fingerprints by disrupting their weakly correlated semantic structures. Our empirical evaluation highlights that traditional fingerprinting approaches are significantly compromised by the GRI attack, revealing severe limitations in their robustness under realistic adversarial conditions. To advance the state-of-the-art in model fingerprinting, we propose a novel model fingerprint paradigm called Implicit Fingerprints (ImF). ImF leverages steganography techniques to subtly embed ownership information within natural texts, subsequently using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to construct semantically coherent and contextually natural QA pairs. This design ensures that fingerprints seamlessly integrate with the standard model behavior, remaining indistinguishable from regular outputs and substantially reducing the risk of accidental triggering and targeted removal. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ImF on 15 diverse LLMs, spanning different architectures and varying scales.</description>

      <title>Why Stop at One Error? Benchmarking LLMs as Data Science Code Debuggers for Multi-Hop and Multi-Bug Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs are transforming software development, yet current code generation and code repair benchmarks mainly assess syntactic and functional correctness in simple, single-error cases. LLMs' capabilities to autonomously find and fix runtime logical errors in complex data science code remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce DSDBench: the Data Science Debugging Benchmark, the first benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs on multi-hop error tracing and multi-bug detection in data science code debugging. DSDBench adapts datasets from existing data science task benchmarks, such as DABench and MatPlotBench, featuring realistic data science debugging tasks with automatically synthesized multi-hop, multi-bug code snippets. DSDBench includes 1,117 annotated samples with 741 cause-effect error pairs and runtime error messages. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on DSDBench show significant performance gaps, highlighting challenges in debugging logical runtime errors in data science code. DSDBench offers a crucial resource to evaluate and improve LLMs' debugging and reasoning capabilities, enabling more reliable AI-assisted data science in the future. DSDBench is publicly available at github.com/KevinCL16/DSDBench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain-specific intelligence demands specialized knowledge and sophisticated reasoning for problem-solving, posing significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) that struggle with knowledge hallucination and inadequate reasoning capabilities under constrained parameter budgets. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy in educational theory, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Modeling (RARE), a novel paradigm that decouples knowledge storage from reasoning optimization. RARE externalizes domain knowledge to retrievable sources and internalizes domain-specific reasoning patterns during training. Specifically, by injecting retrieved knowledge into training prompts with masked losses, RARE transforms learning objectives from rote memorization to contextualized reasoning. It enables models to bypass parameter-intensive memorization and prioritize the development of higher-order cognitive processes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that lightweight RARE-trained models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) could achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing retrieval-augmented GPT-4 and DeepSeek-R1 up to approximately 20\% accuracy. RARE establishes a paradigm shift where maintainable external knowledge bases synergize with compact, reasoning-optimized models, collectively driving more scalable domain-specific intelligence.</description>

      <title>FISH-Tuning: Enhancing PEFT Methods with Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth in the parameter size of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred the development of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods to mitigate the substantial computational costs of fine-tuning. Among these, Fisher Induced Sparse uncHanging (FISH) Mask is a selection-based PEFT technique that identifies a critical subset of pre-trained parameters using approximate Fisher information. While addition-based and reparameterization-based PEFT methods like LoRA and Adapter already fine-tune only a small number of parameters, the newly introduced parameters within these methods themselves present an opportunity for further optimization. Selectively fine-tuning only the most impactful among these new parameters could further reduce resource consumption while maintaining, or even improving, fine-tuning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FISH-Tuning}, a novel approach that incorporates FISH Mask into such PEFT methods, including LoRA, Adapter, and their variants. By leveraging Fisher information to identify and update only the most significant parameters within these added or reparameterized components, FISH-Tuning aims to achieve superior performance without increasing training time or inference latency compared to the vanilla PEFT methods. Experimental results across various datasets and pre-trained models demonstrate that FISH-Tuning consistently outperforms the vanilla PEFT methods when using the same proportion of trainable parameters.

      <title>Leveraging Robust Optimization for LLM Alignment under Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preference alignment methods are increasingly critical for steering large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs consistent with human values. While recent approaches often rely on synthetic data generated by LLMs for scalability and cost-efficiency reasons, this reliance can introduce distribution shifts that undermine the nuanced representation of human preferences needed for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment despite such shifts. Our approach first leverages well-learned classifiers to assign a calibration value to each training sample, quantifying its alignment with the target human-preferred distribution. These values are then incorporated into a robust optimization objective that minimizes the worst-case loss over regions of the data space most relevant to human preferences. By explicitly focusing optimization on the target distribution, our approach mitigates the impact of distributional mismatch and improves the generation of responses that better reflect intended values.</description>

      <title>LSR-MCTS: Alleviating Long Range Dependency in Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly promoted the development of code generation task, sparking a surge in pertinent literature. Current research is hindered by redundant generation results and a tendency to overfit local patterns in the short term. Although existing studies attempt to alleviate the issue by adopting a multi-token prediction strategy, there remains limited focus on choosing the appropriate processing length for generations. By analyzing the attention between tokens during the generation process of LLMs, it can be observed that the high spikes of the attention scores typically appear at the end of lines. This insight suggests that it is reasonable to treat each line of code as a fundamental processing unit and generate them sequentially. Inspired by this, we propose the \textbf{LSR-MCTS} algorithm, which leverages MCTS to determine the code line-by-line and select the optimal path. Further, we integrate a self-refine mechanism at each node to enhance diversity and generate higher-quality programs through error correction. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses on three public coding benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance approaches.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Could Be Rote Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks are widely used for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their reliability is undermined by benchmark contamination. In this study, we reframe contamination as an inherent aspect of learning and seek to disentangle genuine capability acquisition from superficial memorization in LLM evaluation. First, by analyzing model performance under different memorization conditions, we uncover a counterintuitive trend: LLMs perform worse on memorized MCQs than on non-memorized ones, indicating the coexistence of two distinct learning phenomena, i.e., rote memorization and genuine capability learning. To disentangle them, we propose TrinEval, a novel evaluation framework reformulating MCQs into an alternative trinity format, reducing memorization while preserving knowledge assessment. Experiments validate TrinEval's effectiveness in reformulation, and its evaluation reveals that common LLMs may memorize by rote 20.5% of knowledge points (in MMLU on average).</description>

Abstract: Dynamic Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has shown great success in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during generation. However, existing dynamic RAG methods face significant limitations in two key aspects: 1) Lack of an effective mechanism to control retrieval triggers, and 2) Lack of effective scrutiny of retrieval content. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative dynamic RAG method, DioR (Adaptive Cognitive Detection and Contextual Retrieval Optimization), which consists of two main components: adaptive cognitive detection and contextual retrieval optimization, specifically designed to determine when retrieval is needed and what to retrieve for LLMs is useful. Experimental results demonstrate that DioR achieves superior performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our work.</description>

      <title>Semantic Similarity-Informed Bayesian Borrowing for Quantitative Signal Detection of Adverse Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian dynamic borrowing (BDB) approach to enhance the quantitative identification of adverse events (AEs) in spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs). The method embeds a robust meta-analytic predictive (MAP) prior with a Bayesian hierarchical model and incorporates semantic similarity measures (SSMs) to enable weighted information sharing from clinically similar MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) to the target PT. This continuous similarity-based borrowing overcomes limitations of rigid hierarchical grouping in current disproportionality analysis (DPA).
  Using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 2015 and 2019, we evaluate our approach -- termed IC SSM -- against traditional Information Component (IC) analysis and IC with borrowing at the MedDRA high-level group term level (IC HLGT). A reference set (PVLens), derived from FDA product label update, enabled prospective evaluation of method performance in identifying AEs prior to official labeling.
  The IC SSM approach demonstrated higher sensitivity (1332/2337=0.570, Youden's J=0.246) than traditional IC (Se=0.501, J=0.250) and IC HLGT (Se=0.556, J=0.225), consistently identifying more true positives and doing so on average 5 months sooner than traditional IC. Despite a marginally lower aggregate F1-score and Youden's index, IC SSM showed higher performance in early post-marketing periods or when the detection threshold was raised, providing more stable and relevant alerts than IC HLGT and traditional IC.
  These findings support the use of SSM-informed Bayesian borrowing as a scalable and context-aware enhancement to traditional DPA methods, with potential for validation across other datasets and exploration of additional similarity metrics and Bayesian strategies using case-level data.</description>

      <title>CoT-RAG: Integrating Chain of Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Enhance Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning boosts large language models' (LLMs) performance on complex tasks but faces two key limitations: a lack of reliability when solely relying on LLM-generated reasoning chains and interference from natural language reasoning steps with the models' inference process, also known as the inference logic of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose CoT-RAG, a novel reasoning framework with three key designs: (i) Knowledge Graph-driven CoT Generation,featuring knowledge graphs to modulate reasoning chain generation of LLMs, thereby enhancing reasoning credibility; (ii) Learnable Knowledge Case-aware RAG, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into knowledge graphs to retrieve relevant sub-cases and sub-descriptions, providing LLMs with learnable information; (iii) Pseudo-Program Prompting Execution, which promotes greater logical rigor by guiding LLMs to execute reasoning tasks as pseudo-programs. Evaluations on nine public datasets spanning three reasoning tasks reveal significant accuracy gains--ranging from 4.0% to 44.3%--over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, tests on four domain-specific datasets demonstrate exceptional accuracy and efficient execution, underscoring its practical applicability and scalability.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Coreference Resolution for Chinese Social Media Dialogues: Dataset and Benchmark Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal coreference resolution (MCR) aims to identify mentions referring to the same entity across different modalities, such as text and visuals, and is essential for understanding multimodal content. In the era of rapidly growing mutimodal content and social media, MCR is particularly crucial for interpreting user interactions and bridging text-visual references to improve communication and personalization. However, MCR research for real-world dialogues remains unexplored due to the lack of sufficient data resources. To address this gap, we introduce TikTalkCoref, the first Chinese multimodal coreference dataset for social media in real-world scenarios, derived from the popular Douyin short-video platform. This dataset pairs short videos with corresponding textual dialogues from user comments and includes manually annotated coreference clusters for both person mentions in the text and the coreferential person head regions in the corresponding video frames. We also present an effective benchmark approach for MCR, focusing on the celebrity domain, and conduct extensive experiments on our dataset, providing reliable benchmark results for this newly constructed dataset. We will release the TikTalkCoref dataset to facilitate future research on MCR for real-world social media dialogues.</description>

      <title>Trans-Zero: Self-Play Incentivizes Large Language Models for Multilingual Translation Without Parallel Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has reshaped machine translation (MT), but multilingual MT still relies heavily on parallel data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), facing challenges like data scarcity for low-resource languages and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose TRANS-ZERO, a self-play framework that leverages only monolingual data and the intrinsic multilingual knowledge of LLM. TRANS-ZERO combines Genetic Monte-Carlo Tree Search (G-MCTS) with preference optimization, achieving strong translation performance that rivals supervised methods. Experiments demonstrate that this approach not only matches the performance of models trained on large-scale parallel data but also excels in non-English translation directions. Further analysis reveals that G-MCTS itself significantly enhances translation quality by exploring semantically consistent candidates through iterative translations, providing a robust foundation for the framework's succuss.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Early Exit in Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning language models (LRLMs) rely on test-time scaling, which extends long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation to solve complex tasks. However, overthinking in long CoT not only slows down the efficiency of problem solving, but also risks accuracy loss due to the extremely detailed or redundant reasoning steps. We propose a simple yet effective method that allows LLMs to self-truncate CoT sequences by early exit during generation. Instead of relying on fixed heuristics, the proposed method monitors model behavior at potential reasoning transition points (e.g.,"Wait" tokens) and dynamically terminates the next reasoning chain's generation when the model exhibits high confidence in a trial answer. Our method requires no additional training and can be seamlessly integrated into existing o1-like reasoning LLMs. Experiments on 10 reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, MATH-500, AMC, GPQA, AIME and LiveCodeBench) show that the proposed method is consistently effective on 11 cutting-edge reasoning LLMs of varying series and sizes, reducing the length of CoT sequences by an average of 19.1% to 80.1% while improving accuracy by 0.3% to 5.0%.</description>

      <title>PHYBench: Holistic Evaluation of Physical Perception and Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant limitations: task oversimplification, data contamination, and flawed evaluation items. These deficiencies necessitate more rigorous assessment methods. To address these limitations, we introduce PHYBench, a benchmark of 500 original physics problems ranging from high school to Physics Olympiad difficulty. PHYBench addresses data contamination through original content and employs a systematic curation pipeline to eliminate flawed items. Evaluations show that PHYBench activates more tokens and provides stronger differentiation between reasoning models compared to other baselines like AIME 2024, OlympiadBench and GPQA. Even the best-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieves only 36.9% accuracy compared to human experts' 61.9%. To further enhance evaluation precision, we introduce the Expression Edit Distance (EED) Score for mathematical expression assessment, which improves sample efficiency by 204% over binary scoring. Moreover, PHYBench effectively elicits multi-step and multi-condition reasoning, providing a platform for examining models' reasoning robustness, preferences, and deficiencies. The benchmark results and dataset are publicly available at https://www.phybench.cn/.</description>

      <title>OptimAI: Optimization from Natural Language Using LLM-Powered AI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization plays a vital role in scientific research and practical applications. However, formulating a concrete optimization problem described in natural language into a mathematical form and selecting a suitable solver to solve the problem requires substantial domain expertise. We introduce OptimAI, a framework for solving Optimization problems described in natural language by leveraging LLM-powered AI agents, and achieve superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is built upon the following key roles: (1) a formulator that translates natural language problem descriptions into precise mathematical formulations; (2) a planner that constructs a high-level solution strategy prior to execution; and (3) a coder and a code critic capable of interacting with the environment and reflecting on outcomes to refine future actions. Ablation studies confirm that all roles are essential; removing the planner or code critic results in $5.8\times$ and $3.1\times$ drops in productivity, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce UCB-based debug scheduling to dynamically switch between alternative plans, yielding an additional $3.3\times$ productivity gain. Our design emphasizes multi-agent collaboration, and our experiments confirm that combining diverse models leads to performance gains. Our approach attains 88.1% accuracy on the NLP4LP dataset and 82.3% on the Optibench dataset, reducing error rates by 58% and 52%, respectively, over prior best results.</description>

      <title>Paper2Code: Automating Code Generation from Scientific Papers in Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, particularly from the authors of those papers, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins. Code is available at: https://github.com/going-doer/Paper2Code.</description>

      <title>SPC: Evolving Self-Play Critic via Adversarial Games for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM) reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a "sneaky generator" that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a "critic" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, SPC can guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs and significantly improve their mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, surpassing those guided by state-of-the-art process reward models.</description>

      <title>VCM: Vision Concept Modeling Based on Implicit Contrastive Learning with Vision-Language Instruction Fine-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are pivotal for real-world AI tasks like embodied intelligence due to their strong vision-language reasoning abilities. However, current LVLMs process entire images at the token level, which is inefficient compared to humans who analyze information and generate content at the conceptual level, extracting relevant visual concepts with minimal effort. This inefficiency, stemming from the lack of a visual concept model, limits LVLMs' usability in real-world applications. To address this, we propose VCM, an end-to-end self-supervised visual concept modeling framework. VCM leverages implicit contrastive learning across multiple sampled instances and vision-language fine-tuning to construct a visual concept model without requiring costly concept-level annotations. Our results show that VCM significantly reduces computational costs (e.g., 85\% fewer FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-7B) while maintaining strong performance across diverse image understanding tasks. Moreover, VCM enhances visual encoders' capabilities in classic visual concept perception tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of VCM.</description>

      <title>Toward Evaluative Thinking: Meta Policy Optimization with Evolving Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reward-based alignment methods for large language models (LLMs) face two key limitations: vulnerability to reward hacking, where models exploit flaws in the reward signal; and reliance on brittle, labor-intensive prompt engineering when LLMs are used as reward models. We introduce Meta Policy Optimization (MPO), a framework that addresses these challenges by integrating a meta-reward model that dynamically refines the reward model's prompt throughout training. In MPO, the meta-reward model monitors the evolving training context and continuously adjusts the reward model's prompt to maintain high alignment, providing an adaptive reward signal that resists exploitation by the policy. This meta-learning approach promotes a more stable policy optimization, and greatly reduces the need for manual reward prompt design. It yields performance on par with or better than models guided by extensively hand-crafted reward prompts. Furthermore, we show that MPO maintains its effectiveness across diverse tasks, from essay writing to mathematical reasoning, without requiring specialized reward designs. Beyond standard RLAIF, MPO's meta-learning formulation is readily extensible to higher-level alignment frameworks. Overall, this method addresses theoretical and practical challenges in reward-based RL alignment for LLMs, paving the way for more robust and adaptable alignment strategies.

      <title>UniversalRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Corpora of Diverse Modalities and Granularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown substantial promise in improving factual accuracy by grounding model responses with external knowledge relevant to queries. However, most existing RAG approaches are limited to a text-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other modalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single modality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the type of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot address. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with diverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the observation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space derived from a single aggregated corpus causes a modality gap, where the retrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose a modality-aware routing mechanism that dynamically identifies the most appropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it. Also, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity levels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of the query. We validate UniversalRAG on 8 benchmarks spanning multiple modalities, showing its superiority over various modality-specific and unified baselines.</description>

      <title>Computational Reasoning of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development and widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), multidimensional evaluation has become increasingly critical. However, current evaluations are often domain-specific and overly complex, limiting their effectiveness as cross-domain proxies for core capabilities. To address these limitations and enable a unified and simple evaluation framework, an ideal proxy task should target a basic capability that generalizes across tasks and is independent of domain-specific knowledge. Turing machine provides a powerful theoretical lens by reducing complex processes to basic, domain-agnostic computational operations. This perspective offers a principled framework for evaluating basic computational abilities essential to a wide range of tasks. Motivated by this abstraction, we introduce \textbf{Turing Machine Bench}, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to \textbf{strictly follow rules} and \textbf{accurately manage internal states} for multi-step, referred to as \textbf{computational reasoning}. TMBench incorporates four key features: self-contained and knowledge-agnostic reasoning, a minimalistic multi-step structure, controllable difficulty, and a solid theoretical foundation based on Turing machine. Empirical results demonstrate that TMBench serves as an effective proxy for evaluating computational reasoning on representative LLMs. It produces clear step-wise accuracy curves, revealing LLMs' ability to execute multi-step reasoning processes. By analyzing performance trends across TMBench and established reasoning benchmarks, we find strong correlations with real-world tasks, bridging real-task evaluation with basic ability assessment. These findings suggest that TMBench holds potential as a cross-domain dimension for evaluating reasoning in LLMs. Code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/HaitaoWuTJU/Turing-Machine-Bench}{Repo}.</description>

      <title>FreqKV: Frequency Domain Key-Value Compression for Efficient Context Window Extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-domain compression has proven effective in reducing redundancies for spatial signals. In this work, we propose FreqKV, a novel frequency domain key-value (KV) compression technique that enables efficient context window extension for decoder-only large language models (LLMs). Our approach is motivated by a key observation that, in the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency components. By discarding high-frequency components, we achieve efficient compression of the KV cache with minimal information loss. FreqKV iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in the frequency domain, allowing models to process lengthy contexts efficiently. Introducing no additional parameters or architectural modifications, FreqKV is applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. With minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window. Experiments on a range of long context language modeling and understanding tasks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Synthesize-on-Graph: Knowledgeable Synthetic Data Generation for Continue Pre-training of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but remain data-inefficient, especially when learning from small, specialized corpora with limited and proprietary data. Existing synthetic data generation methods for continue pre-training focus on intra-document content and overlook cross-document knowledge associations, limiting content diversity and depth. We propose Synthetic-on-Graph (SoG), a synthetic data generation framework that incorporates cross-document knowledge associations for efficient corpus expansion. SoG constructs a context graph by extracting entities and concepts from the original corpus, representing cross-document associations, and employing a graph walk strategy for knowledge-associated sampling. This enhances synthetic data diversity and coherence, enabling models to learn complex knowledge structures and handle rare knowledge. To further improve synthetic data quality, we integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Contrastive Clarifying (CC) synthetic, enhancing reasoning processes and discriminative power. Experiments show that SoG outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method in a multi-hop document Q&amp;A dataset while performing comparably to the SOTA method on the reading comprehension task datasets, which also underscores the better generalization capability of SoG. Our work advances synthetic data generation and provides practical solutions for efficient knowledge acquisition in LLMs, especially in domains with limited data availability.</description>

      <title>RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback. To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RMs interpretability and performance. To this end, we introduce a new class of generative reward models - Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) - which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. RM-R1 features a chain-of-rubrics (CoR) mechanism - self-generating sample-level chat rubrics or math/code solutions, and evaluating candidate responses against them. The training of RM-R1 consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across three reward model benchmarks on average, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 4.9%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analyses to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six REASRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.</description>

      <title>Reward-SQL: Boosting Text-to-SQL via Stepwise Reasoning and Process-Supervised Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task by leveraging their powerful reasoning capabilities. To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation. To address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process effectively. Our approach follows a "cold start, then PRM supervision" paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions (Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline. Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that combining PRM as an online training signal (e.g.,GRPO) with PRM-guided inference (e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by PRM (7B) to achieve a 13.1% performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL in leveraging reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning.</description>

      <title>RICo: Refined In-Context Contribution for Automatic Instruction-Tuning Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data selection for instruction tuning is crucial for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) while reducing training costs. In this paper, we propose Refined Contribution Measurement with In-Context Learning (RICo), a novel gradient-free method that quantifies the fine-grained contribution of individual samples to both task-level and global-level model performance. RICo enables more accurate identification of high-contribution data, leading to better instruction tuning. We further introduce a lightweight selection paradigm trained on RICo scores, enabling scalable data selection with a strictly linear inference complexity. Extensive experiments on three LLMs across 12 benchmarks and 5 pairwise evaluation sets demonstrate the effectiveness of RICo. Remarkably, on LLaMA3.1-8B, models trained on 15% of RICo-selected data outperform full datasets by 5.42% points and exceed the best performance of widely used selection methods by 2.06% points. We further analyze high-contribution samples selected by RICo, which show both diverse tasks and appropriate difficulty levels, rather than just the hardest ones.</description>

      <title>Concept-Level Explainability for Auditing &amp; Steering LLM Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their safety and alignment grow. An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately, rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g., gender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness of LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human alignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming attribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment, demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in guiding LLM behavior.</description>

      <title>TSLFormer: A Lightweight Transformer Model for Turkish Sign Language Recognition Using Skeletal Landmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents TSLFormer, a light and robust word-level Turkish Sign Language (TSL) recognition model that treats sign gestures as ordered, string-like language. Instead of using raw RGB or depth videos, our method only works with 3D joint positions - articulation points - extracted using Google's Mediapipe library, which focuses on the hand and torso skeletal locations. This creates efficient input dimensionality reduction while preserving important semantic gesture information.
  Our approach revisits sign language recognition as sequence-to-sequence translation, inspired by the linguistic nature of sign languages and the success of transformers in natural language processing. Since TSLFormer uses the self-attention mechanism, it effectively captures temporal co-occurrence within gesture sequences and highlights meaningful motion patterns as words unfold.
  Evaluated on the AUTSL dataset with over 36,000 samples and 227 different words, TSLFormer achieves competitive performance with minimal computational cost. These results show that joint-based input is sufficient for enabling real-time, mobile, and assistive communication systems for hearing-impaired individuals.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: When Goal-Gradient Importance Meets Dynamic Skipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for complex tasks, but their reasoning traces are often excessively verbose and inefficient, leading to significant computational costs and latency. Current CoT compression techniques typically rely on generic importance metrics and static compression rates, which may inadvertently remove functionally critical tokens or fail to adapt to varying reasoning complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptive GoGI-Skip, a novel framework learning dynamic CoT compression via supervised fine-tuning. This approach introduces two synergistic innovations: (1) Goal-Gradient Importance (GoGI), a novel metric accurately identifying functionally relevant tokens by measuring the gradient influence of their intermediate representations on the final answer loss, and (2) Adaptive Dynamic Skipping (ADS), a mechanism dynamically regulating the compression rate based on runtime model uncertainty while ensuring local coherence through an adaptive N-token constraint. To our knowledge, this is the first work unifying a goal-oriented, gradient-based importance metric with dynamic, uncertainty-aware skipping for CoT compression. Trained on compressed MATH data, Adaptive GoGI-Skip demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization across diverse reasoning benchmarks including AIME, GPQA, and GSM8K. It achieves substantial efficiency gains - reducing CoT token counts by over 45% on average and delivering 1.6-2.0 times inference speedups - while maintaining high reasoning accuracy. Notably, it significantly outperforms existing baselines by preserving accuracy even at high effective compression rates, advancing the state of the art in the CoT reasoning efficiency-accuracy trade-off.</description>

      <title>WorldPM: Scaling Human Preference Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by scaling laws in language modeling that demonstrate how test loss scales as a power law with model and dataset sizes, we find that similar laws exist in preference modeling. We propose World Preference Modeling$ (WorldPM) to emphasize this scaling potential, where World Preference embodies a unified representation of human preferences. In this paper, we collect preference data from public forums covering diverse user communities, and conduct extensive training using 15M-scale data across models ranging from 1.5B to 72B parameters. We observe distinct patterns across different evaluation metrics: (1) Adversarial metrics (ability to identify deceptive features) consistently scale up with increased training data and base model size; (2) Objective metrics (objective knowledge with well-defined answers) show emergent behavior in larger language models, highlighting WorldPM's scalability potential; (3) Subjective metrics (subjective preferences from a limited number of humans or AI) do not demonstrate scaling trends. Further experiments validate the effectiveness of WorldPM as a foundation for preference fine-tuning. Through evaluations on 7 benchmarks with 20 subtasks, we find that WorldPM broadly improves the generalization performance across human preference datasets of varying sizes (7K, 100K and 800K samples), with performance gains exceeding 5% on many key subtasks. Integrating WorldPM into our internal RLHF pipeline, we observe significant improvements on both in-house and public evaluation sets, with notable gains of 4% to 8% in our in-house evaluations.</description>

      <title>Tracr-Injection: Distilling Algorithms into Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the surge of large language models, there has been a push to formally characterize the symbolic abilities intrinsic to the transformer architecture. A programming language, called RASP, has been proposed, which can be directly compiled into transformer weights to implement these algorithms. However, the tasks that can be implemented in RASP are often uncommon to learn from natural unsupervised data, showing a mismatch between theoretical capabilities of the transformer architecture, and the practical learnability of these capabilities from unsupervised data. We propose tracr-injection, a method that allows us to distill algorithms written in RASP directly into a pre-trained language model. We showcase our method by injecting 3 different algorithms into a language model. We show how our method creates an interpretable subspace within the model's residual stream, which can be decoded into the variables present in the code of the RASP algorithm. Additionally, we found that the proposed method can improve out-of-distribution performance compared to our baseline, indicating that indeed a more symbolic mechanism is taking place in the inner workings of the model. We release the code used to run our experiments.</description>

      <title>Finetune-RAG: Fine-Tuning Language Models to Resist Hallucination in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to improve factuality in large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in retrieved documents. However, ensuring perfect retrieval of relevant information remains challenging, and when irrelevant content is passed downstream to an LLM, it can lead to hallucinations. In this work, we propose Finetune-RAG, a simple and effective fine-tuning approach that features the first-of-its-kind RAG training dataset constructed to mimic real-world imperfections. Experimental results show that Finetune-RAG improves factual accuracy by 21.2% over the base model. We also propose Bench-RAG, an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation pipeline that stress tests models under realistic imperfect retrieval scenarios. Our codebase and dataset are fully open sourced for community use.</description>

      <title>OntoURL: A Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Symbolic Ontological Understanding, Reasoning and Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to process structured symbolic knowledge remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of LLMs' ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' proficiency in handling ontologies -- formal, symbolic representations of domain knowledge through concepts, relationships, and instances. Based on the proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions: understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 58,981 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with 20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models, tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing proficiency in understanding ontological knowledge but substantial weaknesses in reasoning and learning tasks. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in LLMs' capability to process symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating personalized and actionable exercise plans often requires iteration with experts, which can be costly and inaccessible to many individuals. This work explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in addressing these challenges. We present PlanFitting, an LLM-driven conversational agent that assists users in creating and refining personalized weekly exercise plans. By engaging users in free-form conversations, PlanFitting helps elicit users' goals, availabilities, and potential obstacles, and enables individuals to generate personalized exercise plans aligned with established exercise guidelines. Our study -- involving a user study, intrinsic evaluation, and expert evaluation -- demonstrated PlanFitting's ability to guide users to create tailored, actionable, and evidence-based plans. We discuss future design opportunities for LLM-driven conversational agents to create plans that better comply with exercise principles and accommodate personal constraints.</description>

      <title>BAT: Learning to Reason about Spatial Sounds with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial sound reasoning is a fundamental human skill, enabling us to navigate and interpret our surroundings based on sound. In this paper we present BAT, which combines the spatial sound perception ability of a binaural acoustic scene analysis model with the natural language reasoning capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to replicate this innate ability. To address the lack of existing datasets of in-the-wild spatial sounds, we synthesized a binaural audio dataset using AudioSet and SoundSpaces 2.0. Next, we developed SpatialSoundQA, a spatial sound-based question-answering dataset, offering a range of QA tasks that train BAT in various aspects of spatial sound perception and reasoning. The acoustic front end encoder of BAT is a novel spatial audio encoder named Spatial Audio Spectrogram Transformer, or Spatial-AST, which by itself achieves strong performance across sound event detection, spatial localization, and distance estimation. By integrating Spatial-AST with LLaMA-2 7B model, BAT transcends standard Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) tasks, enabling the model to reason about the relationships between the sounds in its environment. Our experiments demonstrate BAT's superior performance on both spatial sound perception and reasoning, showcasing the immense potential of LLMs in navigating and interpreting complex spatial audio environments.</description>

      <title>Usable XAI: 10 Strategies Towards Exploiting Explainability in the LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) refers to techniques that provide human-understandable insights into the workings of AI models. Recently, the focus of XAI is being extended toward explaining Large Language Models (LLMs). This extension calls for a significant transformation in the XAI methodologies for two reasons. First, many existing XAI methods cannot be directly applied to LLMs due to their complexity and advanced capabilities. Second, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in diverse applications, the role of XAI shifts from merely opening the ``black box'' to actively enhancing the productivity and applicability of LLMs in real-world settings. Meanwhile, the conversation and generation abilities of LLMs can reciprocally enhance XAI. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Usable XAI in the context of LLMs by analyzing (1) how XAI can explain and improve LLM-based AI systems and (2) how XAI techniques can be improved by using LLMs. We introduce 10 strategies, introducing the key techniques for each and discussing their associated challenges. We also provide case studies to demonstrate how to obtain and leverage explanations. The code used in this paper can be found at: https://github.com/JacksonWuxs/UsableXAI_LLM.</description>

      <title>Controlled Training Data Generation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to control a text-to-image generative model to produce training data useful for supervised learning. Unlike previous works that employ an open-loop approach and pre-define prompts to generate new data using either a language model or human expertise, we develop an automated closed-loop system which involves two feedback mechanisms. The first mechanism uses feedback from a given supervised model and finds adversarial prompts that result in image generations that maximize the model loss. While these adversarial prompts result in diverse data informed by the model, they are not informed of the target distribution, which can be inefficient. Therefore, we introduce the second feedback mechanism that guides the generation process towards a certain target distribution. We call the method combining these two mechanisms Guided Adversarial Prompts. We perform our evaluations on different tasks, datasets and architectures, with different types of distribution shifts (spuriously correlated data, unseen domains) and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed feedback mechanisms compared to open-loop approaches.</description>

      <title>Efficient Indirect LLM Jailbreak via Multimodal-LLM Jailbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on jailbreaking attacks against large language models (LLMs), eliciting them to generate objectionable content in response to harmful user queries. Unlike previous LLM-jailbreak methods that directly orient to LLMs, our approach begins by constructing a multimodal large language model (MLLM) built upon the target LLM. Subsequently, we perform an efficient MLLM jailbreak and obtain a jailbreaking embedding. Finally, we convert the embedding into a textual jailbreaking suffix to carry out the jailbreak of target LLM. Compared to the direct LLM-jailbreak methods, our indirect jailbreaking approach is more efficient, as MLLMs are more vulnerable to jailbreak than pure LLM. Additionally, to improve the attack success rate of jailbreak, we propose an image-text semantic matching scheme to identify a suitable initial input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art jailbreak methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior cross-class generalization abilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topic models are useful tools for discovering latent semantic structures in large textual corpora. Recent efforts have been oriented at incorporating contextual representations in topic modeling and have been shown to outperform classical topic models. These approaches are typically slow, volatile, and require heavy preprocessing for optimal results. We present Semantic Signal Separation ($S^3$), a theory-driven topic modeling approach in neural embedding spaces. $S^3$ conceptualizes topics as independent axes of semantic space and uncovers these by decomposing contextualized document embeddings using Independent Component Analysis. Our approach provides diverse and highly coherent topics, requires no preprocessing, and is demonstrated to be the fastest contextual topic model, being, on average, 4.5x faster than the runner-up BERTopic. We offer an implementation of $S^3$, and all contextual baselines, in the Turftopic Python package.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10281</link>

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models enables the creation of realistic machine-generated content. Watermarking is a promising approach to distinguish machine-generated text from human text, embedding statistical signals in the output that are ideally undetectable to humans. We propose a watermarking framework that encodes such signals through an error correcting code. Our method, termed robust binary code (RBC) watermark, introduces no noticeable degradation in quality. We evaluate our watermark on base and instruction fine-tuned models and find our watermark is robust to edits, deletions, and translations. We provide an information-theoretic perspective on watermarking, a powerful statistical test for detection and for generating $p$-values, and theoretical guarantees. Our empirical findings suggest our watermark is fast, powerful, and robust, comparing favorably to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model. Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem and break down a prompt into loosely coupled semantic sections. The proposed algorithm, UniPrompt, (1) clusters the input space and uses clustered batches so that each batch likely corresponds to a different facet of the task, and (2) utilizes a feedback mechanism to propose adding, editing or deleting a section, which in turn is aggregated over a batch to capture generalizable facets. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using \shortname{} obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt is available at https://aka.ms/uniprompt.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent with generalized Newton's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the generalized Newton's method (GeN) -- a Hessian-informed approach that applies to any optimizer such as SGD and Adam, and covers the Newton-Raphson method as a sub-case. Our method automatically and dynamically selects the learning rate that accelerates the convergence, without the intensive tuning of the learning rate scheduler. In practice, our method is easily implementable, since it only requires additional forward passes with almost zero computational overhead (in terms of training time and memory cost), if the overhead is amortized over many iterations. We present extensive experiments on language and vision tasks (e.g. GPT and ResNet) to showcase that GeN optimizers match the state-of-the-art performance, which was achieved with carefully tuned learning rate schedulers.</description>

      <title>EfficientQAT: Efficient Quantization-Aware Training for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are crucial in modern natural language processing and artificial intelligence. However, they face challenges in managing their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware training (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit representations with minimal accuracy loss, it is impractical due to substantial training resources. To address this, we propose Efficient Quantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm. EfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all parameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters (E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable direct training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy loss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization. E2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end, further improving the performance of quantized models by considering interactions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of models, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with scales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance, EfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41 hours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full precision (69.48 vs. 72.41). Code is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/EfficientQAT.</description>

      <title>"Yes, My LoRD." Guiding Language Model Extraction with Locality Reinforced Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model extraction attacks (MEAs) on large language models (LLMs) have received increasing attention in recent research. However, existing attack methods typically adapt the extraction strategies originally developed for deep neural networks (DNNs). They neglect the underlying inconsistency between the training tasks of MEA and LLM alignment, leading to suboptimal attack performance. To tackle this issue, we propose Locality Reinforced Distillation (LoRD), a novel model extraction algorithm specifically designed for LLMs. In particular, LoRD employs a newly defined policy-gradient-style training task that utilizes the responses of victim model as the signal to guide the crafting of preference for the local model. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that I) The convergence procedure of LoRD in model extraction is consistent with the alignment procedure of LLMs, and II) LoRD can reduce query complexity while mitigating watermark protection through our exploration-based stealing. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method in extracting various state-of-the-art commercial LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/liangzid/LoRD-MEA .</description>

      <title>Immunogenicity Prediction with Dual Attention Enables Vaccine Target Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Immunogenicity prediction is a central topic in reverse vaccinology for finding candidate vaccines that can trigger protective immune responses. Existing approaches typically rely on highly compressed features and simple model architectures, leading to limited prediction accuracy and poor generalizability. To address these challenges, we introduce VenusVaccine, a novel deep learning solution with a dual attention mechanism that integrates pre-trained latent vector representations of protein sequences and structures. We also compile the most comprehensive immunogenicity dataset to date, encompassing over 7000 antigen sequences, structures, and immunogenicity labels from bacteria, virus, and tumor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VenusVaccine outperforms existing methods across a wide range of evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we establish a post-hoc validation protocol to assess the practical significance of deep learning models in tackling vaccine design challenges. Our work provides an effective tool for vaccine design and sets valuable benchmarks for future research. The implementation is at https://github.com/songleee/VenusVaccine.</description>

      <title>Inference and Verbalization Functions During In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LMs) are capable of in-context learning from a few demonstrations (example-label pairs) to solve new tasks during inference. Despite the intuitive importance of high-quality demonstrations, previous work has observed that, in some settings, ICL performance is minimally affected by irrelevant labels (Min et al., 2022). We hypothesize that LMs perform ICL with irrelevant labels via two sequential processes: an inference function that solves the task, followed by a verbalization function that maps the inferred answer to the label space. Importantly, we hypothesize that the inference function is invariant to remappings of the label space (e.g., "true"/"false" to "cat"/"dog"), enabling LMs to share the same inference function across settings with different label words. We empirically validate this hypothesis with controlled layer-wise interchange intervention experiments. Our findings confirm the hypotheses on multiple datasets and tasks (natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and topic classification) and further suggest that the two functions can be localized in specific layers across various open-sourced models, including GEMMA-7B, MISTRAL-7B-V0.3, GEMMA-2-27B, and LLAMA-3.1-70B.</description>

      <title>Bias Similarity Across Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bias in Large Language Models remains a critical concern as these systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications. Yet most fairness evaluations rely on scalar metrics or single-model analysis, overlooking how biases align -- or diverge -- across model families, scales, and tuning strategies. In this work, we reframe bias similarity as a form of functional similarity and evaluate 24 LLMs from four major families on over one million structured prompts spanning four bias dimensions. Our findings uncover that fairness is not strongly determined by model size, architecture, instruction tuning, or openness. Instead, bias behaviors are highly context-dependent and structurally persistent, often resistant to current alignment techniques. Contrary to common assumptions, we find that open-source models frequently match or outperform proprietary models in both fairness and utility. These results call into question the default reliance on proprietary systems and highlight the need for behaviorally grounded, model-specific audits to better understand how bias manifests and endures across the LLM landscape.</description>

      <title>BrainECHO: Semantic Brain Signal Decoding through Vector-Quantized Spectrogram Reconstruction for Whisper-Enhanced Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current EEG/MEG-to-text decoding systems suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on teacher-forcing methods, which compromises robustness during inference, (2) sensitivity to session-specific noise, hindering generalization across subjects, and (3) misalignment between brain signals and linguistic representations due to pre-trained language model over-dominance. To overcome these challenges, we propose BrainECHO (Brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn), a multi-stage framework that employs decoupled representation learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both EEG and MEG datasets. Specifically, BrainECHO consists of three stages: (1) Discrete autoencoding, which transforms continuous Mel spectrograms into a finite set of high-quality discrete representations for subsequent stages. (2) Frozen alignment, where brain signal embeddings are mapped to corresponding Mel spectrogram embeddings in a frozen latent space, effectively filtering session-specific noise through vector-quantized reconstruction, yielding a 3.65% improvement in BLEU-4 score. (3) Constrained decoding fine-tuning, which leverages the pre-trained Whisper model for audio-to-text translation, balancing signal adaptation with knowledge preservation, and achieving 74%-89% decoding BLEU scores without excessive reliance on teacher forcing. BrainECHO demonstrates robustness across sentence, session, and subject-independent conditions, passing Gaussian noise tests and showcasing its potential for enhancing language-based brain-computer interfaces.</description>

      <title>LLMScan: Causal Scan for LLM Misbehavior Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various fields, their potential to generate untruthful, biased and harmful responses poses significant risks, particularly in critical applications. This highlights the urgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior. While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses, this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based on causality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematically monitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference, operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently when misbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokens and transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in the causal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling the development of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehavior detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Decoding Time Series with LLMs: A Multi-Agent Framework for Cross-Domain Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series data is ubiquitous across various domains, including manufacturing, finance, and healthcare. High-quality annotations are essential for effectively understanding time series and facilitating downstream tasks; however, obtaining such annotations is challenging, particularly in mission-critical domains. In this paper, we propose TESSA, a multi-agent system designed to automatically generate both general and domain-specific annotations for time series data. TESSA introduces two agents: a general annotation agent and a domain-specific annotation agent. The general agent captures common patterns and knowledge across multiple source domains, leveraging both time-series-wise and text-wise features to generate general annotations. Meanwhile, the domain-specific agent utilizes limited annotations from the target domain to learn domain-specific terminology and generate targeted annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TESSA effectively generates high-quality annotations, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>VLSBench: Unveiling Visual Leakage in Multimodal Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety concerns of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gradually become an important problem in various applications. Surprisingly, previous works indicate a counterintuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to align MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs aligned with image text pairs. To explain such a phenomenon, we discover a Visual Safety Information Leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety benchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky content in the image has been revealed in the textual query. Thus, MLLMs can easily refuse these sensitive image-text pairs according to textual queries only, leading to unreliable cross-modality safety evaluation of MLLMs. We also conduct a further comparison experiment between textual alignment and multimodal alignment to highlight this drawback. To this end, we construct multimodal Visual Leakless Safety Bench (VLSBench) with 2.2k image-text pairs through an automated data pipeline. Experimental results indicate that VLSBench poses a significant challenge to both open-source and close-source MLLMs, e.g., LLaVA, Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o. Besides, we empirically compare textual and multimodal alignment methods on VLSBench and find that textual alignment is effective enough for multimodal safety scenarios with VSIL, while multimodal alignment is preferable for safety scenarios without VSIL. Code and data are released under https://github.com/AI45Lab/VLSBench</description>

      <title>Training-Free Bayesianization for Low-Rank Adapters of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the uncertainty of responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge. While recent Bayesian methods have demonstrated effectiveness in quantifying uncertainty through low-rank weight updates, they typically require complex fine-tuning or post-training procedures. In this paper, we propose Training-Free Bayesianization (TFB), a simple yet theoretically grounded framework that efficiently transforms trained low-rank adapters into Bayesian ones without additional training. TFB systematically searches for the maximally acceptable level of variance in the weight posterior, constrained within a family of low-rank isotropic Gaussian distributions. Our theoretical analysis shows that under mild conditions, this search process is equivalent to KL-regularized variational optimization, a generalized form of variational inference. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that TFB achieves superior uncertainty estimation and generalization compared to existing methods while eliminating the need for complex Bayesianization training procedures. Code will be available at https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/bayesian-peft.</description>

      <title>MMedPO: Aligning Medical Vision-Language Models with Clinical-Aware Multimodal Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available in https://github.com/aiming-lab/MMedPO.</description>

Abstract: A seminal paper published by Ledley and Lusted in 1959 introduced complex clinical diagnostic reasoning cases as the gold standard for the evaluation of expert medical computing systems, a standard that has held ever since. Here, we report the results of a physician evaluation of a large language model (LLM) on challenging clinical cases against a baseline of hundreds of physicians. We conduct five experiments to measure clinical reasoning across differential diagnosis generation, display of diagnostic reasoning, triage differential diagnosis, probabilistic reasoning, and management reasoning, all adjudicated by physician experts with validated psychometrics. We then report a real-world study comparing human expert and AI second opinions in randomly-selected patients in the emergency room of a major tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA. We compared LLMs and board-certified physicians at three predefined diagnostic touchpoints: triage in the emergency room, initial evaluation by a physician, and admission to the hospital or intensive care unit. In all experiments--both vignettes and emergency room second opinions--the LLM displayed superhuman diagnostic and reasoning abilities, as well as continued improvement from prior generations of AI clinical decision support. Our study suggests that LLMs have achieved superhuman performance on general medical diagnostic and management reasoning, fulfilling the vision put forth by Ledley and Lusted, and motivating the urgent need for prospective trials.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Driven Vision-Language Alignment with Minimal Human Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in integrating visual and linguistic information, but their performance is often constrained by the need for extensive, high-quality image-text training data. Curation of these image-text pairs is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce SVP (Sampling-based Visual Projection), a novel framework that enhances vision-language alignment without relying on manually curated text-image pairs or preference annotation. SVP leverages a small set of manually selected images, self-captioning and a pre-trained grounding model as a feedback mechanism to elicit latent information in VLMs. We evaluate our approach across six key areas: captioning, referring, visual question answering, multitasking, hallucination control, and object recall. Results demonstrate significant improvements, including a 14 % average improvement in captioning tasks, up to 12 % increase in object recall, and significantly reduced hallucinations, while maintaining question-answering capabilities. Using SVP, a small VLM achieves hallucination reductions similar to a model five times larger, while a VLM with initially poor referring capabilities more than doubles its performance, approaching parity with a model twice its size.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Length Bias In Preference Learning Via Response-Conditioned Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved considerable success in aligning large language models (LLMs) by modeling human preferences with a learnable reward model and employing a reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize the reward model's scores. However, these reward models are susceptible to exploitation through various superficial confounding factors, with length bias emerging as a particularly significant concern. Moreover, while the pronounced impact of length bias on preference modeling suggests that LLMs possess an inherent sensitivity to length perception, our preliminary investigations reveal that fine-tuned LLMs consistently struggle to adhere to explicit length instructions. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel framework wherein the reward model explicitly differentiates between human semantic preferences and response length requirements. Specifically, we introduce a $\textbf{R}$esponse-$\textbf{c}$onditioned $\textbf{B}$radley-$\textbf{T}$erry (Rc-BT) model that enhances the model's capability in length bias mitigating and length instruction following, through training on our augmented dataset. Furthermore, we propose the Rc-RM and Rc-DPO algorithm to leverage the Rc-BT model for reward modeling and direct policy optimization (DPO) of LLMs, simultaneously mitigating length bias and promoting adherence to length instructions. Extensive experiments across various foundational models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Explaining Context Length Scaling and Bounds for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long Context Language Models have drawn great attention in the past few years. There has been work discussing the impact of long context on Language Model performance: some find that long irrelevant context could harm performance, while some experimentally summarize loss reduction by relevant long context as Scaling Laws. This calls for a more thorough understanding on how long context impacts Language Modeling. In this work, we (1) propose a clean and effective theoretical framework for explaining the impact of context length on Language Modeling, from an Intrinsic Space perspective; and (2) conduct experiments on natural language and synthetic data, validating our proposed theoretical assumptions and deductions. Our theoretical framework can provide practical insights such as establishing that training dataset size dictates an optimal context length and bounds context length scaling for certain cases. We hope our work may inspire new long context Language Models, as well as future work studying Physics for Language Models. Code for our experiments is available at: https://github.com/JingzheShi/NLPCtlScalingAndBounds.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the true depth of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities at the cost of high compute requirements. Recent studies have demonstrated that intermediate layers in LLMs can be removed or reordered without substantial accuracy loss; however, this insight has not yet been exploited to improve inference efficiency. Leveraging observed layer independence, we propose a novel method that groups consecutive layers into pairs evaluated in parallel, effectively restructuring the computational graph to enhance parallelism. Without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, this approach achieves an inference throughput improvement of 1.05x-1.20x on standard benchmarks, retaining 95\%-99\% of the original model accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate the practicality of this method in significantly reducing inference cost for large-scale LLM deployment. Additionally, we demonstrate that modest performance degradation can be substantially mitigated through lightweight fine-tuning, further enhancing the method's applicability.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Encoder-free Architectures in 3D LMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Encoder-free architectures have been preliminarily explored in the 2D visual domain, yet it remains an open question whether they can be effectively applied to 3D understanding scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to alleviate the challenges of encoder-based 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). These challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud resolutions and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic needs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to remove the encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1) We propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training stage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And we present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract high-level semantics. 2) We introduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction tuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM layers to focus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the first Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL. Our 7B model rivals the current state-of-the-art model, ShapeLLM-13B, achieving 55.10%, 50.98%, and 43.10% on the classification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the encoder-free architecture is highly promising for replacing encoder-based architectures in the field of 3D understanding.

      <title>Table-Critic: A Multi-Agent Framework for Collaborative Criticism and Refinement in Table Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in various reasoning tasks, they still struggle with table reasoning tasks, particularly in maintaining consistency throughout multi-step reasoning processes. While existing approaches have explored various decomposition strategies, they often lack effective mechanisms to identify and correct errors in intermediate reasoning steps, leading to cascading error propagation. To address these issues, we propose Table-Critic, a novel multi-agent framework that facilitates collaborative criticism and iterative refinement of the reasoning process until convergence to correct solutions. Our framework consists of four specialized agents: a Judge for error identification, a Critic for comprehensive critiques, a Refiner for process improvement, and a Curator for pattern distillation. To effectively deal with diverse and unpredictable error types, we introduce a self-evolving template tree that systematically accumulates critique knowledge through experience-driven learning and guides future reflections. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that Table-Critic achieves substantial improvements over existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and error correction rates while maintaining computational efficiency and lower solution degradation rate.</description>

      <title>ARS: Automatic Routing Solver with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are characterized by a variety of practical constraints, making manual solver design both knowledge-intensive and time-consuming. Although there is increasing interest in automating the design of routing algorithms, existing research has explored only a limited array of VRP variants and fails to adequately address the complex and prevalent constraints encountered in real-world situations. To fill this gap, this paper introduces RoutBench, a benchmark of 1,000 VRP variants derived from 24 attributes, for evaluating the effectiveness of automatic routing solvers in addressing complex constraints. Along with RoutBench, we present the Automatic Routing Solver (ARS), which employs Large Language Model (LLM) agents to enhance a backbone algorithm framework by automatically generating constraint-aware heuristic code, based on problem descriptions and several representative constraints selected from a database. Our experiments show that ARS outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and commonly used solvers, automatically solving 91.67% of common VRPs and achieving at least a 30% improvement across all benchmarks.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Strength of Disagreement: Unraveling the Consensus-Diversity Tradeoff in Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consensus formation is pivotal in multi-agent systems (MAS), balancing collective coherence with individual diversity. Conventional LLM-based MAS primarily rely on explicit coordination, e.g., prompts or voting, risking premature homogenization. We argue that implicit consensus, where agents exchange information yet independently form decisions via in-context learning, can be more effective in dynamic environments that require long-horizon adaptability. By retaining partial diversity, systems can better explore novel strategies and cope with external shocks. We formalize a consensus-diversity tradeoff, showing conditions where implicit methods outperform explicit ones. Experiments on three scenarios -- Dynamic Disaster Response, Information Spread and Manipulation, and Dynamic Public-Goods Provision -- confirm partial deviation from group norms boosts exploration, robustness, and performance. We highlight emergent coordination via in-context learning, underscoring the value of preserving diversity for resilient decision-making.</description>

      <title>Vision-Encoders (Already) Know What They See: Mitigating Object Hallucination via Simple Fine-Grained CLIPScore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show remarkable performance across various domains. However, these models suffer from object hallucination. This study revisits the previous claim that the primary cause of such hallucination lies in the limited representational capacity of the vision encoder. Our analysis reveals that the capacity of the vision encoder itself is already adequate for detecting object hallucination. Based on this insight, we propose a Fine-grained CLIPScore (F-CLIPScore), a simple yet effective evaluation metric that enhances object-level granularity by incorporating text embeddings at the noun level. Evaluations on the OHD-Caps benchmark show that F-CLIPScore significantly outperforms conventional CLIPScore in accuracy by a large margin of 39.6\% without additional training. We further demonstrate that F-CLIPScore-based data filtering reduces object hallucination in LVLMs (4.9\% in POPE).</description>

      <title>A Pilot Empirical Study on When and How to Use Knowledge Graphs as Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework has attracted significant interest, with early studies showing promise in mitigating hallucinations and improving model accuracy. However, a systematic understanding and comparative analysis of the rapidly emerging KG-RAG methods are still lacking. This paper seeks to lay the foundation for systematically answering the question of when and how to use KG-RAG by analyzing their performance in various application scenarios associated with different technical configurations. After outlining the mind map using KG-RAG framework and summarizing its popular pipeline, we conduct a pilot empirical study of KG-RAG works to reimplement and evaluate 6 KG-RAG methods across 9 datasets in diverse domains and scenarios, analyzing the impact of 9 KG-RAG configurations in combination with 17 LLMs, and combining Metacognition with KG-RAG as a pilot attempt. Our results underscore the critical role of appropriate application conditions and optimal configurations of KG-RAG components.</description>

      <title>MAPS: Motivation-Aware Personalized Search via LLM-Driven Consultation Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01711v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized product search aims to retrieve and rank items that match users' preferences and search intent. Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches typically assume that users' query fully captures their real motivation. However, our analysis of a real-world e-commerce platform reveals that users often engage in relevant consultations before searching, indicating they refine intents through consultations based on motivation and need. The implied motivation in consultations is a key enhancing factor for personalized search. This unexplored area comes with new challenges including aligning contextual motivations with concise queries, bridging the category-text gap, and filtering noise within sequence history. To address these, we propose a Motivation-Aware Personalized Search (MAPS) method. It embeds queries and consultations into a unified semantic space via LLMs, utilizes a Mixture of Attention Experts (MoAE) to prioritize critical semantics, and introduces dual alignment: (1) contrastive learning aligns consultations, reviews, and product features; (2) bidirectional attention integrates motivation-aware embeddings with user preferences. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show MAPS outperforms existing methods in both retrieval and ranking tasks.</description>

      <title>Logic-in-Frames: Dynamic Keyframe Search via Visual Semantic-Logical Verification for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding long video content is a complex endeavor that often relies on densely sampled frame captions or end-to-end feature selectors, yet these techniques commonly overlook the logical relationships between textual queries and visual elements. In practice, computational constraints necessitate coarse frame subsampling, a challenge analogous to "finding a needle in a haystack." To address this issue, we introduce a semantics-driven search framework that reformulates keyframe selection under the paradigm of Visual Semantic-Logical Search. Specifically, we systematically define four fundamental logical dependencies: 1) spatial co-occurrence, 2) temporal proximity, 3) attribute dependency, and 4) causal order. These relations dynamically update frame sampling distributions through an iterative refinement process, enabling context-aware identification of semantically critical frames tailored to specific query requirements. Our method establishes new SOTA performance on the manually annotated benchmark in key-frame selection metrics. Furthermore, when applied to downstream video question-answering tasks, the proposed approach demonstrates the best performance gains over existing methods on LongVideoBench and Video-MME, validating its effectiveness in bridging the logical gap between textual queries and visual-temporal reasoning. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>DeLoRA: Decoupling Angles and Strength in Low-rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods have recently gained significant popularity thanks to the widespread availability of large-scale pretrained models. These methods allow for quick adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal computational cost. However, popular finetuning methods such as LoRA exhibit limited robustness when it comes to hyperparameter choices or extended training regimes, preventing optimal out-of-the-box performance. In contrast, bounded approaches, such as ETHER, provide greater robustness but are limited to extremely low-rank adaptations and fixed-strength transformations, reducing their adaptation expressive power. In this work, we propose Decoupled Low-rank Adaptation (DeLoRA), a novel finetuning method that normalizes and scales learnable low-rank matrices. By bounding the distance of the transformation, DeLoRA effectively decouples the angular learning from the adaptation strength, enhancing robustness without compromising performance. Through evaluations on subject-driven image generation, natural language understanding, and instruction tuning, we show that DeLoRA matches or surpasses performance of competing PEFT methods, while exhibiting stronger robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/DeLoRA.</description>

      <title>MaintainCoder: Maintainable Code Generation Under Dynamic Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern code generation has made significant strides in functional correctness and execution efficiency. However, these systems often overlook a critical dimension in real-world software development: \textit{maintainability}. To handle dynamic requirements with minimal rework, we propose \textbf{MaintainCoder} as a pioneering solution. It integrates the Waterfall model, design patterns, and multi-agent collaboration to systematically enhance cohesion, reduce coupling, achieving clear responsibility boundaries and better maintainability. We also introduce \textbf{MaintainBench}, a benchmark comprising requirement changes and novel dynamic metrics on maintenance efforts. Experiments demonstrate that existing code generation methods struggle to meet maintainability standards when requirements evolve. In contrast, MaintainCoder improves dynamic maintainability metrics by more than 60\% with even higher correctness of initial codes. Furthermore, while static metrics fail to accurately reflect maintainability and even contradict each other, our proposed dynamic metrics exhibit high consistency. Our work not only provides the foundation for maintainable code generation, but also highlights the need for more realistic and comprehensive code generation research.</description>

      <title>Effectively Controlling Reasoning Models through Thinking Intervention</title>

Abstract: Reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating final answers, helping the model excel in complex problem-solving. In this paper, we demonstrate that this emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained control over model behavior. We propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. We find that the Thinking Intervention paradigm enhances the capabilities of reasoning models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction following on IFEval, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on XSTest and SorryBench. Our results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7% accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, our work opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs.</description>

      <title>Prot42: a Novel Family of Protein Language Models for Target-aware Protein Binder Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlocking the next generation of biotechnology and therapeutic innovation demands overcoming the inherent complexity and resource-intensity of conventional protein engineering methods. Recent GenAI-powered computational techniques often rely on the availability of the target protein's 3D structures and specific binding sites to generate high-affinity binders, constraints exhibited by models such as AlphaProteo and RFdiffusion. In this work, we explore the use of Protein Language Models (pLMs) for high-affinity binder generation. We introduce Prot42, a novel family of Protein Language Models (pLMs) pretrained on vast amounts of unlabeled protein sequences. By capturing deep evolutionary, structural, and functional insights through an advanced auto-regressive, decoder-only architecture inspired by breakthroughs in natural language processing, Prot42 dramatically expands the capabilities of computational protein design based on language only. Remarkably, our models handle sequences up to 8,192 amino acids, significantly surpassing standard limitations and enabling precise modeling of large proteins and complex multi-domain sequences. Demonstrating powerful practical applications, Prot42 excels in generating high-affinity protein binders and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Our innovative models are publicly available, offering the scientific community an efficient and precise computational toolkit for rapid protein engineering.</description>

      <title>Signatures of human-like processing in Transformer forward passes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern AI models are increasingly being used as theoretical tools to study human cognition. One dominant approach is to evaluate whether human-derived measures are predicted by a model's output: that is, the end-product of a forward pass. However, recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have begun to reveal the internal processes that give rise to model outputs, raising the question of whether models might use human-like processing strategies. Here, we investigate the relationship between real-time processing in humans and layer-time dynamics of computation in Transformers, testing 20 open-source models in 6 domains. We first explore whether forward passes show mechanistic signatures of competitor interference, taking high-level inspiration from cognitive theories. We find that models indeed appear to initially favor a competing incorrect answer in the cases where we would expect decision conflict in humans. We then systematically test whether forward-pass dynamics predict signatures of processing in humans, above and beyond properties of the model's output probability distribution. We find that dynamic measures improve prediction of human processing measures relative to static final-layer measures. Moreover, across our experiments, larger models do not always show more human-like processing patterns. Our work suggests a new way of using AI models to study human cognition: not just as a black box mapping stimuli to responses, but potentially also as explicit processing models.</description>

      <title>AlignRAG: Leveraging Critique Learning for Evidence-Sensitive Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted paradigm for enabling knowledge-grounded large language models (LLMs). However, standard RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that model reasoning remains consistent with the evidence retrieved, leading to factual inconsistencies or unsupported conclusions. In this work, we reinterpret RAG as Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning and identify a central but underexplored problem: \textit{Reasoning Misalignment}-the divergence between an LLM's internal reasoning trajectory and the evidential constraints provided by retrieval. To address this issue, we propose \textsc{AlignRAG}, a novel iterative framework grounded in Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA). At the heart of \textsc{AlignRAG} lies a \textit{contrastive critique synthesis} mechanism that generates retrieval-sensitive critiques while mitigating self-bias. This mechanism trains a dedicated retrieval-augmented \textit{Critic Language Model (CLM)} using labeled critiques that distinguish between evidence-aligned and misaligned reasoning. Alignment signals for supervision are obtained through self-supervised or externally guided labeling strategies. The resulting CLM is explicitly optimized for evidence sensitivity, enabling it to detect and revise reasoning errors during inference without relying solely on self-generated feedback. Empirical evaluations show that our 8B-parameter CLM improves performance over the Self-Refine baseline by 12.1\% on out-of-domain tasks and outperforms a standard 72B-parameter CLM by 2.2\%, while remaining compatible with existing RAG architectures as a plug-and-play module. Overall, AlignRAG offers a principled solution for aligning model reasoning with retrieved evidence, substantially improving the factual reliability and robustness of RAG systems.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey in LLM(-Agent) Full Stack Safety: Data, Training and Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.</description>

      <title>Process Reward Models That Think</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training. Our code, data, and models will be released at https://github.com/mukhal/thinkprm.</description>

      <title>Self-Generated In-Context Examples Improve LLM Agents for Sequential Decision-Making Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential decision-making tasks typically requires extensive task-specific knowledge engineering--custom prompts, curated examples, and specialized observation/action spaces. We investigate a different approach where agents automatically improve by learning from their own successful experiences without human intervention. Our method constructs and refines a database of self-generated trajectories that serve as in-context examples for future tasks. Even naive accumulation of successful trajectories yields substantial performance gains across three diverse benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%), and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%). These improvements exceed those achieved by upgrading from gpt-4o-mini to gpt-4o and match the performance of allowing multiple attempts per task. We further enhance this approach with two innovations: database-level curation using population-based training to propagate high-performing example collections, and exemplar-level curation that selectively retains trajectories based on their empirical utility as in-context examples. With these enhancements, our method achieves 93% success on ALFWorld--surpassing approaches that use more powerful LLMs and hand-crafted components. Our trajectory bootstrapping technique demonstrates that agents can autonomously improve through experience, offering a scalable alternative to labor-intensive knowledge engineering.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization. Our code repository is available at https://github.com/x66ccff/swarmbench.</description>

      <title>TRAIL: Trace Reasoning and Agentic Issue Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval. Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows.</description>

      <title>CXMArena: Unified Dataset to benchmark performance in realistic CXM Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense potential for revolutionizing Customer Experience Management (CXM), particularly in contact center operations. However, evaluating their practical utility in complex operational environments is hindered by data scarcity (due to privacy concerns) and the limitations of current benchmarks. Existing benchmarks often lack realism, failing to incorporate deep knowledge base (KB) integration, real-world noise, or critical operational tasks beyond conversational fluency. To bridge this gap, we introduce CXMArena, a novel, large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset specifically designed for evaluating AI in operational CXM contexts. Given the diversity in possible contact center features, we have developed a scalable LLM-powered pipeline that simulates the brand's CXM entities that form the foundation of our datasets-such as knowledge articles including product specifications, issue taxonomies, and contact center conversations. The entities closely represent real-world distribution because of controlled noise injection (informed by domain experts) and rigorous automated validation. Building on this, we release CXMArena, which provides dedicated benchmarks targeting five important operational tasks: Knowledge Base Refinement, Intent Prediction, Agent Quality Adherence, Article Search, and Multi-turn RAG with Integrated Tools. Our baseline experiments underscore the benchmark's difficulty: even state of the art embedding and generation models achieve only 68% accuracy on article search, while standard embedding methods yield a low F1 score of 0.3 for knowledge base refinement, highlighting significant challenges for current models necessitating complex pipelines and solutions over conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Learning Virtual Machine Scheduling in Cloud Computing through Language Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cloud services, virtual machine (VM) scheduling is a typical Online Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, characterized by large-scale complexity and fluctuating demands. Traditional optimization methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer. Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\% competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and large-scale cloud environments.</description>

      <title>Superposition Yields Robust Neural Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e., representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other, the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>MASSV: Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10526</link>

Abstract: Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by enabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger target model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions. Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both current and future VLMs.</description>

      <title>Two Minds Better Than One: Collaborative Reward Modeling for LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, noisy preferences in human feedback can lead to reward misgeneralization - a phenomenon where reward models learn spurious correlations or overfit to noisy preferences, which poses important challenges to the generalization of RMs. This paper systematically analyzes the characteristics of preference pairs and aims to identify how noisy preferences differ from human-aligned preferences in reward modeling. Our analysis reveals that noisy preferences are difficult for RMs to fit, as they cause sharp training fluctuations and irregular gradient updates. These distinctive dynamics suggest the feasibility of identifying and excluding such noisy preferences. Empirical studies demonstrate that policy LLM optimized with a reward model trained on the full preference dataset, which includes substantial noise, performs worse than the one trained on a subset of exclusively high quality preferences. To address this challenge, we propose an online Collaborative Reward Modeling (CRM) framework to achieve robust preference learning through peer review and curriculum learning. In particular, CRM maintains two RMs that collaboratively filter potential noisy preferences by peer-reviewing each other's data selections. Curriculum learning synchronizes the capabilities of two models, mitigating excessive disparities to promote the utility of peer review. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRM significantly enhances RM generalization, with up to 9.94 points improvement on RewardBench under an extreme 40\% noise. Moreover, CRM can seamlessly extend to implicit-reward alignment methods, offering a robust and versatile alignment strategy.</description>

      <title>Creating General User Models from Computer Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human-computer interaction has long imagined technology that understands us-from our preferences and habits, to the timing and purpose of our everyday actions. Yet current user models remain fragmented, narrowly tailored to specific apps, and incapable of the flexible reasoning required to fulfill these visions. This paper presents an architecture for a general user model (GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your computer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g., device screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that capture user knowledge and preferences. GUMs can infer that a user is preparing for a wedding they're attending from messages with a friend. Or recognize that a user is struggling with a collaborator's feedback on a draft by observing multiple stalled edits and a switch to reading related work. GUMs introduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from multimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and continuously revises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of applications that GUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based assistants with context, manage OS notifications to selectively surface important information, and enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences across apps. We also instantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover and execute useful suggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM. In our evaluations, we find that GUMs make calibrated and accurate inferences about users, and that assistants built on GUMs proactively identify and perform actions that users wouldn't think to request explicitly. Altogether, GUMs introduce methods that leverage multimodal models to understand unstructured context, enabling long-standing visions of HCI and entirely new interactive systems that anticipate user needs.</description>

      <title>REI-Bench: Can Embodied Agents Understand Vague Human Instructions in Task Planning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10872</link>

Abstract: Robot task planning decomposes human instructions into executable action sequences that enable robots to complete a series of complex tasks. Although recent large language model (LLM)-based task planners achieve amazing performance, they assume that human instructions are clear and straightforward. However, real-world users are not experts, and their instructions to robots often contain significant vagueness. Linguists suggest that such vagueness frequently arises from referring expressions (REs), whose meanings depend heavily on dialogue context and environment. This vagueness is even more prevalent among the elderly and children, who robots should serve more. This paper studies how such vagueness in REs within human instructions affects LLM-based robot task planning and how to overcome this issue. To this end, we propose the first robot task planning benchmark with vague REs (REI-Bench), where we discover that the vagueness of REs can severely degrade robot planning performance, leading to success rate drops of up to 77.9%. We also observe that most failure cases stem from missing objects in planners. To mitigate the REs issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach: task-oriented context cognition, which generates clear instructions for robots, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to aware prompt and chains of thought. This work contributes to the research community of human-robot interaction (HRI) by making robot task planning more practical, particularly for non-expert users, e.g., the elderly and children.</description>

      <title>Phare: A Safety Probe for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical for responsible deployment, yet existing evaluations often prioritize performance over identifying failure modes. We introduce Phare, a multilingual diagnostic framework to probe and evaluate LLM behavior across three critical dimensions: hallucination and reliability, social biases, and harmful content generation. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals patterns of systematic vulnerabilities across all safety dimensions, including sycophancy, prompt sensitivity, and stereotype reproduction. By highlighting these specific failure modes rather than simply ranking models, Phare provides researchers and practitioners with actionable insights to build more robust, aligned, and trustworthy language systems.</description>
