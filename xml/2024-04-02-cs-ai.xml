      <title>Leveraging Counterfactual Paths for Contrastive Explanations of POMDP Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As humans come to rely on autonomous systems more, ensuring the transparency of such systems is important to their continued adoption. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to reduce confusion and foster trust in systems by providing explanations of agent behavior. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a flexible framework capable of reasoning over transition and state uncertainty, while also being amenable to explanation. This work investigates the use of user-provided counterfactuals to generate contrastive explanations of POMDP policies. Feature expectations are used as a means of contrasting the performance of these policies. We demonstrate our approach in a Search and Rescue (SAR) setting. We analyze and discuss the associated challenges through two case studies.</description>

      <title>Bespoke Large Language Models for Digital Triage Assistance in Mental Health Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary large language models (LLMs) may have utility for processing unstructured, narrative free-text clinical data contained in electronic health records (EHRs) -- a particularly important use-case for mental health where a majority of routinely-collected patient data lacks structured, machine-readable content.
  A significant problem for the the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) are the long waiting lists for specialist mental healthcare. According to NHS data, in each month of 2023, there were between 370,000 and 470,000 individual new referrals into secondary mental healthcare services. Referrals must be triaged by clinicians, using clinical information contained in the patient's EHR to arrive at a decision about the most appropriate mental healthcare team to assess and potentially treat these patients.
  The ability to efficiently recommend a relevant team by ingesting potentially voluminous clinical notes could help services both reduce referral waiting times and with the right technology, improve the evidence available to justify triage decisions.
  We present and evaluate three different approaches for LLM-based, end-to-end ingestion of variable-length clinical EHR data to assist clinicians when triaging referrals. Our model is able to deliver triage recommendations consistent with existing clinical practices and it's architecture was implemented on a single GPU, making it practical for implementation in resource-limited NHS environments where private implementations of LLM technology will be necessary to ensure confidential clinical data is appropriately controlled and governed.</description>

      <title>Segmentation Re-thinking Uncertainty Estimation Metrics for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of computer vision, semantic segmentation emerges as a fundamental application within machine learning, wherein individual pixels of an image are classified into distinct semantic categories. This task transcends traditional accuracy metrics by incorporating uncertainty quantification, a critical measure for assessing the reliability of each segmentation prediction. Such quantification is instrumental in facilitating informed decision-making, particularly in applications where precision is paramount. Within this nuanced framework, the metric known as PAvPU (Patch Accuracy versus Patch Uncertainty) has been developed as a specialized tool for evaluating entropy-based uncertainty in image segmentation tasks. However, our investigation identifies three core deficiencies within the PAvPU framework and proposes robust solutions aimed at refining the metric. By addressing these issues, we aim to enhance the reliability and applicability of uncertainty quantification, especially in scenarios that demand high levels of safety and accuracy, thus contributing to the advancement of semantic segmentation methodologies in critical applications.</description>

      <title>Towards a Brazilian History Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short paper describes the first steps in a project to construct a knowledge graph for Brazilian history based on the Brazilian Dictionary of Historical Biographies (DHBB) and Wikipedia/Wikidata. We contend that large repositories of Brazilian-named entities (people, places, organizations, and political events and movements) would be beneficial for extracting information from Portuguese texts. We show that many of the terms/entities described in the DHBB do not have corresponding concepts (or Q items) in Wikidata, the largest structured database of entities associated with Wikipedia. We describe previous work on extracting information from the DHBB and outline the steps to construct a Wikidata-based historical knowledge graph.</description>

      <title>LLMSense: Harnessing LLMs for High-level Reasoning Over Spatiotemporal Sensor Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most studies on machine learning in sensing systems focus on low-level perception tasks that process raw sensory data within a short time window. However, many practical applications, such as human routine modeling and occupancy tracking, require high-level reasoning abilities to comprehend concepts and make inferences based on long-term sensor traces. Existing machine learning-based approaches for handling such complex tasks struggle to generalize due to the limited training samples and the high dimensionality of sensor traces, necessitating the integration of human knowledge for designing first-principle models or logic reasoning methods. We pose a fundamental question: Can we harness the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize complex events from long-term spatiotemporal sensor traces? To answer this question, we design an effective prompting framework for LLMs on high-level reasoning tasks, which can handle traces from the raw sensor data as well as the low-level perception results. We also design two strategies to enhance performance with long sensor traces, including summarization before reasoning and selective inclusion of historical traces. Our framework can be implemented in an edge-cloud setup, running small LLMs on the edge for data summarization and performing high-level reasoning on the cloud for privacy preservation. The results show that LLMSense can achieve over 80\% accuracy on two high-level reasoning tasks such as dementia diagnosis with behavior traces and occupancy tracking with environmental sensor traces. This paper provides a few insights and guidelines for leveraging LLM for high-level reasoning on sensor traces and highlights several directions for future work.</description>

      <title>IME: Integrating Multi-curvature Shared and Specific Embedding for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) incorporate a temporal dimension, allowing for a precise capture of the evolution of knowledge and reflecting the dynamic nature of the real world. Typically, TKGs contain complex geometric structures, with various geometric structures interwoven. However, existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) methods either model TKGs in a single space or neglect the heterogeneity of different curvature spaces, thus constraining their capacity to capture these intricate geometric structures. In this paper, we propose a novel Integrating Multi-curvature shared and specific Embedding (IME) model for TKGC tasks. Concretely, IME models TKGs into multi-curvature spaces, including hyperspherical, hyperbolic, and Euclidean spaces. Subsequently, IME incorporates two key properties, namely space-shared property and space-specific property. The space-shared property facilitates the learning of commonalities across different curvature spaces and alleviates the spatial gap caused by the heterogeneous nature of multi-curvature spaces, while the space-specific property captures characteristic features. Meanwhile, IME proposes an Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling (AMP) approach to effectively retain important information. Furthermore, IME innovatively designs similarity, difference, and structure loss functions to attain the stated objective. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the superior performance of IME over existing state-of-the-art TKGC models.</description>

      <title>Policy-Space Search: Equivalences, Improvements, and Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully-observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning is at the core of artificial intelligence planning with uncertainty. It models uncertainty through actions with non-deterministic effects. A* with Non-Determinism (AND*) (Messa and Pereira, 2023) is a FOND planner that generalizes A* (Hart et al., 1968) for FOND planning. It searches for a solution policy by performing an explicit heuristic search on the policy space of the FOND task. In this paper, we study and improve the performance of the policy-space search performed by AND*. We present a polynomial-time procedure that constructs a solution policy given just the set of states that should be mapped. This procedure, together with a better understanding of the structure of FOND policies, allows us to present three concepts of equivalences between policies. We use policy equivalences to prune part of the policy search space, making AND* substantially more effective in solving FOND tasks. We also study the impact of taking into account structural state-space symmetries to strengthen the detection of equivalence policies and the impact of performing the search with satisficing techniques. We apply a recent technique from the group theory literature to better compute structural state-space symmetries. Finally, we present a solution compressor that, given a policy defined over complete states, finds a policy that unambiguously represents it using the minimum number of partial states. AND* with the introduced techniques generates, on average, two orders of magnitude fewer policies to solve FOND tasks. These techniques allow explicit policy-space search to be competitive in terms of both coverage and solution compactness with other state-of-the-art FOND planners.</description>

      <title>Diverse Feature Learning by Self-distillation and Reset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our paper addresses the problem of models struggling to learn diverse features, due to either forgetting previously learned features or failing to learn new ones. To overcome this problem, we introduce Diverse Feature Learning (DFL), a method that combines an important feature preservation algorithm with a new feature learning algorithm. Specifically, for preserving important features, we utilize self-distillation in ensemble models by selecting the meaningful model weights observed during training. For learning new features, we employ reset that involves periodically re-initializing part of the model. As a result, through experiments with various models on the image classification, we have identified the potential for synergistic effects between self-distillation and reset.</description>

      <title>MindArm: Mechanized Intelligent Non-Invasive Neuro-Driven Prosthetic Arm System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, people with disability or difficulty to move their arms (referred to as "patients") have very limited technological solutions to efficiently address their physiological limitations. It is mainly due to two reasons: (1) the non-invasive solutions like mind-controlled prosthetic devices are typically very costly and require expensive maintenance; and (2) other solutions require costly invasive brain surgery, which is high risk to perform, expensive, and difficult to maintain. Therefore, current technological solutions are not accessible for all patients with different financial backgrounds. Toward this, we propose a low-cost technological solution called MindArm, a mechanized intelligent non-invasive neuro-driven prosthetic arm system. Our MindArm system employs a deep neural network (DNN) engine to translate brain signals into the intended prosthetic arm motion, thereby helping patients to perform many activities despite their physiological limitations. Here, our MindArm system utilizes widely accessible and low-cost surface electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes coupled with an Open Brain Computer Interface and UDP networking for acquiring brain signals and transmitting them to the compute module for signal processing. In the compute module, we run a trained DNN model to interpret normalized micro-voltage of the brain signals, and then translate them into a prosthetic arm action via serial communication seamlessly. The experimental results on a fully working prototype demonstrate that, from the three defined actions, our MindArm system achieves positive success rates, i.e., 91\% for idle/stationary, 85\% for shake hand, and 84\% for pick-up cup. This demonstrates that our MindArm provides a novel approach for an alternate low-cost mind-controlled prosthetic devices for all patients.</description>

      <title>Development of Compositionality and Generalization through Interactive Learning of Language and Action of Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans excel at applying learned behavior to unlearned situations. A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic. "How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns?" To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference, based on the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions, is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced significantly by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuo-motor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.</description>

      <title>Implications of the AI Act for Non-Discrimination Law and Algorithmic Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topic of fairness in AI, as debated in the FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics in AI) communities, has sparked meaningful discussions in the past years. However, from a legal perspective, particularly from European Union law, many open questions remain. Whereas algorithmic fairness aims to mitigate structural inequalities at the design level, European non-discrimination law is tailored to individual cases of discrimination after an AI model has been deployed. The AI Act might present a tremendous step towards bridging these two concepts by shifting non-discrimination responsibilities into the design stage of AI models. Based on an integrative reading of the AI Act, we comment on legal as well as technical enforcement problems and propose practical implications on bias detection and bias correction in order to specify and comply with specific technical requirements.</description>

      <title>ITCMA: A Generative Agent Based on a Computational Consciousness Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges in tasks requiring understanding implicit instructions and applying common-sense knowledge. In such scenarios, LLMs may require multiple attempts to achieve human-level performance, potentially leading to inaccurate responses or inferences in practical environments, affecting their long-term consistency and behavior. This paper introduces the Internal Time-Consciousness Machine (ITCM), a computational consciousness structure. We further propose the ITCM-based Agent (ITCMA), which supports behavior generation and reasoning in open-world settings. ITCMA enhances LLMs' ability to understand implicit instructions and apply common-sense knowledge by considering agents' interaction and reasoning with the environment. Evaluations in the Alfworld environment show that trained ITCMA outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 9% on the seen set. Even untrained ITCMA achieves a 96% task completion rate on the seen set, 5% higher than SOTA, indicating its superiority over traditional intelligent agents in utility and generalization. In real-world tasks with quadruped robots, the untrained ITCMA achieves an 85% task completion rate, which is close to its performance in the unseen set, demonstrating its comparable utility in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Prompts on Zero-Shot Detection of AI-Generated Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). While their practical applications are now widespread, their potential for misuse, such as generating fake news and committing plagiarism, has posed significant concerns. To address this issue, detectors have been developed to evaluate whether a given text is human-generated or AI-generated. Among others, zero-shot detectors stand out as effective approaches that do not require additional training data and are often likelihood-based. In chat-based applications, users commonly input prompts and utilize the AI-generated texts. However, zero-shot detectors typically analyze these texts in isolation, neglecting the impact of the original prompts. It is conceivable that this approach may lead to a discrepancy in likelihood assessments between the text generation phase and the detection phase. So far, there remains an unverified gap concerning how the presence or absence of prompts impacts detection accuracy for zero-shot detectors. In this paper, we introduce an evaluative framework to empirically analyze the impact of prompts on the detection accuracy of AI-generated text. We assess various zero-shot detectors using both white-box detection, which leverages the prompt, and black-box detection, which operates without prompt information. Our experiments reveal the significant influence of prompts on detection accuracy. Remarkably, compared with black-box detection without prompts, the white-box methods using prompts demonstrate an increase in AUC of at least $0.1$ across all zero-shot detectors tested.

      <title>Accurate Block Quantization in LLMs with Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for inference on extremely large scale LLMs has seen enormous growth in the recent months. It made evident the colossal shortage of dedicated hardware capable of efficient and fast processing of the involved compute and memory movement. The problem is aggravated by the exploding raise in the lengths of the sequences being processed, since those require efficient on-chip storage of the KV-cache of size proportional to the sequence length. To make the required compute feasible and fit the involved data into available memory, numerous quantization techniques have been proposed that allow accurate quantization for both weights and activations. One of the main recent breakthroughs in this direction was introduction of the family of Block Floating Point (BFP) formats characterized by a block of mantissas with a shared scale factor. These enable memory- power-, and compute- efficient hardware support of the tensor operations and provide extremely good quantization accuracy. The main issues preventing widespread application of block formats is caused by the presence of outliers in weights and activations since those affect the accuracy of the other values in the same block. In this paper, we focus on the most critical problem of limited KV-cache storage. We propose a novel approach enabling usage of low precision BFP formats without compromising the resulting model accuracy. We exploit the common channel-wise patterns exhibited by the outliers to rearrange them in such a way, that their quantization quality is significantly improved. The methodology yields 2x savings in the memory footprint without significant degradation of the model's accuracy. Importantly, the rearrangement of channels happens at the compile time and thus has no impact on the inference latency.</description>

      <title>A Learning-based Incentive Mechanism for Mobile AIGC Service in Decentralized Internet of Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) refers to the paradigm of automated content generation utilizing AI models. Mobile AIGC services in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network have numerous advantages over traditional cloud-based AIGC services, including enhanced network efficiency, better reconfigurability, and stronger data security and privacy. Nonetheless, AIGC service provisioning frequently demands significant resources. Consequently, resource-constrained roadside units (RSUs) face challenges in maintaining a heterogeneous pool of AIGC services and addressing all user service requests without degrading overall performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a decentralized incentive mechanism for mobile AIGC service allocation, employing multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to find the balance between the supply of AIGC services on RSUs and user demand for services within the IoV context, optimizing user experience and minimizing transmission latency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to other baseline models.</description>

      <title>Artificial consciousness. Some logical and conceptual preliminaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is artificial consciousness theoretically possible? Is it plausible? If so, is it technically feasible? To make progress on these questions, it is necessary to lay some groundwork clarifying the logical and empirical conditions for artificial consciousness to arise and the meaning of relevant terms involved. Consciousness is a polysemic word: researchers from different fields, including neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and philosophy, among others, sometimes use different terms in order to refer to the same phenomena or the same terms to refer to different phenomena. In fact, if we want to pursue artificial consciousness, a proper definition of the key concepts is required. Here, after some logical and conceptual preliminaries, we argue for the necessity of using dimensions and profiles of consciousness for a balanced discussion about their possible instantiation or realisation in artificial systems. Our primary goal in this paper is to review the main theoretical questions that arise in the domain of artificial consciousness. On the basis of this review, we propose to assess the issue of artificial consciousness within a multidimensional account. The theoretical possibility of artificial consciousness is already presumed within some theoretical frameworks; however, empirical possibility cannot simply be deduced from these frameworks but needs independent empirical validation. We break down the complexity of consciousness by identifying constituents, components, and dimensions, and reflect pragmatically about the general challenges confronting the creation of artificial consciousness. Despite these challenges, we outline a research strategy for showing how "awareness" as we propose to understand it could plausibly be realised in artificial systems.</description>

      <title>The Future of Combating Rumors? Retrieval, Discrimination, and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technology development has facilitated the creation of rumors with misinformation, impacting societal, economic, and political ecosystems, challenging democracy. Current rumor detection efforts fall short by merely labeling potentially misinformation (classification task), inadequately addressing the issue, and it is unrealistic to have authoritative institutions debunk every piece of information on social media. Our proposed comprehensive debunking process not only detects rumors but also provides explanatory generated content to refute the authenticity of the information. The Expert-Citizen Collective Wisdom (ECCW) module we designed aensures high-precision assessment of the credibility of information and the retrieval module is responsible for retrieving relevant knowledge from a Real-time updated debunking database based on information keywords. By using prompt engineering techniques, we feed results and knowledge into a LLM (Large Language Model), achieving satisfactory discrimination and explanatory effects while eliminating the need for fine-tuning, saving computational costs, and contributing to debunking efforts.</description>

      <title>On Size and Hardness Generalization in Unsupervised Learning for the Travelling Salesman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalization capability of Unsupervised Learning in solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). We use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) trained with a surrogate loss function to generate an embedding for each node. We use these embeddings to construct a heat map that indicates the likelihood of each edge being part of the optimal route. We then apply local search to generate our final predictions. Our investigation explores how different training instance sizes, embedding dimensions, and distributions influence the outcomes of Unsupervised Learning methods. Our results show that training with larger instance sizes and increasing embedding dimensions can build a more effective representation, enhancing the model's ability to solve TSP. Furthermore, in evaluating generalization across different distributions, we first determine the hardness of various distributions and explore how different hardnesses affect the final results. Our findings suggest that models trained on harder instances exhibit better generalization capabilities, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate training instances in solving TSP using Unsupervised Learning.</description>

      <title>Artificial Neural Networks-based Real-time Classification of ENG Signals for Implanted Nerve Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuropathies are gaining higher relevance in clinical settings, as they risk permanently jeopardizing a person's life. To support the recovery of patients, the use of fully implanted devices is emerging as one of the most promising solutions. However, these devices, even if becoming an integral part of a fully complex neural nanonetwork system, pose numerous challenges. In this article, we address one of them, which consists of the classification of motor/sensory stimuli. The task is performed by exploring four different types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to extract various sensory stimuli from the electroneurographic (ENG) signal measured in the sciatic nerve of rats. Different sizes of the data sets are considered to analyze the feasibility of the investigated ANNs for real-time classification through a comparison of their performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and prediction time. The design of the ANNs takes advantage of the modelling of the ENG signal as a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system to describe the measures taken by state-of-the-art implanted nerve interfaces. These are based on the use of multi-contact cuff electrodes to achieve nanoscale spatial discrimination of the nerve activity. The MIMO ENG signal model is another contribution of this paper. Our results show that some ANNs are more suitable for real-time applications, being capable of achieving accuracies over $90\%$ for signal windows of $100$ and $200\,$ms with a low enough processing time to be effective for pathology recovery.</description>

      <title>Towards Greener LLMs: Bringing Energy-Efficiency to the Forefront of LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ubiquitous use of modern large language models (LLMs) across industries, the inference serving for these models is ever expanding. Given the high compute and memory requirements of modern LLMs, more and more top-of-the-line GPUs are being deployed to serve these models. Energy availability has come to the forefront as the biggest challenge for data center expansion to serve these models. In this paper, we present the trade-offs brought up by making energy efficiency the primary goal of LLM serving under performance SLOs. We show that depending on the inputs, the model, and the service-level agreements, there are several knobs available to the LLM inference provider to use for being energy efficient. We characterize the impact of these knobs on the latency, throughput, as well as the energy. By exploring these trade-offs, we offer valuable insights into optimizing energy usage without compromising on performance, thereby paving the way for sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment in data center environments.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Roles of Language and Vision in Learning from Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Does language help make sense of the visual world? How important is it to actually see the world rather than having it described with words? These basic questions about the nature of intelligence have been difficult to answer because we only had one example of an intelligent system -- humans -- and limited access to cases that isolated language or vision. However, the development of sophisticated Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by artificial intelligence researchers offers us new opportunities to explore the contributions that language and vision make to learning about the world. We ablate components from the cognitive architecture of these models to identify their contributions to learning new tasks from limited data. We find that a language model leveraging all components recovers a majority of a VLM's performance, despite its lack of visual input, and that language seems to allow this by providing access to prior knowledge and reasoning.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Recurrent Adapters for Efficient Multi-Task Adaptation of Large Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter efficient adaptation methods have become a key mechanism to train large pre-trained models for downstream tasks. However, their per-task parameter overhead is considered still high when the number of downstream tasks to adapt for is large. We introduce an adapter module that has a better efficiency in large scale multi-task adaptation scenario. Our adapter is hierarchical in terms of how the adapter parameters are allocated. The adapter consists of a single shared controller network and multiple task-level adapter heads to reduce the per-task parameter overhead without performance regression on downstream tasks. The adapter is also recurrent so the entire adapter parameters are reused across different layers of the pre-trained model. Our Hierarchical Recurrent Adapter (HRA) outperforms the previous adapter-based approaches as well as full model fine-tuning baseline in both single and multi-task adaptation settings when evaluated on automatic speech recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>STRUM-LLM: Attributed and Structured Contrastive Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Users often struggle with decision-making between two options (A vs B), as it usually requires time-consuming research across multiple web pages. We propose STRUM-LLM that addresses this challenge by generating attributed, structured, and helpful contrastive summaries that highlight key differences between the two options. STRUM-LLM identifies helpful contrast: the specific attributes along which the two options differ significantly and which are most likely to influence the user's decision. Our technique is domain-agnostic, and does not require any human-labeled data or fixed attribute list as supervision. STRUM-LLM attributes all extractions back to the input sources along with textual evidence, and it does not have a limit on the length of input sources that it can process. STRUM-LLM Distilled has 100x more throughput than the models with comparable performance while being 10x smaller. In this paper, we provide extensive evaluations for our method and lay out future directions for our currently deployed system.</description>

      <title>Capability-aware Prompt Reformulation Learning for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation systems have emerged as revolutionary tools in the realm of artistic creation, offering unprecedented ease in transforming textual prompts into visual art. However, the efficacy of these systems is intricately linked to the quality of user-provided prompts, which often poses a challenge to users unfamiliar with prompt crafting. This paper addresses this challenge by leveraging user reformulation data from interaction logs to develop an automatic prompt reformulation model. Our in-depth analysis of these logs reveals that user prompt reformulation is heavily dependent on the individual user's capability, resulting in significant variance in the quality of reformulation pairs. To effectively use this data for training, we introduce the Capability-aware Prompt Reformulation (CAPR) framework. CAPR innovatively integrates user capability into the reformulation process through two key components: the Conditional Reformulation Model (CRM) and Configurable Capability Features (CCF). CRM reformulates prompts according to a specified user capability, as represented by CCF. The CCF, in turn, offers the flexibility to tune and guide the CRM's behavior. This enables CAPR to effectively learn diverse reformulation strategies across various user capacities and to simulate high-capability user reformulation during inference. Extensive experiments on standard text-to-image generation benchmarks showcase CAPR's superior performance over existing baselines and its remarkable robustness on unseen systems. Furthermore, comprehensive analyses validate the effectiveness of different components. CAPR can facilitate user-friendly interaction with text-to-image systems and make advanced artistic creation more achievable for a broader range of users.</description>

      <title>Computationally and Memory-Efficient Robust Predictive Analytics Using Big Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current data-intensive era, big data has become a significant asset for Artificial Intelligence (AI), serving as a foundation for developing data-driven models and providing insight into various unknown fields. This study navigates through the challenges of data uncertainties, storage limitations, and predictive data-driven modeling using big data. We utilize Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) for effective noise reduction and outlier elimination, and Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP) for efficient data compression and storage. The proposed OSP technique enables data compression without substantial information loss while simultaneously reducing storage needs. While RPCA offers an enhanced alternative to traditional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for high-dimensional data management, the scope of this work extends its utilization, focusing on robust, data-driven modeling applicable to huge data sets in real-time. For that purpose, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, are applied to model and predict data based on a low-dimensional subset obtained from OSP, leading to a crucial acceleration of the training phase. LSTMs are feasible for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data, making them particularly suited for predicting the future states of physical systems on historical data. All the presented algorithms are not only theorized but also simulated and validated using real thermal imaging data mapping a ship's engine.</description>

Abstract: Table understanding (TU) has achieved promising advancements, but it faces the challenges of the scarcity of manually labeled tables and the presence of complex table structures.To address these challenges, we propose HGT, a framework with a heterogeneous graph (HG)-enhanced large language model (LLM) to tackle few-shot TU tasks.It leverages the LLM by aligning the table semantics with the LLM's parametric knowledge through soft prompts and instruction turning and deals with complex tables by a multi-task pre-training scheme involving three novel multi-granularity self-supervised HG pre-training objectives.We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of HGT, showing that it outperforms the SOTA for few-shot complex TU on several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MUGC: Machine Generated versus User Generated Content Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As advanced modern systems like deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI continue to enhance their capabilities in producing convincing and realistic content, the need to distinguish between user-generated and machine generated content is becoming increasingly evident. In this research, we undertake a comparative evaluation of eight traditional machine-learning algorithms to distinguish between machine-generated and human-generated data across three diverse datasets: Poems, Abstracts, and Essays. Our results indicate that traditional methods demonstrate a high level of accuracy in identifying machine-generated data, reflecting the documented effectiveness of popular pre-trained models like RoBERT. We note that machine-generated texts tend to be shorter and exhibit less word variety compared to human-generated content. While specific domain-related keywords commonly utilized by humans, albeit disregarded by current LLMs (Large Language Models), may contribute to this high detection accuracy, we show that deeper word representations like word2vec can capture subtle semantic variances. Furthermore, readability, bias, moral, and affect comparisons reveal a discernible contrast between machine-generated and human generated content. There are variations in expression styles and potentially underlying biases in the data sources (human and machine-generated). This study provides valuable insights into the advancing capacities and challenges associated with machine-generated content across various domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Transformer-based language models have shown strong performance on many Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) tasks. Masked Language Models (MLMs) attract sustained interest because they can be adaptedto different languages and sub-domains through training or fine-tuning on specific corpora while remaining lighterthan modern Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, several MLMs have been released for the biomedicaldomain in French, and experiments suggest that they outperform standard French counterparts. However, nosystematic evaluation comparing all models on the same corpora is available. Objective: This paper presentsan evaluation of masked language models for biomedical French on the task of clinical named entity recognition.Material and methods: We evaluate biomedical models CamemBERT-bio and DrBERT and compare them tostandard French models CamemBERT, FlauBERT and FrALBERT as well as multilingual mBERT using three publicallyavailable corpora for clinical named entity recognition in French. The evaluation set-up relies on gold-standardcorpora as released by the corpus developers. Results: Results suggest that CamemBERT-bio outperformsDrBERT consistently while FlauBERT offers competitive performance and FrAlBERT achieves the lowest carbonfootprint. Conclusion: This is the first benchmark evaluation of biomedical masked language models for Frenchclinical entity recognition that compares model performance consistently on nested entity recognition using metricscovering performance and environmental impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intent classification and slot-filling are essential tasks of Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). In most SLUsystems, those tasks are realized by independent modules. For about fifteen years, models achieving both of themjointly and exploiting their mutual enhancement have been proposed. A multilingual module using a joint modelwas envisioned to create a touristic dialogue system for a European project, HumanE-AI-Net. A combination ofmultiple datasets, including the MEDIA dataset, was suggested for training this joint model. The MEDIA SLU datasetis a French dataset distributed since 2005 by ELRA, mainly used by the French research community and free foracademic research since 2020. Unfortunately, it is annotated only in slots but not intents. An enhanced version ofMEDIA annotated with intents has been built to extend its use to more tasks and use cases. This paper presents thesemi-automatic methodology used to obtain this enhanced version. In addition, we present the first results of SLUexperiments on this enhanced dataset using joint models for intent classification and slot-filling.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Satellite State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Space Domain Awareness (SDA) community routinely tracks satellites in orbit by fitting an orbital state to observations made by the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). In order to fit such orbits, an accurate model of the forces that are acting on the satellite is required. Over the past several decades, high-quality, physics-based models have been developed for satellite state estimation and propagation. These models are exceedingly good at estimating and propagating orbital states for non-maneuvering satellites; however, there are several classes of anomalous accelerations that a satellite might experience which are not well-modeled, such as satellites that use low-thrust electric propulsion to modify their orbit. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a valuable tool for these classes of satellites as they combine physics models with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are highly expressive and versatile function approximators. By combining a physics model with a DNN, the machine learning model need not learn astrodynamics, which results in more efficient and effective utilization of machine learning resources. This paper details the application of PINNs to estimate the orbital state and a continuous, low-amplitude anomalous acceleration profile for satellites. The PINN is trained to learn the unknown acceleration by minimizing the mean square error of observations. We evaluate the performance of pure physics models with PINNs in terms of their observation residuals and their propagation accuracy beyond the fit span of the observations. For a two-day simulation of a GEO satellite using an unmodeled acceleration profile on the order of $10^{-8} \text{ km/s}^2$, the PINN outperformed the best-fit physics model by orders of magnitude for both observation residuals (123 arcsec vs 1.00 arcsec) as well as propagation accuracy (3860 km vs 164 km after five days).</description>

      <title>Natural Language, AI, and Quantum Computing in 2024: Research Ingredients and Directions in QNLP</title>

Abstract: Language processing is at the heart of current developments in artificial intelligence, and quantum computers are becoming available at the same time. This has led to great interest in quantum natural language processing, and several early proposals and experiments. This paper surveys the state of this area, showing how NLP-related techniques including word embeddings, sequential models, attention, and grammatical parsing have been used in quantum language processing. We introduce a new quantum design for the basic task of text encoding (representing a string of characters in memory), which has not been addressed in detail before.
  As well as motivating new technologies, quantum theory has made key contributions to the challenging questions of 'What is uncertainty?' and 'What is intelligence?' As these questions are taking on fresh urgency with artificial systems, the paper also considers some of the ways facts are conceptualized and presented in language. In particular, we argue that the problem of 'hallucinations' arises through a basic misunderstanding: language expresses any number of plausible hypotheses, only a few of which become actual, a distinction that is ignored in classical mechanics, but present (albeit confusing) in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Deep Learning for Intention Estimation of Teleoperation Manipulation in Assembly Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In human-robot collaboration, shared control presents an opportunity to teleoperate robotic manipulation to improve the efficiency of manufacturing and assembly processes. Robots are expected to assist in executing the user's intentions. To this end, robust and prompt intention estimation is needed, relying on behavioral observations. The framework presents an intention estimation technique at hierarchical levels i.e., low-level actions and high-level tasks, by incorporating multi-scale hierarchical information in neural networks. Technically, we employ hierarchical dependency loss to boost overall accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a multi-window method that assigns proper hierarchical prediction windows of input data. An analysis of the predictive power with various inputs demonstrates the predominance of the deep hierarchical model in the sense of prediction accuracy and early intention identification. We implement the algorithm on a virtual reality (VR) setup to teleoperate robotic hands in a simulation with various assembly tasks to show the effectiveness of online estimation.</description>

      <title>MAPL: Model Agnostic Peer-to-peer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective collaboration among heterogeneous clients in a decentralized setting is a rather unexplored avenue in the literature. To structurally address this, we introduce Model Agnostic Peer-to-peer Learning (coined as MAPL) a novel approach to simultaneously learn heterogeneous personalized models as well as a collaboration graph through peer-to-peer communication among neighboring clients. MAPL is comprised of two main modules: (i) local-level Personalized Model Learning (PML), leveraging a combination of intra- and inter-client contrastive losses; (ii) network-wide decentralized Collaborative Graph Learning (CGL) dynamically refining collaboration weights in a privacy-preserving manner based on local task similarities. Our extensive experimentation demonstrates the efficacy of MAPL and its competitive (or, in most cases, superior) performance compared to its centralized model-agnostic counterparts, without relying on any central server. Our code is available and can be accessed here: https://github.com/SayakMukherjee/MAPL</description>

      <title>Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-varying Signal Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</description>

      <title>Developing Healthcare Language Model Embedding Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle on out-of-domain datasets like healthcare focused text. We explore specialized pre-training to adapt smaller LLMs to different healthcare datasets. Three methods are assessed: traditional masked language modeling, Deep Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Textual Representations (DeCLUTR), and a novel pre-training objective utilizing metadata categories from the healthcare settings. These schemes are evaluated on downstream document classification tasks for each dataset, with additional analysis of the resultant embedding spaces. Contrastively trained models outperform other approaches on the classification tasks, delivering strong performance from limited labeled data and with fewer model parameter updates required. While metadata-based pre-training does not further improve classifications across the datasets, it yields interesting embedding cluster separability. All domain adapted LLMs outperform their publicly available general base LLM, validating the importance of domain-specialization. This research illustrates efficient approaches to instill healthcare competency in compact LLMs even under tight computational budgets, an essential capability for responsible and sustainable deployment in local healthcare settings. We provide pre-training guidelines for specialized healthcare LLMs, motivate continued inquiry into contrastive objectives, and demonstrates adaptation techniques to align small LLMs with privacy-sensitive medical tasks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Explanatory Capabilities of Machine Learning Models in Medical Diagnostics: A Human-in-the-Loop Approach</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the evaluation of explanatory capabilities of machine learning models, with a focus on Decision Trees, Random Forest and XGBoost models using a pancreatic cancer dataset. We use Human-in-the-Loop related techniques and medical guidelines as a source of domain knowledge to establish the importance of the different features that are relevant to establish a pancreatic cancer treatment. These features are not only used as a dimensionality reduction approach for the machine learning models, but also as way to evaluate the explainability capabilities of the different models using agnostic and non-agnostic explainability techniques. To facilitate interpretation of explanatory results, we propose the use of similarity measures such as the Weighted Jaccard Similarity coefficient. The goal is to not only select the best performing model but also the one that can best explain its conclusions and aligns with human domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Multi-Modal Pre-Training for Automatic Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated that multi-modal pre-training can improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance compared to randomly initialized models, even when models are fine-tuned on uni-modal tasks. Existing multi-modal pre-training methods for the ASR task have primarily focused on single-stage pre-training where a single unsupervised task is used for pre-training followed by fine-tuning on the downstream task. In this work, we introduce a novel method combining multi-modal and multi-task unsupervised pre-training with a translation-based supervised mid-training approach. We empirically demonstrate that such a multi-stage approach leads to relative word error rate (WER) improvements of up to 38.45% over baselines on both Librispeech and SUPERB. Additionally, we share several important findings for choosing pre-training methods and datasets.</description>

      <title>ChatTracer: Large Language Model Powered Real-time Bluetooth Device Tracking System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard, have transformed the way we interact with cyber technologies. In this paper, we study the possibility of connecting LLM with wireless sensor networks (WSN). A successful design will not only extend LLM's knowledge landscape to the physical world but also revolutionize human interaction with WSN. To the end, we present ChatTracer, an LLM-powered real-time Bluetooth device tracking system. ChatTracer comprises three key components: an array of Bluetooth sniffing nodes, a database, and a fine-tuned LLM. ChatTracer was designed based on our experimental observation that commercial Apple/Android devices always broadcast hundreds of BLE packets per minute even in their idle status. Its novelties lie in two aspects: i) a reliable and efficient BLE packet grouping algorithm; and ii) an LLM fine-tuning strategy that combines both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We have built a prototype of ChatTracer with four sniffing nodes. Experimental results show that ChatTracer not only outperforms existing localization approaches, but also provides an intelligent interface for user interaction.</description>

      <title>Concept-based Analysis of Neural Networks via Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal analysis of vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) is highly desirable but it is very challenging due to the difficulty of expressing formal specifications for vision tasks and the lack of efficient verification procedures. In this paper, we propose to leverage emerging multimodal, vision-language, foundation models (VLMs) as a lens through which we can reason about vision models. VLMs have been trained on a large body of images accompanied by their textual description, and are thus implicitly aware of high-level, human-understandable concepts describing the images. We describe a logical specification language $\texttt{Con}_{\texttt{spec}}$ designed to facilitate writing specifications in terms of these concepts. To define and formally check $\texttt{Con}_{\texttt{spec}}$ specifications, we leverage a VLM, which provides a means to encode and efficiently check natural-language properties of vision models. We demonstrate our techniques on a ResNet-based classifier trained on the RIVAL-10 dataset leveraging CLIP as the multimodal model.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frame, Lightweight &amp; Efficient Vision-Language Models for Question Answering in Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-Modal Language models (MMLMs) have become prominent in autonomous driving research, as these models can provide interpretable textual reasoning and responses for end-to-end autonomous driving safety tasks using traffic scene images and other data modalities. However, current approaches to these systems use expensive large language model (LLM) backbones and image encoders, making such systems unsuitable for real-time autonomous driving systems where tight memory constraints exist and fast inference time is necessary. To address these previous issues, we develop EM-VLM4AD, an efficient, lightweight, multi-frame vision language model which performs Visual Question Answering for autonomous driving. In comparison to previous approaches, EM-VLM4AD requires at least 10 times less memory and floating point operations, while also achieving higher BLEU-4, METEOR, CIDEr, and ROGUE scores than the existing baseline on the DriveLM dataset. EM-VLM4AD also exhibits the ability to extract relevant information from traffic views related to prompts and can answer questions for various autonomous driving subtasks. We release our code to train and evaluate our model at https://github.com/akshaygopalkr/EM-VLM4AD.</description>

      <title>The New Agronomists: Language Models are Experts in Crop Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crop management plays a crucial role in determining crop yield, economic profitability, and environmental sustainability. Despite the availability of management guidelines, optimizing these practices remains a complex and multifaceted challenge. In response, previous studies have explored using reinforcement learning with crop simulators, typically employing simple neural-network-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Building on this foundation, this paper introduces a more advanced intelligent crop management system. This system uniquely combines RL, a language model (LM), and crop simulations facilitated by the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). We utilize deep RL, specifically a deep Q-network, to train management policies that process numerous state variables from the simulator as observations. A novel aspect of our approach is the conversion of these state variables into more informative language, facilitating the language model's capacity to understand states and explore optimal management practices. The empirical results reveal that the LM exhibits superior learning capabilities. Through simulation experiments with maize crops in Florida (US) and Zaragoza (Spain), the LM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under various evaluation metrics but also demonstrates a remarkable improvement of over 49\% in economic profit, coupled with reduced environmental impact when compared to baseline methods.

      <title>Is Synthetic Image Useful for Transfer Learning? An Investigation into Data Generation, Volume, and Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic image data generation represents a promising avenue for training deep learning models, particularly in the realm of transfer learning, where obtaining real images within a specific domain can be prohibitively expensive due to privacy and intellectual property considerations. This work delves into the generation and utilization of synthetic images derived from text-to-image generative models in facilitating transfer learning paradigms. Despite the high visual fidelity of the generated images, we observe that their naive incorporation into existing real-image datasets does not consistently enhance model performance due to the inherent distribution gap between synthetic and real images. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage framework called bridged transfer, which initially employs synthetic images for fine-tuning a pre-trained model to improve its transferability and subsequently uses real data for rapid adaptation. Alongside, We propose dataset style inversion strategy to improve the stylistic alignment between synthetic and real images. Our proposed methods are evaluated across 10 different datasets and 5 distinct models, demonstrating consistent improvements, with up to 30% accuracy increase on classification tasks. Intriguingly, we note that the enhancements were not yet saturated, indicating that the benefits may further increase with an expanded volume of synthetic data.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we provide data stream algorithms that compute optimal splits in decision tree learning. In particular, given a data stream of observations $x_i$ and their labels $y_i$, the goal is to find the optimal split point $j$ that divides the data into two sets such that the mean squared error (for regression) or misclassification rate (for classification) is minimized. We provide various fast streaming algorithms that use sublinear space and a small number of passes for these problems. These algorithms can also be extended to the massively parallel computation model. Our work, while not directly comparable, complements the seminal work of Domingos and Hulten (KDD 2000).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retraining machine learning models remains an important task for real-world machine learning model deployment. Existing methods focus largely on greedy approaches to find the best-performing model without considering the stability of trained model structures across different retraining evolutions. In this study, we develop a mixed integer optimization algorithm that holistically considers the problem of retraining machine learning models across different data batch updates. Our method focuses on retaining consistent analytical insights - which is important to model interpretability, ease of implementation, and fostering trust with users - by using custom-defined distance metrics that can be directly incorporated into the optimization problem. Importantly, our method shows stronger stability than greedily trained models with a small, controllable sacrifice in model performance in a real-world production case study. Finally, important analytical insights, as demonstrated using SHAP feature importance, are shown to be consistent across retraining iterations.</description>

      <title>MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.</description>

      <title>Towards a Robust Retrieval-Based Summarization System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes an investigation of the robustness of large language models (LLMs) for retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based summarization tasks. While LLMs provide summarization capabilities, their performance in complex, real-world scenarios remains under-explored. Our first contribution is LogicSumm, an innovative evaluation framework incorporating realistic scenarios to assess LLM robustness during RAG-based summarization. Based on limitations identified by LogiSumm, we then developed SummRAG, a comprehensive system to create training dialogues and fine-tune a model to enhance robustness within LogicSumm's scenarios. SummRAG is an example of our goal of defining structured methods to test the capabilities of an LLM, rather than addressing issues in a one-off fashion. Experimental results confirm the power of SummRAG, showcasing improved logical coherence and summarization quality. Data, corresponding model weights, and Python code are available online.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) stands as the leading cause of blindness globally, particularly affecting individuals between the ages of 20 and 70. This paper presents a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system designed for the automatic classification of retinal images into five distinct classes: Normal, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR). The proposed system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) employing pre-trained deep learning models. Through the application of fine-tuning techniques, our model is trained on fundus images of diabetic retinopathy with resolutions of 350x350x3 and 224x224x3. Experimental results obtained on the Kaggle platform, utilizing resources comprising 4 CPUs, 17 GB RAM, and 1 GB Disk, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The achieved Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for CNN, MobileNet, VGG-16, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2 models are 0.50, 0.70, 0.53, 0.63, and 0.69, respectively.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Known: Novel Class Discovery for Open-world Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Node classification on graphs is of great importance in many applications. Due to the limited labeling capability and evolution in real-world open scenarios, novel classes can emerge on unlabeled testing nodes. However, little attention has been paid to novel class discovery on graphs. Discovering novel classes is challenging as novel and known class nodes are correlated by edges, which makes their representations indistinguishable when applying message passing GNNs. Furthermore, the novel classes lack labeling information to guide the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel method Open-world gRAph neuraL network (ORAL) to tackle these challenges. ORAL first detects correlations between classes through semi-supervised prototypical learning. Inter-class correlations are subsequently eliminated by the prototypical attention network, leading to distinctive representations for different classes. Furthermore, to fully explore multi-scale graph features for alleviating label deficiencies, ORAL generates pseudo-labels by aligning and ensembling label estimations from multiple stacked prototypical attention networks. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>MANGO: A Benchmark for Evaluating Mapping and Navigation Abilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have recently achieved astonishing performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose MANGO, a benchmark to evaluate their capabilities to perform text-based mapping and navigation. Our benchmark includes 53 mazes taken from a suite of textgames: each maze is paired with a walkthrough that visits every location but does not cover all possible paths. The task is question-answering: for each maze, a large language model reads the walkthrough and answers hundreds of mapping and navigation questions such as "How should you go to Attic from West of House?" and "Where are we if we go north and east from Cellar?". Although these questions are easy to humans, it turns out that even GPT-4, the best-to-date language model, performs poorly at answering them. Further, our experiments suggest that a strong mapping and navigation ability would benefit large language models in performing relevant downstream tasks, such as playing textgames. Our MANGO benchmark will facilitate future research on methods that improve the mapping and navigation capabilities of language models. We host our leaderboard, data, code, and evaluation program at https://mango.ttic.edu and https://github.com/oaklight/mango/.</description>

      <title>CtRL-Sim: Reactive and Controllable Driving Agents with Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating autonomous vehicle stacks (AVs) in simulation typically involves replaying driving logs from real-world recorded traffic. However, agents replayed from offline data do not react to the actions of the AV, and their behaviour cannot be easily controlled to simulate counterfactual scenarios. Existing approaches have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing methods that rely on heuristics or learned generative models of real-world data but these approaches either lack realism or necessitate costly iterative sampling procedures to control the generated behaviours. In this work, we take an alternative approach and propose CtRL-Sim, a method that leverages return-conditioned offline reinforcement learning within a physics-enhanced Nocturne simulator to efficiently generate reactive and controllable traffic agents. Specifically, we process real-world driving data through the Nocturne simulator to generate a diverse offline reinforcement learning dataset, annotated with various reward terms. With this dataset, we train a return-conditioned multi-agent behaviour model that allows for fine-grained manipulation of agent behaviours by modifying the desired returns for the various reward components. This capability enables the generation of a wide range of driving behaviours beyond the scope of the initial dataset, including those representing adversarial behaviours. We demonstrate that CtRL-Sim can efficiently generate diverse and realistic safety-critical scenarios while providing fine-grained control over agent behaviours. Further, we show that fine-tuning our model on simulated safety-critical scenarios generated by our model enhances this controllability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision Transformer, a promising approach that applies Transformer architectures to reinforcement learning, relies on causal self-attention to model sequences of states, actions, and rewards. While this method has shown competitive results, this paper investigates the integration of the Mamba framework, known for its advanced capabilities in efficient and effective sequence modeling, into the Decision Transformer architecture, focusing on the potential performance enhancements in sequential decision-making tasks. Our study systematically evaluates this integration by conducting a series of experiments across various decision-making environments, comparing the modified Decision Transformer, Decision Mamba, with its traditional counterpart. This work contributes to the advancement of sequential decision-making models, suggesting that the architecture and training methodology of neural networks can significantly impact their performance in complex tasks, and highlighting the potential of Mamba as a valuable tool for improving the efficacy of Transformer-based models in reinforcement learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>TDANet: A Novel Temporal Denoise Convolutional Neural Network With Attention for Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault diagnosis plays a crucial role in maintaining the operational integrity of mechanical systems, preventing significant losses due to unexpected failures. As intelligent manufacturing and data-driven approaches evolve, Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a pivotal technique in fault diagnosis research, recognized for its ability to autonomously extract complex features. However, the practical application of current fault diagnosis methods is challenged by the complexity of industrial environments. This paper proposed the Temporal Denoise Convolutional Neural Network With Attention (TDANet), designed to improve fault diagnosis performance in noise environments. This model transforms one-dimensional signals into two-dimensional tensors based on their periodic properties, employing multi-scale 2D convolution kernels to extract signal information both within and across periods. This method enables effective identification of signal characteristics that vary over multiple time scales. The TDANet incorporates a Temporal Variable Denoise (TVD) module with residual connections and a Multi-head Attention Fusion (MAF) module, enhancing the saliency of information within noisy data and maintaining effective fault diagnosis performance. Evaluation on two datasets, CWRU (single sensor) and Real aircraft sensor fault (multiple sensors), demonstrates that the TDANet model significantly outperforms existing deep learning approaches in terms of diagnostic accuracy under noisy environments.</description>

      <title>A Peg-in-hole Task Strategy for Holes in Concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method that enables an industrial robot to accomplish the peg-in-hole task for holes in concrete is proposed. The proposed method involves slightly detaching the peg from the wall, when moving between search positions, to avoid the negative influence of the concrete's high friction coefficient. It uses a deep neural network (DNN), trained via reinforcement learning, to effectively find holes with variable shape and surface finish (due to the brittle nature of concrete) without analytical modeling or control parameter tuning. The method uses displacement of the peg toward the wall surface, in addition to force and torque, as one of the inputs of the DNN. Since the displacement increases as the peg gets closer to the hole (due to the chamfered shape of holes in concrete), it is a useful parameter for inputting in the DNN. The proposed method was evaluated by training the DNN on a hole 500 times and attempting to find 12 unknown holes. The results of the evaluation show the DNN enabled a robot to find the unknown holes with average success rate of 96.1% and average execution time of 12.5 seconds. Additional evaluations with random initial positions and a different type of peg demonstrate the trained DNN can generalize well to different conditions. Analyses of the influence of the peg displacement input showed the success rate of the DNN is increased by utilizing this parameter. These results validate the proposed method in terms of its effectiveness and applicability to the construction industry.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the General Agent Capabilities of Low-Parameter LLMs through Tuning and Multi-Branch Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-source pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong language understanding and generation capabilities, making them highly successful in a variety of tasks. However, when used as agents for dealing with complex problems in the real world, their performance is far inferior to large commercial models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. As intelligent agents, LLMs need to have the capabilities of task planning, long-term memory, and the ability to leverage external tools to achieve satisfactory performance. Various methods have been proposed to enhance the agent capabilities of LLMs. On the one hand, methods involve constructing agent-specific data and fine-tuning the models. On the other hand, some methods focus on designing prompts that effectively activate the reasoning abilities of the LLMs. We explore both strategies on the 7B and 13B models. We propose a comprehensive method for constructing agent-specific data using GPT-4. Through supervised fine-tuning with constructed data, we find that for these models with a relatively small number of parameters, supervised fine-tuning can significantly reduce hallucination outputs and formatting errors in agent tasks. Furthermore, techniques such as multi-path reasoning and task decomposition can effectively decrease problem complexity and enhance the performance of LLMs as agents. We evaluate our method on five agent tasks of AgentBench and achieve satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>Semantically-Shifted Incremental Adapter-Tuning is A Continual ViTransformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes while overcoming catastrophic forgetting. The introduction of pre-trained models has brought new tuning paradigms to CIL. In this paper, we revisit different parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods within the context of continual learning. We observe that adapter tuning demonstrates superiority over prompt-based methods, even without parameter expansion in each learning session. Motivated by this, we propose incrementally tuning the shared adapter without imposing parameter update constraints, enhancing the learning capacity of the backbone. Additionally, we employ feature sampling from stored prototypes to retrain a unified classifier, further improving its performance. We estimate the semantic shift of old prototypes without access to past samples and update stored prototypes session by session. Our proposed method eliminates model expansion and avoids retaining any image samples. It surpasses previous pre-trained model-based CIL methods and demonstrates remarkable continual learning capabilities. Experimental results on five CIL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</description>

Abstract: Data augmentation is one of the regularization strategies for the training of deep learning models, which enhances generalizability and prevents overfitting, leading to performance improvement. Although researchers have proposed various data augmentation techniques, they often lack consideration for the difficulty of augmented data. Recently, another line of research suggests incorporating the concept of curriculum learning with data augmentation in the field of natural language processing. In this study, we adopt curriculum data augmentation for image data augmentation and propose colorful cutout, which gradually increases the noise and difficulty introduced in the augmented image. Our experimental results highlight the possibility of curriculum data augmentation for image data. We publicly released our source code to improve the reproducibility of our study.</description>

      <title>PURPLE: Making a Large Language Model a Better SQL Writer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) techniques play an increasingly important role in Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) translation. LLMs trained by extensive corpora have strong natural language understanding and basic SQL generation abilities without additional tuning specific to NL2SQL tasks. Existing LLMs-based NL2SQL approaches try to improve the translation by enhancing the LLMs with an emphasis on user intention understanding. However, LLMs sometimes fail to generate appropriate SQL due to their lack of knowledge in organizing complex logical operator composition. A promising method is to input the LLMs with demonstrations, which include known NL2SQL translations from various databases. LLMs can learn to organize operator compositions from the input demonstrations for the given task. In this paper, we propose PURPLE (Pre-trained models Utilized to Retrieve Prompts for Logical Enhancement), which improves accuracy by retrieving demonstrations containing the requisite logical operator composition for the NL2SQL task on hand, thereby guiding LLMs to produce better SQL translation. PURPLE achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of 80.5% exact-set match accuracy and 87.8% execution match accuracy on the validation set of the popular NL2SQL benchmark Spider. PURPLE maintains high accuracy across diverse benchmarks, budgetary constraints, and various LLMs, showing robustness and cost-effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: In the field of text data augmentation, rule-based methods are widely adopted for real-world applications owing to their cost-efficiency. However, conventional rule-based approaches suffer from the possibility of losing the original semantics of the given text. We propose a novel text data augmentation strategy that avoids such phenomena through a straightforward deletion of adverbs, which play a subsidiary role in the sentence. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach for not just single text classification, but also natural language inference that requires semantic preservation.

      <title>Revolutionizing Disease Diagnosis with simultaneous functional PET/MR and Deeply Integrated Brain Metabolic, Hemodynamic, and Perfusion Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous functional PET/MR (sf-PET/MR) presents a cutting-edge multimodal neuroimaging technique. It provides an unprecedented opportunity for concurrently monitoring and integrating multifaceted brain networks built by spatiotemporally covaried metabolic activity, neural activity, and cerebral blood flow (perfusion). Albeit high scientific/clinical values, short in hardware accessibility of PET/MR hinders its applications, let alone modern AI-based PET/MR fusion models. Our objective is to develop a clinically feasible AI-based disease diagnosis model trained on comprehensive sf-PET/MR data with the power of, during inferencing, allowing single modality input (e.g., PET only) as well as enforcing multimodal-based accuracy. To this end, we propose MX-ARM, a multimodal MiXture-of-experts Alignment and Reconstruction Model. It is modality detachable and exchangeable, allocating different multi-layer perceptrons dynamically ("mixture of experts") through learnable weights to learn respective representations from different modalities. Such design will not sacrifice model performance in uni-modal situation. To fully exploit the inherent complex and nonlinear relation among modalities while producing fine-grained representations for uni-modal inference, we subsequently add a modal alignment module to line up a dominant modality (e.g., PET) with representations of auxiliary modalities (MR). We further adopt multimodal reconstruction to promote the quality of learned features. Experiments on precious multimodal sf-PET/MR data for Mild Cognitive Impairment diagnosis showcase the efficacy of our model toward clinically feasible precision medicine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing techniques for discovering molecular structures with desired properties is crucial in artificial intelligence(AI)-based drug discovery. Combining deep generative models with reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective strategy for generating molecules with specific properties. Despite its potential, this approach is ineffective in exploring the vast chemical space and optimizing particular chemical properties. To overcome these limitations, we present Mol-AIR, a reinforcement learning-based framework using adaptive intrinsic rewards for effective goal-directed molecular generation. Mol-AIR leverages the strengths of both history-based and learning-based intrinsic rewards by exploiting random distillation network and counting-based strategies. In benchmark tests, Mol-AIR demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches in generating molecules with desired properties without any prior knowledge, including penalized LogP, QED, and celecoxib similarity. We believe that Mol-AIR represents a significant advancement in drug discovery, offering a more efficient path to discovering novel therapeutics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series are generated in diverse domains such as economic, traffic, health, and energy, where forecasting of future values has numerous important applications. Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The benchmark code and data are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB.</description>

      <title>CAESAR: Enhancing Federated RL in Heterogeneous MDPs through Convergence-Aware Sampling with Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we delve into Federated Reinforcement Learning (FedRL) in the context of value-based agents operating across diverse Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Existing FedRL methods typically aggregate agents' learning by averaging the value functions across them to improve their performance. However, this aggregation strategy is suboptimal in heterogeneous environments where agents converge to diverse optimal value functions. To address this problem, we introduce the Convergence-AwarE SAmpling with scReening (CAESAR) aggregation scheme designed to enhance the learning of individual agents across varied MDPs. CAESAR is an aggregation strategy used by the server that combines convergence-aware sampling with a screening mechanism. By exploiting the fact that agents learning in identical MDPs are converging to the same optimal value function, CAESAR enables the selective assimilation of knowledge from more proficient counterparts, thereby significantly enhancing the overall learning efficiency. We empirically validate our hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of CAESAR in enhancing the learning efficiency of agents, using both a custom-built GridWorld environment and the classical FrozenLake-v1 task, each presenting varying levels of environmental heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT v.s. Media Bias: A Comparative Study of GPT-3.5 and Fine-tuned Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our rapidly evolving digital sphere, the ability to discern media bias becomes crucial as it can shape public sentiment and influence pivotal decisions. The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, noted for their broad utility in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, invites exploration of their efficacy in media bias detection. Can ChatGPT detect media bias? This study seeks to answer this question by leveraging the Media Bias Identification Benchmark (MBIB) to assess ChatGPT's competency in distinguishing six categories of media bias, juxtaposed against fine-tuned models such as BART, ConvBERT, and GPT-2. The findings present a dichotomy: ChatGPT performs at par with fine-tuned models in detecting hate speech and text-level context bias, yet faces difficulties with subtler elements of other bias detections, namely, fake news, racial, gender, and cognitive biases.</description>

      <title>HARMamba: Efficient Wearable Sensor Human Activity Recognition Based on Bidirectional Selective SSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable sensor human activity recognition (HAR) is a crucial area of research in activity sensing. While transformer-based temporal deep learning models have been extensively studied and implemented, their large number of parameters present significant challenges in terms of system computing load and memory usage, rendering them unsuitable for real-time mobile activity recognition applications. Recently, an efficient hardware-aware state space model (SSM) called Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative. Mamba demonstrates strong potential in long sequence modeling, boasts a simpler network architecture, and offers an efficient hardware-aware design. Leveraging SSM for activity recognition represents an appealing avenue for exploration. In this study, we introduce HARMamba, which employs a more lightweight selective SSM as the foundational model architecture for activity recognition. The goal is to address the computational resource constraints encountered in real-time activity recognition scenarios. Our approach involves processing sensor data flow by independently learning each channel and segmenting the data into "patches". The marked sensor sequence's position embedding serves as the input token for the bidirectional state space model, ultimately leading to activity categorization through the classification head. Compared to established activity recognition frameworks like Transformer-based models, HARMamba achieves superior performance while also reducing computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, our proposed method has been extensively tested on four public activity datasets: PAMAP2, WISDM, UNIMIB, and UCI, demonstrating impressive performance in activity recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Swarm Learning for Edge Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the widespread deployment of smart IoT devices at wireless edge for collaborative machine learning tasks, ushering in a new era of edge learning. With a huge number of hardware-constrained IoT devices operating in resource-limited wireless networks, edge learning encounters substantial challenges, including communication and computation bottlenecks, device and data heterogeneity, security risks, privacy leakages, non-convex optimization, and complex wireless environments. To address these issues, this article explores a novel framework known as distributed swarm learning (DSL), which combines artificial intelligence and biological swarm intelligence in a holistic manner. By harnessing advanced signal processing and communications, DSL provides efficient solutions and robust tools for large-scale IoT at the edge of wireless networks.</description>

Abstract: Space Communication poses challenges such as severe delays, hard-to-predict routes and communication disruptions. The Delay Tolerant Network architecture, having been specifically designed keeping such scenarios in mind, is suitable to address some challenges. The traditional DTN routing protocols fall short of delivering optimal performance, due to the inherent complexities of space communication. Researchers have aimed at using recent advancements in AI to mitigate some routing challenges [9]. We propose utilising a feedforward neural network to develop a novel protocol NeuraLunaDTNet, which enhances the efficiency of the PRoPHET routing protocol for lunar communication, by learning contact plans in dynamically changing spatio-temporal graph.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models for Predictive Tabular Tasks in Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of data science, the predictive tasks of classification, regression, and imputation of missing values are commonly encountered challenges associated with tabular data. This research endeavors to apply Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing these predictive tasks. Despite their proficiency in comprehending natural language, LLMs fall short in dealing with structured tabular data. This limitation stems from their lacking exposure to the intricacies of tabular data during their foundational training. Our research aims to mitigate this gap by compiling a comprehensive corpus of tables annotated with instructions and executing large-scale training of Llama-2 on this enriched dataset. Furthermore, we investigate the practical application of applying the trained model to zero-shot prediction, few-shot prediction, and in-context learning scenarios. Through extensive experiments, our methodology has shown significant improvements over existing benchmarks. These advancements highlight the efficacy of tailoring LLM training to solve table-related problems in data science, thereby establishing a new benchmark in the utilization of LLMs for enhancing tabular intelligence.</description>

      <title>Distributed agency in second language learning and teaching through generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI offers significant opportunities for language learning. Tools like ChatGPT can provide informal second language practice through chats in written or voice forms, with the learner specifying through prompts conversational parameters such as proficiency level, language register, and discussion topics. AI can be instructed to give corrective feedback, create practice exercises, or develop an extended study plan. Instructors can use AI to build learning and assessment materials in a variety of media. AI is likely to make immersive technologies more powerful and versatile, moving away from scripted interactions. For both learners and teachers, it is important to understand the limitations of AI systems that arise from their purely statistical model of human language, which limits their ability to deal with nuanced social and cultural aspects of language use. Additionally, there are ethical concerns over how AI systems are created as well as practical constraints in their use, especially for less privileged populations. The power and versatility of AI tools are likely to turn them into valuable and constant companions in many peoples lives (akin to smartphones), creating a close connection that goes beyond simple tool use. Ecological theories such as sociomaterialism are helpful in examining the shared agency that develops through close user-AI interactions, as are the perspectives on human-object relations from Indigenous cultures.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Aggregation-diffusion with Metastability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous graph neural models based on differential equations have expanded the architecture of graph neural networks (GNNs). Due to the connection between graph diffusion and message passing, diffusion-based models have been widely studied. However, diffusion naturally drives the system towards an equilibrium state, leading to issues like over-smoothing. To this end, we propose GRADE inspired by graph aggregation-diffusion equations, which includes the delicate balance between nonlinear diffusion and aggregation induced by interaction potentials. The node representations obtained through aggregation-diffusion equations exhibit metastability, indicating that features can aggregate into multiple clusters. In addition, the dynamics within these clusters can persist for long time periods, offering the potential to alleviate over-smoothing effects. This nonlinear diffusion in our model generalizes existing diffusion-based models and establishes a connection with classical GNNs. We prove that GRADE achieves competitive performance across various benchmarks and alleviates the over-smoothing issue in GNNs evidenced by the enhanced Dirichlet energy.</description>

      <title>Optimal Policy Learning with Observational Data in Multi-Action Scenarios: Estimation, Risk Preference, and Potential Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with optimal policy learning (OPL) with observational data, i.e. data-driven optimal decision-making, in multi-action (or multi-arm) settings, where a finite set of decision options is available. It is organized in three parts, where I discuss respectively: estimation, risk preference, and potential failures. The first part provides a brief review of the key approaches to estimating the reward (or value) function and optimal policy within this context of analysis. Here, I delineate the identification assumptions and statistical properties related to offline optimal policy learning estimators. In the second part, I delve into the analysis of decision risk. This analysis reveals that the optimal choice can be influenced by the decision maker's attitude towards risks, specifically in terms of the trade-off between reward conditional mean and conditional variance. Here, I present an application of the proposed model to real data, illustrating that the average regret of a policy with multi-valued treatment is contingent on the decision-maker's attitude towards risk. The third part of the paper discusses the limitations of optimal data-driven decision-making by highlighting conditions under which decision-making can falter. This aspect is linked to the failure of the two fundamental assumptions essential for identifying the optimal choice: (i) overlapping, and (ii) unconfoundedness. Some conclusions end the paper.</description>

      <title>Using LLMs to Model the Beliefs and Preferences of Targeted Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of aligning a large language model (LLM) to model the preferences of a human population. Modeling the beliefs, preferences, and behaviors of a specific population can be useful for a variety of different applications, such as conducting simulated focus groups for new products, conducting virtual surveys, and testing behavioral interventions, especially for interventions that are expensive, impractical, or unethical. Existing work has had mixed success using LLMs to accurately model human behavior in different contexts. We benchmark and evaluate two well-known fine-tuning approaches and evaluate the resulting populations on their ability to match the preferences of real human respondents on a survey of preferences for battery electric vehicles (BEVs). We evaluate our models against their ability to match population-wide statistics as well as their ability to match individual responses, and we investigate the role of temperature in controlling the trade-offs between these two. Additionally, we propose and evaluate a novel loss term to improve model performance on responses that require a numeric response.</description>

      <title>FABind+: Enhancing Molecular Docking through Improved Pocket Prediction and Pose Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a pivotal process in drug discovery. While traditional techniques rely on extensive sampling and simulation governed by physical principles, these methods are often slow and costly. The advent of deep learning-based approaches has shown significant promise, offering increases in both accuracy and efficiency. Building upon the foundational work of FABind, a model designed with a focus on speed and accuracy, we present FABind+, an enhanced iteration that largely boosts the performance of its predecessor. We identify pocket prediction as a critical bottleneck in molecular docking and propose a novel methodology that significantly refines pocket prediction, thereby streamlining the docking process. Furthermore, we introduce modifications to the docking module to enhance its pose generation capabilities. In an effort to bridge the gap with conventional sampling/generative methods, we incorporate a simple yet effective sampling technique coupled with a confidence model, requiring only minor adjustments to the regression framework of FABind. Experimental results and analysis reveal that FABind+ remarkably outperforms the original FABind, achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance, and delivers insightful modeling strategies. This demonstrates FABind+ represents a substantial step forward in molecular docking and drug discovery. Our code is in https://github.com/QizhiPei/FABind.</description>

      <title>ELITR-Bench: A Meeting Assistant Benchmark for Long-Context Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently witnessed an increasing interest in extending models' context size to better capture dependencies within long documents. While benchmarks have been proposed to assess long-range abilities, existing efforts primarily considered generic tasks that are not necessarily aligned with real-world applications. In contrast, our work proposes a new benchmark for long-context LLMs focused on a practical meeting assistant scenario. In this scenario, the long contexts consist of transcripts obtained by automatic speech recognition, presenting unique challenges for LLMs due to the inherent noisiness and oral nature of such data. Our benchmark, named ELITR-Bench, augments the existing ELITR corpus' transcripts with 271 manually crafted questions and their ground-truth answers. Our experiments with recent long-context LLMs on ELITR-Bench highlight a gap between open-source and proprietary models, especially when questions are asked sequentially within a conversation. We also provide a thorough analysis of our GPT-4-based evaluation method, encompassing insights from a crowdsourcing study. Our findings suggest that while GPT-4's evaluation scores are correlated with human judges', its ability to differentiate among more than three score levels may be limited.</description>

      <title>Latxa: An Open Language Model and Evaluation Suite for Basque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Latxa, a family of large language models for Basque ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters. Latxa is based on Llama 2, which we continue pretraining on a new Basque corpus comprising 4.3M documents and 4.2B tokens. Addressing the scarcity of high-quality benchmarks for Basque, we further introduce 4 multiple choice evaluation datasets: EusProficiency, comprising 5,169 questions from official language proficiency exams; EusReading, comprising 352 reading comprehension questions; EusTrivia, comprising 1,715 trivia questions from 5 knowledge areas; and EusExams, comprising 16,774 questions from public examinations. In our extensive evaluation, Latxa outperforms all previous open models we compare to by a large margin. In addition, it is competitive with GPT-4 Turbo in language proficiency and understanding, despite lagging behind in reading comprehension and knowledge-intensive tasks. Both the Latxa family of models, as well as our new pretraining corpora and evaluation datasets, are publicly available under open licenses at https://github.com/hitz-zentroa/latxa. Our suite enables reproducible research on methods to build LLMs for low-resource languages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of masked multimodal transformer architectures to learn a robust embedding space when modality samples are sparsely aligned is studied by measuring the quality of generated embedding spaces as a function of modal sparsity. An extension to the masked multimodal transformer model is proposed which incorporates modal-incomplete channels in the multihead attention mechanism called modal channel attention (MCA). Two datasets with 4 modalities are used, CMU-MOSEI for multimodal sentiment recognition and TCGA for multiomics. Models are shown to learn uniform and aligned embedding spaces with only two out of four modalities in most samples. It was found that, even with no modal sparsity, the proposed MCA mechanism improves the quality of generated embedding spaces, recall metrics, and subsequent performance on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Correct Physicians, Yet? Investigating Effective Interaction Methods in the Medical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist and potentially correct physicians in medical decision-making tasks. We evaluate several LLMs, including Meditron, Llama2, and Mistral, to analyze the ability of these models to interact effectively with physicians across different scenarios. We consider questions from PubMedQA and several tasks, ranging from binary (yes/no) responses to long answer generation, where the answer of the model is produced after an interaction with a physician. Our findings suggest that prompt design significantly influences the downstream accuracy of LLMs and that LLMs can provide valuable feedback to physicians, challenging incorrect diagnoses and contributing to more accurate decision-making. For example, when the physician is accurate 38% of the time, Mistral can produce the correct answer, improving accuracy up to 74% depending on the prompt being used, while Llama2 and Meditron models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt choice. Our analysis also uncovers the challenges of ensuring that LLM-generated suggestions are pertinent and useful, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Improving Learnt Local MAPF Policies with Heuristic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding collision-free paths for a team of agents to reach their goal locations. State-of-the-art classical MAPF solvers typically employ heuristic search to find solutions for hundreds of agents but are typically centralized and can struggle to scale when run with short timeouts. Machine learning (ML) approaches that learn policies for each agent are appealing as these could enable decentralized systems and scale well while maintaining good solution quality. Current ML approaches to MAPF have proposed methods that have started to scratch the surface of this potential. However, state-of-the-art ML approaches produce "local" policies that only plan for a single timestep and have poor success rates and scalability. Our main idea is that we can improve a ML local policy by using heuristic search methods on the output probability distribution to resolve deadlocks and enable full horizon planning. We show several model-agnostic ways to use heuristic search with learnt policies that significantly improve the policies' success rates and scalability. To our best knowledge, we demonstrate the first time ML-based MAPF approaches have scaled to high congestion scenarios (e.g. 20% agent density).</description>

      <title>ChainNet: Structured Metaphor and Metonymy in WordNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The senses of a word exhibit rich internal structure. In a typical lexicon, this structure is overlooked: a word's senses are encoded as a list without inter-sense relations. We present ChainNet, a lexical resource which for the first time explicitly identifies these structures. ChainNet expresses how senses in the Open English Wordnet are derived from one another: every nominal sense of a word is either connected to another sense by metaphor or metonymy, or is disconnected in the case of homonymy. Because WordNet senses are linked to resources which capture information about their meaning, ChainNet represents the first dataset of grounded metaphor and metonymy.</description>

      <title>SeaBird: Segmentation in Bird's View with Dice Loss Improves Monocular 3D Detection of Large Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monocular 3D detectors achieve remarkable performance on cars and smaller objects. However, their performance drops on larger objects, leading to fatal accidents. Some attribute the failures to training data scarcity or their receptive field requirements of large objects. In this paper, we highlight this understudied problem of generalization to large objects. We find that modern frontal detectors struggle to generalize to large objects even on nearly balanced datasets. We argue that the cause of failure is the sensitivity of depth regression losses to noise of larger objects. To bridge this gap, we comprehensively investigate regression and dice losses, examining their robustness under varying error levels and object sizes. We mathematically prove that the dice loss leads to superior noise-robustness and model convergence for large objects compared to regression losses for a simplified case. Leveraging our theoretical insights, we propose SeaBird (Segmentation in Bird's View) as the first step towards generalizing to large objects. SeaBird effectively integrates BEV segmentation on foreground objects for 3D detection, with the segmentation head trained with the dice loss. SeaBird achieves SoTA results on the KITTI-360 leaderboard and improves existing detectors on the nuScenes leaderboard, particularly for large objects.

      <title>MTLoRA: A Low-Rank Adaptation Approach for Efficient Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting models pre-trained on large-scale datasets to a variety of downstream tasks is a common strategy in deep learning. Consequently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising way to adapt pre-trained models to different tasks while training only a minimal number of parameters. While most of these methods are designed for single-task adaptation, parameter-efficient training in Multi-Task Learning (MTL) architectures is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce MTLoRA, a novel framework for parameter-efficient training of MTL models. MTLoRA employs Task-Agnostic and Task-Specific Low-Rank Adaptation modules, which effectively disentangle the parameter space in MTL fine-tuning, thereby enabling the model to adeptly handle both task specialization and interaction within MTL contexts. We applied MTLoRA to hierarchical-transformer-based MTL architectures, adapting them to multiple downstream dense prediction tasks. Our extensive experiments on the PASCAL dataset show that MTLoRA achieves higher accuracy on downstream tasks compared to fully fine-tuning the MTL model while reducing the number of trainable parameters by 3.6x. Furthermore, MTLoRA establishes a Pareto-optimal trade-off between the number of trainable parameters and the accuracy of the downstream tasks, outperforming current state-of-the-art parameter-efficient training methods in both accuracy and efficiency. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Gecko: Versatile Text Embeddings Distilled from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Gecko, a compact and versatile text embedding model. Gecko achieves strong retrieval performance by leveraging a key idea: distilling knowledge from large language models (LLMs) into a retriever. Our two-step distillation process begins with generating diverse, synthetic paired data using an LLM. Next, we further refine the data quality by retrieving a set of candidate passages for each query, and relabeling the positive and hard negative passages using the same LLM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the compactness of the Gecko. On the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), Gecko with 256 embedding dimensions outperforms all existing entries with 768 embedding size. Gecko with 768 embedding dimensions achieves an average score of 66.31, competing with 7x larger models and 5x higher dimensional embeddings.</description>

      <title>ReALM: Reference Resolution As Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reference resolution is an important problem, one that is essential to understand and successfully handle context of different kinds. This context includes both previous turns and context that pertains to non-conversational entities, such as entities on the user's screen or those running in the background. While LLMs have been shown to be extremely powerful for a variety of tasks, their use in reference resolution, particularly for non-conversational entities, remains underutilized. This paper demonstrates how LLMs can be used to create an extremely effective system to resolve references of various types, by showing how reference resolution can be converted into a language modeling problem, despite involving forms of entities like those on screen that are not traditionally conducive to being reduced to a text-only modality. We demonstrate large improvements over an existing system with similar functionality across different types of references, with our smallest model obtaining absolute gains of over 5% for on-screen references. We also benchmark against GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with our smallest model achieving performance comparable to that of GPT-4, and our larger models substantially outperforming it.</description>

      <title>Unsolvable Problem Detection: Evaluating Trustworthiness of Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel and significant challenge for Vision Language Models (VLMs), termed Unsolvable Problem Detection (UPD). UPD examines the VLM's ability to withhold answers when faced with unsolvable problems in the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. UPD encompasses three distinct settings: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD). To deeply investigate the UPD problem, extensive experiments indicate that most VLMs, including GPT-4V and LLaVA-Next-34B, struggle with our benchmarks to varying extents, highlighting significant room for the improvements. To address UPD, we explore both training-free and training-based solutions, offering new insights into their effectiveness and limitations. We hope our insights, together with future efforts within the proposed UPD settings, will enhance the broader understanding and development of more practical and reliable VLMs.</description>

      <title>QAGCN: Answering Multi-Relation Questions via Single-Step Implicit Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-relation question answering (QA) is a challenging task, where given questions usually require long reasoning chains in KGs that consist of multiple relations. Recently, methods with explicit multi-step reasoning over KGs have been prominently used in this task and have demonstrated promising performance. Examples include methods that perform stepwise label propagation through KG triples and methods that navigate over KG triples based on reinforcement learning. A main weakness of these methods is that their reasoning mechanisms are usually complex and difficult to implement or train. In this paper, we argue that multi-relation QA can be achieved via end-to-end single-step implicit reasoning, which is simpler, more efficient, and easier to adopt. We propose QAGCN -- a Question-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based method that includes a novel GCN architecture with controlled question-dependent message propagation for the implicit reasoning. Extensive experiments have been conducted, where QAGCN achieved competitive and even superior performance compared to state-of-the-art explicit-reasoning methods. Our code and pre-trained models are available in the repository: https://github.com/ruijie-wang-uzh/QAGCN</description>

      <title>Gradient strikes back: How filtering out high frequencies improves explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attribution methods correspond to a class of explainability methods (XAI) that aim to assess how individual inputs contribute to a model's decision-making process. We have identified a significant limitation in one type of attribution methods, known as "white-box" methods. Although highly efficient, these methods rely on a gradient signal that is often contaminated by high-frequency noise. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new approach called "FORGrad". This simple method effectively filters out noise artifacts by using optimal cut-off frequencies tailored to the unique characteristics of each model architecture. Our findings show that FORGrad consistently enhances the performance of already existing white-box methods, enabling them to compete effectively with more accurate yet computationally demanding "black-box" methods. We anticipate that our research will foster broader adoption of simpler and more efficient white-box methods for explainability, offering a better balance between faithfulness and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Relational Bottleneck as an Inductive Bias for Efficient Abstraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central challenge for cognitive science is to explain how abstract concepts are acquired from limited experience. This has often been framed in terms of a dichotomy between connectionist and symbolic cognitive models. Here, we highlight a recently emerging line of work that suggests a novel reconciliation of these approaches, by exploiting an inductive bias that we term the relational bottleneck. In that approach, neural networks are constrained via their architecture to focus on relations between perceptual inputs, rather than the attributes of individual inputs. We review a family of models that employ this approach to induce abstractions in a data-efficient manner, emphasizing their potential as candidate models for the acquisition of abstract concepts in the human mind and brain.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with an external Thinker module to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents. Unlike augmenting LLMs with prompt engineering, Thinker directly harnesses knowledge from databases and employs various optimization techniques. The framework forms a reasoning hierarchy where LLMs handle intuitive System-1 tasks such as natural language processing, while the Thinker focuses on cognitive System-2 tasks that require complex logical analysis and domain-specific knowledge. Our framework is presented using a 9-player Werewolf game that demands dual-system reasoning. We introduce a communication protocol between LLMs and the Thinker, and train the Thinker using data from 18800 human sessions and reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in deductive reasoning, speech generation, and online game evaluation. Additionally, we fine-tune a 6B LLM to surpass GPT4 when integrated with the Thinker. This paper also contributes the largest dataset for social deduction games to date.</description>

      <title>WoLF: Wide-scope Large Language Model Framework for CXR Understanding</title>

Abstract: Significant methodological strides have been made toward Chest X-ray (CXR) understanding via modern vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrating impressive Visual Question Answering (VQA) and CXR report generation abilities. However, existing CXR understanding frameworks still possess several procedural caveats. (1) Previous methods solely use CXR reports, which are insufficient for comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially when additional health-related data like medication history and prior diagnoses are needed. (2) Previous methods use raw CXR reports, which are often arbitrarily structured. While modern language models can understand various text formats, restructuring reports for clearer, organized anatomy-based information could enhance their usefulness. (3) Current evaluation methods for CXR-VQA primarily emphasize linguistic correctness, lacking the capability to offer nuanced assessments of the generated answers. In this work, to address the aforementioned caveats, we introduce WoLF, a Wide-scope Large Language Model Framework for CXR understanding. To resolve (1), we capture multi-faceted records of patients, which are utilized for accurate diagnoses in real-world clinical scenarios. Specifically, we adopt the Electronic Health Records (EHR) to generate instruction-following data suited for CXR understanding. Regarding (2), we enhance report generation performance by decoupling knowledge in CXR reports based on anatomical structure even within the attention step via masked attention. To address (3), we introduce an AI-evaluation protocol optimized for assessing the capabilities of LLM. Through extensive experimental validations, WoLF demonstrates superior performance over other models on MIMIC-CXR in the AI-evaluation arena about VQA (up to +9.47%p mean score) and by metrics about report generation (+7.3%p BLEU-1).</description>

      <title>Learning To Guide Human Decision Makers With Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in developing AIs for assisting human decision-making in high-stakes tasks, such as medical diagnosis, for the purpose of improving decision quality and reducing cognitive strain. Mainstream approaches team up an expert with a machine learning model to which safer decisions are offloaded, thus letting the former focus on cases that demand their attention. his separation of responsibilities setup, however, is inadequate for high-stakes scenarios. On the one hand, the expert may end up over-relying on the machine's decisions due to anchoring bias, thus losing the human oversight that is increasingly being required by regulatory agencies to ensure trustworthy AI. On the other hand, the expert is left entirely unassisted on the (typically hardest) decisions on which the model abstained. As a remedy, we introduce learning to guide (LTG), an alternative framework in which - rather than taking control from the human expert - the machine provides guidance useful for decision making, and the human is entirely responsible for coming up with a decision. In order to ensure guidance is interpretable} and task-specific, we develop SLOG, an approach for turning any vision-language model into a capable generator of textual guidance by leveraging a modicum of human feedback. Our empirical evaluation highlights the promise of \method on a challenging, real-world medical diagnosis task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a setting in which $N$ agents aim to speedup a common Stochastic Approximation (SA) problem by acting in parallel and communicating with a central server. We assume that the up-link transmissions to the server are subject to asynchronous and potentially unbounded time-varying delays. To mitigate the effect of delays and stragglers while reaping the benefits of distributed computation, we propose \texttt{DASA}, a Delay-Adaptive algorithm for multi-agent Stochastic Approximation. We provide a finite-time analysis of \texttt{DASA} assuming that the agents' stochastic observation processes are independent Markov chains. Significantly advancing existing results, \texttt{DASA} is the first algorithm whose convergence rate depends only on the mixing time $\tau_{mix}$ and on the average delay $\tau_{avg}$ while jointly achieving an $N$-fold convergence speedup under Markovian sampling. Our work is relevant for various SA applications, including multi-agent and distributed temporal difference (TD) learning, Q-learning and stochastic optimization with correlated data.</description>

Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled data followed by supervised fine-tuning on labeled data is a popular paradigm for learning from limited labeled examples. We extend this paradigm to the classical positive unlabeled (PU) setting, where the task is to learn a binary classifier given only a few labeled positive samples, and (often) a large amount of unlabeled samples (which could be positive or negative).
  We first propose a simple extension of standard infoNCE family of contrastive losses, to the PU setting; and show that this learns superior representations, as compared to existing unsupervised and supervised approaches. We then develop a simple methodology to pseudo-label the unlabeled samples using a new PU-specific clustering scheme; these pseudo-labels can then be used to train the final (positive vs. negative) classifier. Our method handily outperforms state-of-the-art PU methods over several standard PU benchmark datasets, while not requiring a-priori knowledge of any class prior (which is a common assumption in other PU methods). We also provide a simple theoretical analysis that motivates our methods.</description>

Abstract: In meta reinforcement learning (meta RL), an agent learns from a set of training tasks how to quickly solve a new task, drawn from the same task distribution. The optimal meta RL policy, a.k.a. the Bayes-optimal behavior, is well defined, and guarantees optimal reward in expectation, taken with respect to the task distribution. The question we explore in this work is how many training tasks are required to guarantee approximately optimal behavior with high probability. Recent work provided the first such PAC analysis for a model-free setting, where a history-dependent policy was learned from the training tasks. In this work, we propose a different approach: directly learn the task distribution, using density estimation techniques, and then train a policy on the learned task distribution. We show that our approach leads to bounds that depend on the dimension of the task distribution. In particular, in settings where the task distribution lies in a low-dimensional manifold, we extend our analysis to use dimensionality reduction techniques and account for such structure, obtaining significantly better bounds than previous work, which strictly depend on the number of states and actions. The key of our approach is the regularization implied by the kernel density estimation method. We further demonstrate that this regularization is useful in practice, when `plugged in' the state-of-the-art VariBAD meta RL algorithm.</description>

      <title>GOTCHA: Real-Time Video Deepfake Detection via Challenge-Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of AI-enabled Real-Time Deepfakes (RTDFs), the integrity of online video interactions has become a growing concern. RTDFs have now made it feasible to replace an imposter's face with their victim in live video interactions. Such advancement in deepfakes also coaxes detection to rise to the same standard. However, existing deepfake detection techniques are asynchronous and hence ill-suited for RTDFs. To bridge this gap, we propose a challenge-response approach that establishes authenticity in live settings. We focus on talking-head style video interaction and present a taxonomy of challenges that specifically target inherent limitations of RTDF generation pipelines. We evaluate representative examples from the taxonomy by collecting a unique dataset comprising eight challenges, which consistently and visibly degrades the quality of state-of-the-art deepfake generators. These results are corroborated both by humans and a new automated scoring function, leading to 88.6% and 80.1% AUC, respectively. The findings underscore the promising potential of challenge-response systems for explainable and scalable real-time deepfake detection in practical scenarios.

      <title>Restricting to the chip architecture maintains the quantum neural network accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) stand as a prominent strategy for constructing quantum machine learning models. These models comprise both a quantum and a classical component. The quantum facet is characterized by a parametrization $U$, typically derived from the composition of various quantum gates. On the other hand, the classical component involves an optimizer that adjusts the parameters of $U$ to minimize a cost function $C$. Despite the extensive applications of VQAs, several critical questions persist, such as determining the optimal gate sequence, devising efficient parameter optimization strategies, selecting appropriate cost functions, and understanding the influence of quantum chip architectures on the final results. This article aims to address the last question, emphasizing that, in general, the cost function tends to converge towards an average value as the utilized parameterization approaches a $2$-design. Consequently, when the parameterization closely aligns with a $2$-design, the quantum neural network model's outcome becomes less dependent on the specific parametrization. This insight leads to the possibility of leveraging the inherent architecture of quantum chips to define the parametrization for VQAs. By doing so, the need for additional swap gates is mitigated, consequently reducing the depth of VQAs and minimizing associated errors.</description>

      <title>Attending to Graph Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, transformer architectures for graphs emerged as an alternative to established techniques for machine learning with graphs, such as (message-passing) graph neural networks. So far, they have shown promising empirical results, e.g., on molecular prediction datasets, often attributed to their ability to circumvent graph neural networks' shortcomings, such as over-smoothing and over-squashing. Here, we derive a taxonomy of graph transformer architectures, bringing some order to this emerging field. We overview their theoretical properties, survey structural and positional encodings, and discuss extensions for important graph classes, e.g., 3D molecular graphs. Empirically, we probe how well graph transformers can recover various graph properties, how well they can deal with heterophilic graphs, and to what extent they prevent over-squashing. Further, we outline open challenges and research direction to stimulate future work. Our code is available at https://github.com/luis-mueller/probing-graph-transformers.</description>

Abstract: Data augmentations are known to improve robustness in speech-processing tasks. In this study, we summarize and compare different data augmentation strategies using S3PRL toolkit. We explore how HuBERT and wav2vec perform using different augmentation techniques (SpecAugment, Gaussian Noise, Speed Perturbation) for Phoneme Recognition (PR) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. We evaluate model performance in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) and word error rate (WER). From the experiments, we observed that SpecAugment slightly improves the performance of HuBERT and wav2vec on the original dataset. Also, we show that models trained using the Gaussian Noise and Speed Perturbation dataset are more robust when tested with augmented test sets.</description>

      <title>Making Batch Normalization Great in Federated Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06530v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) is widely used in {centralized} deep learning to improve convergence and generalization. However, in {federated} learning (FL) with decentralized data, prior work has observed that training with BN could hinder performance and suggested replacing it with Group Normalization (GN). In this paper, we revisit this substitution by expanding the empirical study conducted in prior work. Surprisingly, we find that BN outperforms GN in many FL settings. The exceptions are high-frequency communication and extreme non-IID regimes. We reinvestigate factors that are believed to cause this problem, including the mismatch of BN statistics across clients and the deviation of gradients during local training. We empirically identify a simple practice that could reduce the impacts of these factors while maintaining the strength of BN. Our approach, which we named FIXBN, is fairly easy to implement, without any additional training or communication costs, and performs favorably across a wide range of FL settings. We hope that our study could serve as a valuable reference for future practical usage and theoretical analysis in FL.</description>

      <title>VGTS: Visually Guided Text Spotting for Novel Categories in Historical Manuscripts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00746v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of historical manuscript research, scholars frequently encounter novel symbols in ancient texts, investing considerable effort in their identification and documentation. Although existing object detection methods achieve impressive performance on known categories, they struggle to recognize novel symbols without retraining. To address this limitation, we propose a Visually Guided Text Spotting (VGTS) approach that accurately spots novel characters using just one annotated support sample. The core of VGTS is a spatial alignment module consisting of a Dual Spatial Attention (DSA) block and a Geometric Matching (GM) block. The DSA block aims to identify, focus on, and learn discriminative spatial regions in the support and query images, mimicking the human visual spotting process. It first refines the support image by analyzing inter-channel relationships to identify critical areas, and then refines the query image by focusing on informative key points. The GM block, on the other hand, establishes the spatial correspondence between the two images, enabling accurate localization of the target character in the query image. To tackle the example imbalance problem in low-resource spotting tasks, we develop a novel torus loss function that enhances the discriminative power of the embedding space for distance metric learning. To further validate our approach, we introduce a new dataset featuring ancient Dongba hieroglyphics (DBH) associated with the Naxi minority of China. Extensive experiments on the DBH dataset and other public datasets, including EGY, VML-HD, TKH, and NC, show that VGTS consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. The proposed framework exhibits great potential for application in historical manuscript text spotting, enabling scholars to efficiently identify and document novel symbols with minimal annotation effort.</description>

      <title>Safe Explicable Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human expectations arise from their understanding of others and the world. In the context of human-AI interaction, this understanding may not align with reality, leading to the AI agent failing to meet expectations and compromising team performance. Explicable planning, introduced as a method to bridge this gap, aims to reconcile human expectations with the agent's optimal behavior, facilitating interpretable decision-making. However, an unresolved critical issue is ensuring safety in explicable planning, as it could result in explicable behaviors that are unsafe. To address this, we propose Safe Explicable Planning (SEP), which extends the prior work to support the specification of a safety bound. The goal of SEP is to find behaviors that align with human expectations while adhering to the specified safety criterion. Our approach generalizes the consideration of multiple objectives stemming from multiple models rather than a single model, yielding a Pareto set of safe explicable policies. We present both an exact method, guaranteeing finding the Pareto set, and a more efficient greedy method that finds one of the policies in the Pareto set. Additionally, we offer approximate solutions based on state aggregation to improve scalability. We provide formal proofs that validate the desired theoretical properties of these methods. Evaluation through simulations and physical robot experiments confirms the effectiveness of our approach for safe explicable planning.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient and Surrogate-Based Design Optimization of Underwater Vehicle Hulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics simulations like computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are a computational bottleneck in computer-aided design (CAD) optimization processes. To overcome this bottleneck, one requires either an optimization framework that is highly sample-efficient, or a fast data-driven proxy (surrogate model) for long-running simulations. Both approaches have benefits and limitations. Bayesian optimization is often used for sample efficiency, but it solves one specific problem and struggles with transferability; alternatively, surrogate models can offer fast and often more generalizable solutions for CFD problems, but gathering data for and training such models can be computationally demanding. In this work, we leverage recent advances in optimization and artificial intelligence (AI) to explore both of these potential approaches, in the context of designing an optimal unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) hull. Our study finds that the Bayesian Optimization-Lower Condition Bound (BO-LCB) algorithm is the most sample-efficient optimization framework and has the best convergence behavior of those considered. Subsequently, we show that our DNN-based surrogate model predicts drag force on test data in tight agreement with CFD simulations, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.85%. Combining these results, we demonstrate a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup (with comparable accuracy) for the design optimization process when the surrogate model is used. To our knowledge, this is the first study applying Bayesian optimization and DNN-based surrogate modeling to the problem of UUV design optimization, and we share our developments as open-source software.</description>

      <title>Reasoning or Reciting? Exploring the Capabilities and Limitations of Language Models Through Counterfactual Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impressive performance of recent language models across a wide range of tasks suggests that they possess a degree of abstract reasoning skills. Are these skills general and transferable, or specialized to specific tasks seen during pretraining? To disentangle these effects, we propose an evaluation framework based on "counterfactual" task variants that deviate from the default assumptions underlying standard tasks. Across a suite of 11 tasks, we observe nontrivial performance on the counterfactual variants, but nevertheless find that performance substantially and consistently degrades compared to the default conditions. This suggests that while current LMs may possess abstract task-solving skills to an extent, they often also rely on narrow, non-transferable procedures for task-solving. These results motivate a more careful interpretation of language model performance that teases apart these aspects of behavior.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Deep Multi-Label ON/OFF Classification of Low Frequency Metered Home Appliances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is the process of obtaining appliance-level data from a single metering point, measuring total electricity consumption of a household or a business. Appliance-level data can be directly used for demand response applications and energy management systems as well as for awareness raising and motivation for improvements in energy efficiency. Recently, classical machine learning and deep learning (DL) techniques became very popular and proved as highly effective for NILM classification, but with the growing complexity these methods are faced with significant computational and energy demands during both their training and operation. In this paper, we introduce a novel DL model aimed at enhanced multi-label classification of NILM with improved computation and energy efficiency. We also propose an evaluation methodology for comparison of different models using data synthesized from the measurement datasets so as to better represent real-world scenarios. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed model has its energy consumption reduced by more than 23% while providing on average approximately 8 percentage points in performance improvement when evaluating on data derived from REFIT and UK-DALE datasets. We also show a 12 percentage point performance advantage of the proposed DL based model over a random forest model and observe performance degradation with the increase of the number of devices in the household, namely with each additional 5 devices, the average performance degrades by approximately 7 percentage points.</description>

Abstract: Differentiable optimization has received a significant amount of attention due to its foundational role in the domain of machine learning based on neural networks. This paper proposes a differentiable layer, named Differentiable Frank-Wolfe Layer (DFWLayer), by rolling out the Frank-Wolfe method, a well-known optimization algorithm which can solve constrained optimization problems without projections and Hessian matrix computations, thus leading to an efficient way of dealing with large-scale convex optimization problems with norm constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the DFWLayer not only attains competitive accuracy in solutions and gradients but also consistently adheres to constraints.</description>

      <title>A multiobjective continuation method to compute the regularization path of deep neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12044v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparsity is a highly desired feature in deep neural networks (DNNs) since it ensures numerical efficiency, improves the interpretability of models (due to the smaller number of relevant features), and robustness. For linear models, it is well known that there exists a \emph{regularization path} connecting the sparsest solution in terms of the $\ell^1$ norm, i.e., zero weights and the non-regularized solution. Very recently, there was a first attempt to extend the concept of regularization paths to DNNs by means of treating the empirical loss and sparsity ($\ell^1$ norm) as two conflicting criteria and solving the resulting multiobjective optimization problem for low-dimensional DNN. However, due to the non-smoothness of the $\ell^1$ norm and the high number of parameters, this approach is not very efficient from a computational perspective for high-dimensional DNNs. To overcome this limitation, we present an algorithm that allows for the approximation of the entire Pareto front for the above-mentioned objectives in a very efficient manner for high-dimensional DNNs with millions of parameters. We present numerical examples using both deterministic and stochastic gradients. We furthermore demonstrate that knowledge of the regularization path allows for a well-generalizing network parametrization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to compute the regularization path for non-convex multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) with millions of degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis is the process of determining the set of reactant molecules that can react to form a desired product. Semi-template-based retrosynthesis methods, which imitate the reverse logic of synthesis reactions, first predict the reaction centers in the products, and then complete the resulting synthons back into reactants. We develop a new offline-online reinforcement learning method RLSynC for synthon completion in semi-template-based methods. RLSynC assigns one agent to each synthon, all of which complete the synthons by conducting actions step by step in a synchronized fashion. RLSynC learns the policy from both offline training episodes and online interactions, which allows RLSynC to explore new reaction spaces. RLSynC uses a standalone forward synthesis model to evaluate the likelihood of the predicted reactants in synthesizing a product, and thus guides the action search. Our results demonstrate that RLSynC can outperform state-of-the-art synthon completion methods with improvements as high as 14.9%, highlighting its potential in synthesis planning.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Aware Continual Test-Time Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since autonomous driving systems usually face dynamic and ever-changing environments, continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) has been proposed as a strategy for transferring deployed models to continually changing target domains. However, the pursuit of long-term adaptation often introduces catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation problems, which impede the practical implementation of CTTA in the real world. Recently, existing CTTA methods mainly focus on utilizing a majority of parameters to fit target domain knowledge through self-training. Unfortunately, these approaches often amplify the challenge of error accumulation due to noisy pseudo-labels, and pose practical limitations stemming from the heavy computational costs associated with entire model updates. In this paper, we propose a distribution-aware tuning (DAT) method to make the semantic segmentation CTTA efficient and practical in real-world applications. DAT adaptively selects and updates two small groups of trainable parameters based on data distribution during the continual adaptation process, including domain-specific parameters (DSP) and task-relevant parameters (TRP). Specifically, DSP exhibits sensitivity to outputs with substantial distribution shifts, effectively mitigating the problem of error accumulation. In contrast, TRP are allocated to positions that are responsive to outputs with minor distribution shifts, which are fine-tuned to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem. In addition, since CTTA is a temporal task, we introduce the Parameter Accumulation Update (PAU) strategy to collect the updated DSP and TRP in target domain sequences. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used semantic segmentation CTTA benchmarks, achieving promising performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: Renal biopsies are the gold standard for diagnosis of kidney diseases. Lesion scores made by renal pathologists are semi-quantitative and exhibit high inter-observer variability. Automating lesion classification within segmented anatomical structures can provide decision support in quantification analysis and reduce the inter-observer variability. Nevertheless, classifying lesions in regions-of-interest (ROIs) is clinically challenging due to (a) a large amount of densely packed anatomical objects (up to 1000), (b) class imbalance across different compartments (at least 3), (c) significant variation in object scales (i.e. sizes and shapes), and (d) the presence of multi-label lesions per anatomical structure. Existing models lack the capacity to address these complexities efficiently and generically. This paper presents \textbf{a generalized technical solution} for large-scale, multi-source datasets with diverse lesions. Our approach utilizes two sub-networks: dense instance segmentation and lesion classification. We introduce \textbf{DiffRegFormer}, an end-to-end dense instance segmentation model designed for multi-class, multi-scale objects within ROIs. Combining diffusion models, transformers, and RCNNs, DiffRegFormer efficiently recognizes over 500 objects across three anatomical classes (glomeruli, tubuli, arteries) within ROIs on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. On a dataset of 303 ROIs (from 148 Jones' silver-stained renal WSIs), it outperforms state of art models, achieving AP of 52.1\% (detection) and 46.8\% (segmentation). Our lesion classification sub-network achieves 89.2\% precision and 64.6\% recall on 21889 object patches (from the 303 ROIs). Importantly, the model demonstrates direct domain transfer to PAS-stained WSIs without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Naming Practices of Pre-Trained Models in Hugging Face</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01642</link>

Abstract: As innovation in deep learning continues, many engineers seek to adopt Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) as components in computer systems. Researchers publish PTMs, which engineers adapt for quality or performance prior to deployment. PTM authors should choose appropriate names for their PTMs, which would facilitate model discovery and reuse. However, prior research has reported that model names are not always well chosen - and are sometimes erroneous. The naming for PTM packages has not been systematically studied.
  In this paper, we frame and conduct the first empirical investigation of PTM naming practices in the Hugging Face PTM registry. We initiated our study with a survey of 108 Hugging Face users to understand the practices in PTM naming. From our survey analysis, we highlight discrepancies from traditional software package naming, and present findings on naming practices. Our findings indicate there is a great mismatch between engineers' preferences and practical practices of PTM naming. We also present practices on detecting naming anomalies and introduce a novel automated DNN ARchitecture Assessment technique (DARA), capable of detecting PTM naming anomalies. We envision future works on leveraging meta-features of PTMs to improve model reuse and trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>Language Model Beats Diffusion -- Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are the dominant models for generative tasks in language, they do not perform as well as diffusion models on image and video generation. To effectively use LLMs for visual generation, one crucial component is the visual tokenizer that maps pixel-space inputs to discrete tokens appropriate for LLM learning. In this paper, we introduce MAGVIT-v2, a video tokenizer designed to generate concise and expressive tokens for both videos and images using a common token vocabulary. Equipped with this new tokenizer, we show that LLMs outperform diffusion models on standard image and video generation benchmarks including ImageNet and Kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that our tokenizer surpasses the previously top-performing video tokenizer on two more tasks: (1) video compression comparable to the next-generation video codec (VCC) according to human evaluations, and (2) learning effective representations for action recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Self-Conditioned Flow Matching for Multi-Ligand Docking and Binding Site Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant amount of protein function requires binding small molecules, including enzymatic catalysis. As such, designing binding pockets for small molecules has several impactful applications ranging from drug synthesis to energy storage. Towards this goal, we first develop HarmonicFlow, an improved generative process over 3D protein-ligand binding structures based on our self-conditioned flow matching objective. FlowSite extends this flow model to jointly generate a protein pocket's discrete residue types and the molecule's binding 3D structure. We show that HarmonicFlow improves upon state-of-the-art generative processes for docking in simplicity, generality, and average sample quality in pocket-level docking. Enabled by this structure modeling, FlowSite designs binding sites substantially better than baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Interpreting CLIP's Image Representation via Text-Based Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05916v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the CLIP image encoder by analyzing how individual model components affect the final representation. We decompose the image representation as a sum across individual image patches, model layers, and attention heads, and use CLIP's text representation to interpret the summands. Interpreting the attention heads, we characterize each head's role by automatically finding text representations that span its output space, which reveals property-specific roles for many heads (e.g. location or shape). Next, interpreting the image patches, we uncover an emergent spatial localization within CLIP. Finally, we use this understanding to remove spurious features from CLIP and to create a strong zero-shot image segmenter. Our results indicate that a scalable understanding of transformer models is attainable and can be used to repair and improve models.</description>

      <title>GTA: A Geometry-Aware Attention Mechanism for Multi-View Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As transformers are equivariant to the permutation of input tokens, encoding the positional information of tokens is necessary for many tasks. However, since existing positional encoding schemes have been initially designed for NLP tasks, their suitability for vision tasks, which typically exhibit different structural properties in their data, is questionable. We argue that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs. By evaluating on multiple novel view synthesis (NVS) datasets in the sparse wide-baseline multi-view setting, we show that our attention, called Geometric Transform Attention (GTA), improves learning efficiency and performance of state-of-the-art transformer-based NVS models without any additional learned parameters and only minor computational overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the exponential growth in large language models (LLMs), leveraging their emergent properties for specialized domains like finance merits exploration. However, regulated fields such as finance pose unique constraints, requiring domain-optimized frameworks. We present ConFIRM, an LLM-based conversational financial information retrieval model tailored for query intent classification and knowledge base labeling.
  ConFIRM comprises two modules:
  1) a method to synthesize finance domain-specific question-answer pairs, and
  2) evaluation of parameter efficient fine-tuning approaches for the query classification task. We generate a dataset of over 4000 samples, assessing accuracy on a separate test set.
  ConFIRM achieved over 90% accuracy, essential for regulatory compliance. ConFIRM provides a data-efficient solution to extract precise query intent for financial dialog systems.</description>

      <title>Learning From Mistakes Makes LLM Better Reasoner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20689v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) recently exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities on solving math problems. To further improve their reasoning capabilities, this work explores whether LLMs can LEarn from MistAkes (LEMA), akin to the human learning process. Consider a human student who failed to solve a math problem, he will learn from what mistake he has made and how to correct it. Mimicking this error-driven learning process, LEMA incorporates mistake-correction data pairs during fine-tuning LLMs. Specifically, we first collect inaccurate reasoning paths from various LLMs, and then employ GPT-4 as a ''corrector'' to identify the mistake step, explain the reason for the mistake, correct the mistake and generate the final answer. In addition, we apply a correction-centric evolution strategy that effectively expands the question set for generating correction data. Experiments across various LLMs and reasoning tasks show that LEMA effectively improves CoT-alone fine-tuning. Our further ablations shed light on the non-homogeneous effectiveness between CoT data and correction data. These results suggest a significant potential for LLMs to improve through learning from their mistakes. Our code, models and prompts are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/LEMA.</description>

      <title>DialogBench: Evaluating LLMs as Human-like Dialogue Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in new dialogue capabilities by leveraging instruction tuning, which refreshes human impressions of dialogue systems. The long-standing goal of dialogue systems is to be human-like enough to establish long-term connections with users. Therefore, there has been an urgent need to evaluate LLMs as human-like dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose DialogBench, a dialogue evaluation benchmark that contains 12 dialogue tasks to probe the capabilities of LLMs as human-like dialogue systems should have. Specifically, we prompt GPT-4 to generate evaluation instances for each task. We first design the basic prompt based on widely used design principles and further mitigate the existing biases to generate higher-quality evaluation instances. Our extensive tests on English and Chinese DialogBench of 26 LLMs show that instruction tuning improves the human likeness of LLMs to a certain extent, but most LLMs still have much room for improvement as human-like dialogue systems. Interestingly, results also show that the positioning of assistant AI can make instruction tuning weaken the human emotional perception of LLMs and their mastery of information about human daily life.</description>

      <title>Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of strong visual backbones and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has led to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) becoming the current standard for a wide range of vision and language (VL) tasks. However, recent research has shown that even the most advanced LMMs still struggle to capture aspects of compositional visual reasoning, such as attributes and relationships between objects. One solution is to utilize scene graphs (SGs)--a formalization of objects and their relations and attributes that has been extensively used as a bridge between the visual and textual domains. Yet, scene graph data requires scene graph annotations, which are expensive to collect and thus not easily scalable. Moreover, finetuning an LMM based on SG data can lead to catastrophic forgetting of the pretraining objective. To overcome this, inspired by chain-of-thought methods, we propose Compositional Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a novel zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting method that utilizes SG representations in order to extract compositional knowledge from an LMM. Specifically, we first generate an SG using the LMM, and then use that SG in the prompt to produce a response. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed CCoT approach not only improves LMM performance on several vision and language VL compositional benchmarks but also improves the performance of several popular LMMs on general multimodal benchmarks, without the need for fine-tuning or annotated ground-truth SGs.

      <title>Emergent Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation from Off-the-shelf Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From image-text pairs, large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) learn to implicitly associate image regions with words, which prove effective for tasks like visual question answering. However, leveraging the learned association for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective, training-free technique, Plug-and-Play Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss. To balance between over-segmentation and under-segmentation, we introduce Salience Dropout; by iteratively dropping patches that the model is most attentive to, we are able to better resolve the entire extent of the segmentation mask. \shortname{} does not require any neural network training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations, even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over comparable baselines (+29.4% mIoU on Pascal VOC, +13.2% mIoU on Pascal Context, +14.0% mIoU on MS COCO, and +11.4% mIoU on ADE-20K.) and even outperforms most baselines that conduct additional network training on top of pretrained VLMs. Our codebase is at https://github.com/letitiabanana/PnP-OVSS.</description>

      <title>TransNeXt: Robust Foveal Visual Perception for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the depth degradation effect in residual connections, many efficient Vision Transformers models that rely on stacking layers for information exchange often fail to form sufficient information mixing, leading to unnatural visual perception. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose Aggregated Attention, a biomimetic design-based token mixer that simulates biological foveal vision and continuous eye movement while enabling each token on the feature map to have a global perception. Furthermore, we incorporate learnable tokens that interact with conventional queries and keys, which further diversifies the generation of affinity matrices beyond merely relying on the similarity between queries and keys. Our approach does not rely on stacking for information exchange, thus effectively avoiding depth degradation and achieving natural visual perception. Additionally, we propose Convolutional GLU, a channel mixer that bridges the gap between GLU and SE mechanism, which empowers each token to have channel attention based on its nearest neighbor image features, enhancing local modeling capability and model robustness. We combine aggregated attention and convolutional GLU to create a new visual backbone called TransNeXt. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TransNeXt achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple model sizes. At a resolution of $224^2$, TransNeXt-Tiny attains an ImageNet accuracy of 84.0%, surpassing ConvNeXt-B with 69% fewer parameters. Our TransNeXt-Base achieves an ImageNet accuracy of 86.2% and an ImageNet-A accuracy of 61.6% at a resolution of $384^2$, a COCO object detection mAP of 57.1, and an ADE20K semantic segmentation mIoU of 54.7.</description>

      <title>Learning from One Continuous Video Stream</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for online learning from a single continuous video stream -- the way people and animals learn, without mini-batches, data augmentation or shuffling. This poses great challenges given the high correlation between consecutive video frames and there is very little prior work on it. Our framework allows us to do a first deep dive into the topic and includes a collection of streams and tasks composed from two existing video datasets, plus methodology for performance evaluation that considers both adaptation and generalization. We employ pixel-to-pixel modelling as a practical and flexible way to switch between pre-training and single-stream evaluation as well as between arbitrary tasks, without ever requiring changes to models and always using the same pixel loss. Equipped with this framework we obtained large single-stream learning gains from pre-training with a novel family of future prediction tasks, found that momentum hurts, and that the pace of weight updates matters. The combination of these insights leads to matching the performance of IID learning with batch size 1, when using the same architecture and without costly replay buffers.</description>

      <title>Rapid Motor Adaptation for Robotic Manipulator Arms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing generalizable manipulation skills is a core challenge in embodied AI. This includes generalization across diverse task configurations, encompassing variations in object shape, density, friction coefficient, and external disturbances such as forces applied to the robot. Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA) offers a promising solution to this challenge. It posits that essential hidden variables influencing an agent's task performance, such as object mass and shape, can be effectively inferred from the agent's action and proprioceptive history. Drawing inspiration from RMA in locomotion and in-hand rotation, we use depth perception to develop agents tailored for rapid motor adaptation in a variety of manipulation tasks. We evaluated our agents on four challenging tasks from the Maniskill2 benchmark, namely pick-and-place operations with hundreds of objects from the YCB and EGAD datasets, peg insertion with precise position and orientation, and operating a variety of faucets and handles, with customized environment variations. Empirical results demonstrate that our agents surpass state-of-the-art methods like automatic domain randomization and vision-based policies, obtaining better generalization performance and sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>GlitchBench: Can large multimodal models detect video game glitches?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have evolved from large language models (LLMs) to integrate multiple input modalities, such as visual inputs. This integration augments the capacity of LLMs for tasks requiring visual comprehension and reasoning. However, the extent and limitations of their enhanced abilities are not fully understood, especially when it comes to real-world tasks. To address this gap, we introduce GlitchBench, a novel benchmark derived from video game quality assurance tasks, to test and evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs. Our benchmark is curated from a variety of unusual and glitched scenarios from video games and aims to challenge both the visual and linguistic reasoning powers of LMMs in detecting and interpreting out-of-the-ordinary events. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LMMs, and we show that GlitchBench presents a new challenge for these models. Code and data are available at: https://glitchbench.github.io/</description>

Abstract: The goal of multimodal alignment is to learn a single latent space that is shared between multimodal inputs. The most powerful models in this space have been trained using massive datasets of paired inputs and large-scale computational resources, making them prohibitively expensive to train in many practical scenarios. We surmise that existing unimodal encoders pre-trained on large amounts of unimodal data should provide an effective bootstrap to create multimodal models from unimodal ones at much lower costs. We therefore propose FuseMix, a multimodal augmentation scheme that operates on the latent spaces of arbitrary pre-trained unimodal encoders. Using FuseMix for multimodal alignment, we achieve competitive performance -- and in certain cases outperform state-of-the art methods -- in both image-text and audio-text retrieval, with orders of magnitude less compute and data: for example, we outperform CLIP on the Flickr30K text-to-image retrieval task with $\sim \! 600\times$ fewer GPU days and $\sim \! 80\times$ fewer image-text pairs. Additionally, we show how our method can be applied to convert pre-trained text-to-image generative models into audio-to-image ones.

      <title>Visual Spatial Attention and Proprioceptive Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Robust Peg-in-Hole Task Under Variable Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anchor-bolt insertion is a peg-in-hole task performed in the construction field for holes in concrete. Efforts have been made to automate this task, but the variable lighting and hole surface conditions, as well as the requirements for short setup and task execution time make the automation challenging. In this study, we introduce a vision and proprioceptive data-driven robot control model for this task that is robust to challenging lighting and hole surface conditions. This model consists of a spatial attention point network (SAP) and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy that are trained jointly end-to-end to control the robot. The model is trained in an offline manner, with a sample-efficient framework designed to reduce training time and minimize the reality gap when transferring the model to the physical world. Through evaluations with an industrial robot performing the task in 12 unknown holes, starting from 16 different initial positions, and under three different lighting conditions (two with misleading shadows), we demonstrate that SAP can generate relevant attention points of the image even in challenging lighting conditions. We also show that the proposed model enables task execution with higher success rate and shorter task completion time than various baselines. Due to the proposed model's high effectiveness even in severe lighting, initial positions, and hole conditions, and the offline training framework's high sample-efficiency and short training time, this approach can be easily applied to construction.</description>

      <title>Conversational Question Answering with Reformulations over Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational question answering (convQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) involves answering multi-turn natural language questions about information contained in a KG. State-of-the-art methods of ConvQA often struggle with inexplicit question-answer pairs. These inputs are easy for human beings to understand given a conversation history, but hard for a machine to interpret, which can degrade ConvQA performance. To address this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based model, CornNet, which utilizes question reformulations generated by large language models (LLMs) to improve ConvQA performance. CornNet adopts a teacher-student architecture where a teacher model learns question representations using human writing reformulations, and a student model to mimic the teacher model's output via reformulations generated by LLMs. The learned question representation is then used by an RL model to locate the correct answer in a KG. Extensive experimental results show that CornNet outperforms state-of-the-art convQA models.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Diagnostics for Robustness via Illuminated Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of multi-agent systems, ensuring robustness in unfamiliar and adversarial settings is crucial. Notwithstanding their outstanding performance in familiar environments, these systems often falter in new situations due to overfitting during the training phase. This is especially pronounced in settings where both cooperative and competitive behaviours are present, encapsulating a dual nature of overfitting and generalisation challenges. To address this issue, we present Multi-Agent Diagnostics for Robustness via Illuminated Diversity (MADRID), a novel approach for generating diverse adversarial scenarios that expose strategic vulnerabilities in pre-trained multi-agent policies. Leveraging the concepts from open-ended learning, MADRID navigates the vast space of adversarial settings, employing a target policy's regret to gauge the vulnerabilities of these settings. We evaluate the effectiveness of MADRID on the 11vs11 version of Google Research Football, one of the most complex environments for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, we employ MADRID for generating a diverse array of adversarial settings for TiZero, the state-of-the-art approach which "masters" the game through 45 days of training on a large-scale distributed infrastructure. We expose key shortcomings in TiZero's tactical decision-making, underlining the crucial importance of rigorous evaluation in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>SERNet-Former: Semantic Segmentation by Efficient Residual Network with Attention-Boosting Gates and Attention-Fusion Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15741v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the efficiency of state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation requires overcoming the increasing computational cost as well as issues such as fusing semantic information from global and local contexts. Based on the recent success and problems that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) encounter in semantic segmentation, this research proposes an encoder-decoder architecture with a unique efficient residual network, Efficient-ResNet. Attention-boosting gates (AbGs) and attention-boosting modules (AbMs) are deployed by aiming to fuse the equivariant and feature-based semantic information with the equivalent sizes of the output of global context of the efficient residual network in the encoder. Respectively, the decoder network is developed with the additional attention-fusion networks (AfNs) inspired by AbM. AfNs are designed to improve the efficiency in the one-to-one conversion of the semantic information by deploying additional convolution layers in the decoder part. Our network is tested on the challenging CamVid and Cityscapes datasets, and the proposed methods reveal significant improvements on the residual networks. To the best of our knowledge, the developed network, SERNet-Former, achieves state-of-the-art results (84.62 % mean IoU) on CamVid dataset and challenging results (87.35 % mean IoU) on Cityscapes validation dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce "posterior flows" - generalizations of "probability flows" to a broader class of stochastic processes not necessarily diffusion processes - and propose a systematic training-free method to transform the posterior flow of a "linear" stochastic process characterized by the equation Xt = at * X0 + st * X1 into a straight constant-speed (SC) flow, reminiscent of Rectified Flow. This transformation facilitates fast sampling along the original posterior flow without training a new model of the SC flow. The flexibility of our approach allows us to extend our transformation to inter-convert two posterior flows from distinct "linear" stochastic processes. Moreover, we can easily integrate high-order numerical solvers into the transformed SC flow, further enhancing sampling accuracy and efficiency. Rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results substantiate the advantages of our framework.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Aspect Framework for Counter Narrative Evaluation using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counter narratives - informed responses to hate speech contexts designed to refute hateful claims and de-escalate encounters - have emerged as an effective hate speech intervention strategy. While previous work has proposed automatic counter narrative generation methods to aid manual interventions, the evaluation of these approaches remains underdeveloped. Previous automatic metrics for counter narrative evaluation lack alignment with human judgment as they rely on superficial reference comparisons instead of incorporating key aspects of counter narrative quality as evaluation criteria. To address prior evaluation limitations, we propose a novel evaluation framework prompting LLMs to provide scores and feedback for generated counter narrative candidates using 5 defined aspects derived from guidelines from counter narrative specialized NGOs. We found that LLM evaluators achieve strong alignment to human-annotated scores and feedback and outperform alternative metrics, indicating their potential as multi-aspect, reference-free and interpretable evaluators for counter narrative evaluation.</description>

      <title>MultiCorrupt: A Multi-Modal Robustness Dataset and Benchmark of LiDAR-Camera Fusion for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal 3D object detection models for automated driving have demonstrated exceptional performance on computer vision benchmarks like nuScenes. However, their reliance on densely sampled LiDAR point clouds and meticulously calibrated sensor arrays poses challenges for real-world applications. Issues such as sensor misalignment, miscalibration, and disparate sampling frequencies lead to spatial and temporal misalignment in data from LiDAR and cameras. Additionally, the integrity of LiDAR and camera data is often compromised by adverse environmental conditions such as inclement weather, leading to occlusions and noise interference. To address this challenge, we introduce MultiCorrupt, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of multi-modal 3D object detectors against ten distinct types of corruptions. We evaluate five state-of-the-art multi-modal detectors on MultiCorrupt and analyze their performance in terms of their resistance ability. Our results show that existing methods exhibit varying degrees of robustness depending on the type of corruption and their fusion strategy. We provide insights into which multi-modal design choices make such models robust against certain perturbations. The dataset generation code and benchmark are open-sourced at https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/MultiCorrupt.</description>

      <title>Defending Against Weight-Poisoning Backdoor Attacks for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies for application to language models have been proposed and successfully implemented. However, this raises the question of whether PEFT, which only updates a limited set of model parameters, constitutes security vulnerabilities when confronted with weight-poisoning backdoor attacks. In this study, we show that PEFT is more susceptible to weight-poisoning backdoor attacks compared to the full-parameter fine-tuning method, with pre-defined triggers remaining exploitable and pre-defined targets maintaining high confidence, even after fine-tuning. Motivated by this insight, we developed a Poisoned Sample Identification Module (PSIM) leveraging PEFT, which identifies poisoned samples through confidence, providing robust defense against weight-poisoning backdoor attacks. Specifically, we leverage PEFT to train the PSIM with randomly reset sample labels. During the inference process, extreme confidence serves as an indicator for poisoned samples, while others are clean. We conduct experiments on text classification tasks, five fine-tuning strategies, and three weight-poisoning backdoor attack methods. Experiments show near 100% success rates for weight-poisoning backdoor attacks when utilizing PEFT. Furthermore, our defensive approach exhibits overall competitive performance in mitigating weight-poisoning backdoor attacks.</description>

      <title>What Generative Artificial Intelligence Means for Terminological Definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT on the creation and consumption of terminological definitions. From the terminologist's point of view, the strategic use of GenAI tools can streamline the process of crafting definitions, reducing both time and effort, while potentially enhancing quality. GenAI tools enable AI-assisted terminography, notably post-editing terminography, where the machine produces a definition that the terminologist then corrects or refines. However, the potential of GenAI tools to fulfill all the terminological needs of a user, including term definitions, challenges the very existence of terminological definitions and resources as we know them. Unlike terminological definitions, GenAI tools can describe the knowledge activated by a term in a specific context. However, a main drawback of these tools is that their output can contain errors. For this reason, users requiring reliability will likely still resort to terminological resources for definitions. Nevertheless, with the inevitable integration of AI into terminology work, the distinction between human-created and AI-created content will become increasingly blurred.</description>

      <title>Rectifying Demonstration Shortcut in In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are able to solve various tasks with only a few demonstrations utilizing their in-context learning (ICL) abilities. However, LLMs often rely on their pre-trained semantic priors of demonstrations rather than on the input-label relationships to proceed with ICL prediction. In this work, we term this phenomenon as the 'Demonstration Shortcut'. While previous works have primarily focused on improving ICL prediction results for predefined tasks, we aim to rectify the Demonstration Shortcut, thereby enabling the LLM to effectively learn new input-label relationships from demonstrations. To achieve this, we introduce In-Context Calibration, a demonstration-aware calibration method. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in two settings: (1) the Original ICL Task using the standard label space and (2) the Task Learning setting, where the label space is replaced with semantically unrelated tokens. In both settings, In-Context Calibration demonstrates substantial improvements, with results generalized across three LLM families (OPT, GPT, and Llama2) under various configurations.</description>

      <title>STREAM: Spatio-TempoRal Evaluation and Analysis Metric for Video Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image generative models have made significant progress in generating realistic and diverse images, supported by comprehensive guidance from various evaluation metrics. However, current video generative models struggle to generate even short video clips, with limited tools that provide insights for improvements. Current video evaluation metrics are simple adaptations of image metrics by switching the embeddings with video embedding networks, which may underestimate the unique characteristics of video. Our analysis reveals that the widely used Frechet Video Distance (FVD) has a stronger emphasis on the spatial aspect than the temporal naturalness of video and is inherently constrained by the input size of the embedding networks used, limiting it to 16 frames. Additionally, it demonstrates considerable instability and diverges from human evaluations. To address the limitations, we propose STREAM, a new video evaluation metric uniquely designed to independently evaluate spatial and temporal aspects. This feature allows comprehensive analysis and evaluation of video generative models from various perspectives, unconstrained by video length. We provide analytical and experimental evidence demonstrating that STREAM provides an effective evaluation tool for both visual and temporal quality of videos, offering insights into area of improvement for video generative models. To the best of our knowledge, STREAM is the first evaluation metric that can separately assess the temporal and spatial aspects of videos. Our code is available at https://github.com/pro2nit/STREAM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) emphasize stimulating the large language models (LLM) on in-context learning, achieving significant results. Nevertheless, they face challenges when dealing with verbose database information and complex user intentions. This paper presents a two-stage framework to enhance the performance of current LLM-based natural language to SQL systems. We first introduce a novel prompt representation, called reference-enhanced representation, which includes schema information and randomly sampled cell values from tables to instruct LLMs in generating SQL queries. Then, in the first stage, question-SQL pairs are retrieved as few-shot demonstrations, prompting the LLM to generate a preliminary SQL (PreSQL). After that, the mentioned entities in PreSQL are parsed to conduct schema linking, which can significantly compact the useful information. In the second stage, with the linked schema, we simplify the prompt's schema information and instruct the LLM to produce the final SQL. Finally, as the post-refinement module, we propose using cross-consistency across different LLMs rather than self-consistency within a particular LLM. Our methods achieve new SOTA results on the Spider benchmark, with an execution accuracy of 87.6%.</description>

      <title>MedPromptX: Grounded Multimodal Prompting for Chest X-ray Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chest X-ray images are commonly used for predicting acute and chronic cardiopulmonary conditions, but efforts to integrate them with structured clinical data face challenges due to incomplete electronic health records (EHR). This paper introduces MedPromptX, the first model to integrate multimodal large language models (MLLMs), few-shot prompting (FP) and visual grounding (VG) to combine imagery with EHR data for chest X-ray diagnosis. A pre-trained MLLM is utilized to complement the missing EHR information, providing a comprehensive understanding of patients' medical history. Additionally, FP reduces the necessity for extensive training of MLLMs while effectively tackling the issue of hallucination. Nevertheless, the process of determining the optimal number of few-shot examples and selecting high-quality candidates can be burdensome, yet it profoundly influences model performance. Hence, we propose a new technique that dynamically refines few-shot data for real-time adjustment to new patient scenarios. Moreover, VG aids in focusing the model's attention on relevant regions of interest in X-ray images, enhancing the identification of abnormalities. We release MedPromptX-VQA, a new in-context visual question answering dataset encompassing interleaved image and EHR data derived from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR databases. Results demonstrate the SOTA performance of MedPromptX, achieving an 11% improvement in F1-score compared to the baselines.

      <title>FedAC: An Adaptive Clustered Federated Learning Framework for Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustered federated learning (CFL) is proposed to mitigate the performance deterioration stemming from data heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) by grouping similar clients for cluster-wise model training. However, current CFL methods struggle due to inadequate integration of global and intra-cluster knowledge and the absence of an efficient online model similarity metric, while treating the cluster count as a fixed hyperparameter limits flexibility and robustness. In this paper, we propose an adaptive CFL framework, named FedAC, which (1) efficiently integrates global knowledge into intra-cluster learning by decoupling neural networks and utilizing distinct aggregation methods for each submodule, significantly enhancing performance; (2) includes a costeffective online model similarity metric based on dimensionality reduction; (3) incorporates a cluster number fine-tuning module for improved adaptability and scalability in complex, heterogeneous environments. Extensive experiments show that FedAC achieves superior empirical performance, increasing the test accuracy by around 1.82% and 12.67% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively, under different non-IID settings compared to SOTA methods.</description>

Abstract: Conventional machine learning algorithms have traditionally been designed under the assumption that input data follows a vector-based format, with an emphasis on vector-centric paradigms. However, as the demand for tasks involving set-based inputs has grown, there has been a paradigm shift in the research community towards addressing these challenges. In recent years, the emergence of neural network architectures such as Deep Sets and Transformers has presented a significant advancement in the treatment of set-based data. These architectures are specifically engineered to naturally accommodate sets as input, enabling more effective representation and processing of set structures. Consequently, there has been a surge of research endeavors dedicated to exploring and harnessing the capabilities of these architectures for various tasks involving the approximation of set functions. This comprehensive survey aims to provide an overview of the diverse problem settings and ongoing research efforts pertaining to neural networks that approximate set functions. By delving into the intricacies of these approaches and elucidating the associated challenges, the survey aims to equip readers with a comprehensive understanding of the field. Through this comprehensive perspective, we hope that researchers can gain valuable insights into the potential applications, inherent limitations, and future directions of set-based neural networks. Indeed, from this survey we gain two insights: i) Deep Sets and its variants can be generalized by differences in the aggregation function, and ii) the behavior of Deep Sets is sensitive to the choice of the aggregation function. From these observations, we show that Deep Sets, one of the well-known permutation-invariant neural networks, can be generalized in the sense of a quasi-arithmetic mean.</description>

      <title>Gamba: Marry Gaussian Splatting with Mamba for single view 3D reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing a 3D asset from a single image with growing demands for automated 3D content creation pipelines. Previous methods primarily rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Despite their significant success, these approaches encounter practical limitations due to lengthy optimization and considerable memory usage. In this report, we introduce Gamba, an end-to-end amortized 3D reconstruction model from single-view images, emphasizing two main insights: (1) 3D representation: leveraging a large number of 3D Gaussians for an efficient 3D Gaussian splatting process; (2) Backbone design: introducing a Mamba-based sequential network that facilitates context-dependent reasoning and linear scalability with the sequence (token) length, accommodating a substantial number of Gaussians. Gamba incorporates significant advancements in data preprocessing, regularization design, and training methodologies. We assessed Gamba against existing optimization-based and feed-forward 3D generation approaches using the real-world scanned OmniObject3D dataset. Here, Gamba demonstrates competitive generation capabilities, both qualitatively and quantitatively, while achieving remarkable speed, approximately 0.6 second on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.</description>

      <title>Towards Human-Centered Construction Robotics: An RL-Driven Companion Robot For Contextually Assisting Carpentry Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the dynamic construction industry, traditional robotic integration has primarily focused on automating specific tasks, often overlooking the complexity and variability of human aspects in construction workflows. This paper introduces a human-centered approach with a "work companion rover" designed to assist construction workers within their existing practices, aiming to enhance safety and workflow fluency while respecting construction labor's skilled nature. We conduct an in-depth study on deploying a robotic system in carpentry formwork, showcasing a prototype that emphasizes mobility, safety, and comfortable worker-robot collaboration in dynamic environments through a contextual Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven modular framework. Our research advances robotic applications in construction, advocating for collaborative models where adaptive robots support rather than replace humans, underscoring the potential for an interactive and collaborative human-robot workforce.</description>

      <title>STaR-GATE: Teaching Language Models to Ask Clarifying Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When prompting language models to complete a task, users often leave important aspects unsaid. While asking questions could resolve this ambiguity (GATE; Li et al., 2023), models often struggle to ask good questions. We explore a language model's ability to self-improve (STaR; Zelikman et al., 2022) by rewarding the model for generating useful questions-a simple method we dub STaR-GATE. We generate a synthetic dataset of 25,500 unique persona-task prompts to simulate conversations between a pretrained language model-the Questioner-and a Roleplayer whose preferences are unknown to the Questioner. By asking questions, the Questioner elicits preferences from the Roleplayer. The Questioner is iteratively finetuned on questions that increase the probability of high-quality responses to the task, which are generated by an Oracle with access to the Roleplayer's latent preferences. After two iterations of self-improvement, the Questioner asks better questions, allowing it to generate responses that are preferred over responses from the initial model on 72% of tasks. Our results indicate that teaching a language model to ask better questions leads to better personalized responses.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Misattributed Suicide Causes through Annotation Inconsistency Detection in Death Investigation Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data accuracy is essential for scientific research and policy development. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) data is widely used for discovering the patterns and causes of death. Recent studies suggested the annotation inconsistencies within the NVDRS and the potential impact on erroneous suicide-cause attributions. We present an empirical Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to detect annotation inconsistencies and adopt a cross-validation-like paradigm to identify problematic instances. We analyzed 267,804 suicide death incidents between 2003 and 2020 from the NVDRS. Our results showed that incorporating the target state's data into training the suicide-crisis classifier brought an increase of 5.4% to the F-1 score on the target state's test set and a decrease of 1.1% on other states' test set. To conclude, we demonstrated the annotation inconsistencies in NVDRS's death investigation notes, identified problematic instances, evaluated the effectiveness of correcting problematic instances, and eventually proposed an NLP improvement solution.</description>
