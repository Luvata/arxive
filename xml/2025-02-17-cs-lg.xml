      <title>Channel Dependence, Limited Lookback Windows, and the Simplicity of Datasets: How Biased is Time Series Forecasting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting research has converged to a small set of datasets and a standardized collection of evaluation scenarios. Such a standardization is to a specific extent needed for comparable research. However, the underlying assumption is, that the considered setting is a representative for the problem as a whole. In this paper, we challenge this assumption and show that the current scenario gives a strongly biased perspective on the state of time-series forecasting research. To be more detailed, we show that the current evaluation scenario is heavily biased by the simplicity of the current datasets. We furthermore emphasize, that when the lookback-window is properly tuned, current models usually do not need any information flow across channels. However, when using more complex benchmark data, the situation changes: Here, modeling channel-interactions in a sophisticated manner indeed enhances performances. Furthermore, in this complex evaluation scenario, Crossformer, a method regularly neglected as an important baseline, is the SOTA method for time series forecasting. Based on this, we present the Fast Channel-dependent Transformer (FaCT), a simplified version of Crossformer which closes the runtime gap between Crossformer and TimeMixer, leading to an efficient model for complex forecasting datasets.</description>

      <title>A Novel Hybrid Approach to Contraceptive Demand Forecasting: Integrating Point Predictions with Probabilistic Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is vital for ensuring reliable access to contraceptive products, supporting key processes like procurement, inventory, and distribution. However, forecasting contraceptive demand in developing countries presents challenges, including incomplete data, poor data quality, and the need to account for multiple geographical and product factors. Current methods often rely on simple forecasting techniques, which fail to capture demand uncertainties arising from these factors, warranting expert involvement. Our study aims to improve contraceptive demand forecasting by combining probabilistic forecasting methods with expert knowledge. We developed a hybrid model that combines point forecasts from domain-specific model with probabilistic distributions from statistical and machine learning approaches, enabling human input to fine-tune and enhance the system-generated forecasts. This approach helps address the uncertainties in demand and is particularly useful in resource-limited settings. We evaluate different forecasting methods, including time series, Bayesian, machine learning, and foundational time series methods alongside our new hybrid approach. By comparing these methods, we provide insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and computational requirements. Our research fills a gap in forecasting contraceptive demand and offers a practical framework that combines algorithmic and human expertise. Our proposed model can also be generalized to other humanitarian contexts with similar data patterns.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques for Improved Pathological Staging of Prostate Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate cancer (Pca) continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men, and the limitations in precision of traditional diagnostic methods such as the Digital Rectal Exam (DRE), Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) testing, and biopsies underscore the critical importance of accurate staging detection in enhancing treatment outcomes and improving patient prognosis. This study leverages machine learning and deep learning approaches, along with feature selection and extraction methods, to enhance PCa pathological staging predictions using RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Gene expression profiles from 486 tumors were analyzed using advanced algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of the study is measured with respect to the F1-score, as well as precision and recall, all of which are calculated as weighted averages. The results reveal that the highest test F1-score, approximately 83%, was achieved by the Random Forest algorithm, followed by Logistic Regression at 80%, while both Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) scored around 79%. Furthermore, deep learning models with data augmentation achieved an accuracy of 71. 23%, while PCA-based dimensionality reduction reached an accuracy of 69.86%. This research highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches in clinical oncology, paving the way for more reliable diagnostic tools that can ultimately improve patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>NeuralCFD: Deep Learning on High-Fidelity Automotive Aerodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural operator learning are paving the way for transformative innovations in fields such as automotive aerodynamics. However, key challenges must be overcome before neural network-based simulation surrogates can be implemented at an industry scale. First, surrogates must become scalable to large surface and volume meshes, especially when using raw geometry inputs only, i.e., without relying on the simulation mesh. Second, surrogates must be trainable with a limited number of high-fidelity numerical simulation samples while still reaching the required performance levels. To this end, we introduce Geometry-preserving Universal Physics Transformer (GP-UPT), which separates geometry encoding and physics predictions, ensuring flexibility with respect to geometry representations and surface sampling strategies. GP-UPT enables independent scaling of the respective parts of the model according to practical requirements, offering scalable solutions to open challenges. GP-UPT circumvents the creation of high-quality simulation meshes, enables accurate 3D velocity field predictions at 20 million mesh cells, and excels in transfer learning from low-fidelity to high-fidelity simulation datasets, requiring less than half of the high-fidelity data to match the performance of models trained from scratch.</description>

      <title>Evaluating GPT's Capability in Identifying Stages of Cognitive Impairment from Electronic Health Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying cognitive impairment within electronic health records (EHRs) is crucial not only for timely diagnoses but also for facilitating research. Information about cognitive impairment often exists within unstructured clinician notes in EHRs, but manual chart reviews are both time-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue, our study evaluates an automated approach using zero-shot GPT-4o to determine stage of cognitive impairment in two different tasks. First, we evaluated the ability of GPT-4o to determine the global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) on specialist notes from 769 patients who visited the memory clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and achieved a weighted kappa score of 0.83. Second, we assessed GPT-4o's ability to differentiate between normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia on all notes in a 3-year window from 860 Medicare patients. GPT-4o attained a weighted kappa score of 0.91 in comparison to specialist chart reviews and 0.96 on cases that the clinical adjudicators rated with high confidence. Our findings demonstrate GPT-4o's potential as a scalable chart review tool for creating research datasets and assisting diagnosis in clinical settings in the future.</description>

      <title>NestQuant: Nested Lattice Quantization for Matrix Products and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent work have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Meta's SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3). Comparisons on various LLM evaluation benchmarks also show a reduction in performance degradation induced by quantization.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Social Welfare Frontier: Portfolios for Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL), deployed policies have varied impacts on different stakeholders, creating challenges in reaching consensus on how to effectively aggregate their preferences. Generalized $p$-means form a widely used class of social welfare functions for this purpose, with broad applications in fair resource allocation, AI alignment, and decision-making. This class includes well-known welfare functions such as Egalitarian, Nash, and Utilitarian welfare. However, selecting the appropriate social welfare function is challenging for decision-makers, as the structure and outcomes of optimal policies can be highly sensitive to the choice of $p$. To address this challenge, we study the concept of an $\alpha$-approximate portfolio in RL, a set of policies that are approximately optimal across the family of generalized $p$-means for all $p \in [-\infty, 1]$. We propose algorithms to compute such portfolios and provide theoretical guarantees on the trade-offs among approximation factor, portfolio size, and computational efficiency. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in summarizing the policy space induced by varying $p$ values, empowering decision-makers to navigate this landscape more effectively.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Foundation Models with Federated Learning for Privacy Preserving Medical Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a decentralized machine learning approach, where multiple devices or servers collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data, thus enabling data privacy. This approach has gained significant interest in academia and industry due to its privacy-preserving properties, which are particularly valuable in the medical domain where data availability is often protected under strict regulations. A relatively unexplored area is the use of FL to fine-tune Foundation Models (FMs) for time series forecasting, potentially enhancing model efficacy by overcoming data limitation while maintaining privacy. In this paper, we fine-tuned time series FMs with Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Impedance Cardiography (ICG) data using different FL techniques. We then examined various scenarios and discussed the challenges FL faces under different data heterogeneity configurations. Our empirical results demonstrated that while FL can be effective for fine-tuning FMs on time series forecasting tasks, its benefits depend on the data distribution across clients. We highlighted the trade-offs in applying FL to FM fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Differential Adjusted Parity for Learning Fair Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of fair and unbiased machine learning models remains an ongoing objective for researchers in the field of artificial intelligence. We introduce the Differential Adjusted Parity (DAP) loss to produce unbiased informative representations. It utilises a differentiable variant of the adjusted parity metric to create a unified objective function. By combining downstream task classification accuracy and its inconsistency across sensitive feature domains, it provides a single tool to increase performance and mitigate bias. A key element in this approach is the use of soft balanced accuracies. In contrast to previous non-adversarial approaches, DAP does not suffer a degeneracy where the metric is satisfied by performing equally poorly across all sensitive domains. It outperforms several adversarial models on downstream task accuracy and fairness in our analysis. Specifically, it improves the demographic parity, equalized odds and sensitive feature accuracy by as much as 22.5\%, 44.1\% and 40.1\%, respectively, when compared to the best performing adversarial approaches on these metrics. Overall, the DAP loss and its associated metric can play a significant role in creating more fair machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Discrete Diffusion with Causal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a flexible and controllable paradigm for structured sequence modeling, yet they still lag behind causal language models in expressiveness. To bridge the gap between two paradigms, we introduce CaDDi, a causal discrete diffusion model that unifies sequential and temporal modeling within a non-Markovian diffusion framework. Unlike conventional diffusion models that operate step by step with no access to prior states, CaDDi integrates the temporal trajectory, enabling more expressive and controllable generation. Our approach also treats causal language models as a special case, allowing seamless adoption of pretrained large language models (LLMs) for discrete diffusion without the need for architectural modifications. Empirically, we demonstrate that CaDDi outperforms state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models on both natural language and biological sequence tasks, narrowing the gap between diffusion-based methods and large-scale autoregressive transformers.</description>

      <title>Incentivize without Bonus: Provably Efficient Model-based Online Multi-agent RL for Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) lies at the heart of a plethora of applications involving the interaction of a group of agents in a shared unknown environment. A prominent framework for studying MARL is Markov games, with the goal of finding various notions of equilibria in a sample-efficient manner, such as the Nash equilibrium (NE) and the coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE). However, existing sample-efficient approaches either require tailored uncertainty estimation under function approximation, or careful coordination of the players. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based algorithm, called VMG, that incentivizes exploration via biasing the empirical estimate of the model parameters towards those with a higher collective best-response values of all the players when fixing the other players' policies, thus encouraging the policy to deviate from its current equilibrium for more exploration. VMG is oblivious to different forms of function approximation, and permits simultaneous and uncoupled policy updates of all players. Theoretically, we also establish that VMG achieves a near-optimal regret for finding both the NEs of two-player zero-sum Markov games and CCEs of multi-player general-sum Markov games under linear function approximation in an online environment, which nearly match their counterparts with sophisticated uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Medical Applications of Graph Convolutional Networks Using Electronic Health Records: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as a promising approach to machine learning on Electronic Health Records (EHRs). By constructing a graph representation of patient data and performing convolutions on neighborhoods of nodes, GCNs can capture complex relationships and extract meaningful insights to support medical decision making. This survey provides an overview of the current research in applying GCNs to EHR data. We identify the key medical domains and prediction tasks where these models are being utilized, common benchmark datasets, and architectural patterns to provide a comprehensive survey of this field. While this is a nascent area of research, GCNs demonstrate strong potential to leverage the complex information hidden in EHRs. Challenges and opportunities for future work are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Improving Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks on Keyboards Using Transformers and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of microphones in everyday devices and the growing reliance on online services have amplified the risk of acoustic side-channel attacks (ASCAs) targeting keyboards. This study explores deep learning techniques, specifically vision transformers (VTs) and large language models (LLMs), to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of such attacks. We present substantial improvements over prior research, with the CoAtNet model achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our CoAtNet shows a 5.0% improvement for keystrokes recorded via smartphone (Phone) and 5.9% for those recorded via Zoom compared to previous benchmarks. We also evaluate transformer architectures and language models, with the best VT model matching CoAtNet's performance. A key advancement is the introduction of a noise mitigation method for real-world scenarios. By using LLMs for contextual understanding, we detect and correct erroneous keystrokes in noisy environments, enhancing ASCA performance. Additionally, fine-tuned lightweight language models with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) deliver comparable performance to heavyweight models with 67X more parameters. This integration of VTs and LLMs improves the practical applicability of ASCA mitigation, marking the first use of these technologies to address ASCAs and error correction in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>ATM-Net: Adaptive Termination and Multi-Precision Neural Networks for Energy-Harvested Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ATM-Net is a novel neural network architecture tailored for energy-harvested IoT devices, integrating adaptive termination points with multi-precision computing. It dynamically adjusts computational precision (32/8/4-bit) and network depth based on energy availability via early exit points. An energy-aware task scheduler optimizes the energy-accuracy trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, PlantVillage, and TissueMNIST show ATM-Net achieves up to 96.93% accuracy while reducing power consumption by 87.5% with Q4 quantization compared to 32-bit operations. The power-delay product improves from 13.6J to 0.141J for DenseNet-121 and from 10.3J to 0.106J for ResNet-18, demonstrating its suitability for energy-harvesting systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Fair Policies for Infectious Diseases Mitigation using Path Integral Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infectious diseases pose major public health challenges to society, highlighting the importance of designing effective policies to reduce economic loss and mortality. In this paper, we propose a framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty to design fairness-aware disease mitigation policies that incorporate various measures of unfairness. Specifically, our approach learns equitable vaccination and lockdown strategies based on a stochastic multi-group SIR model. To address the challenges of solving the resulting sequential decision-making problem, we adopt the path integral control algorithm as an efficient solution scheme. Through a case study, we demonstrate that our approach effectively improves fairness compared to conventional methods and provides valuable insights for policymakers.</description>

      <title>Solving Empirical Bayes via Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work applies modern AI tools (transformers) to solving one of the oldest statistical problems: Poisson means under empirical Bayes (Poisson-EB) setting. In Poisson-EB a high-dimensional mean vector $\theta$ (with iid coordinates sampled from an unknown prior $\pi$) is estimated on the basis of $X=\mathrm{Poisson}(\theta)$. A transformer model is pre-trained on a set of synthetically generated pairs $(X,\theta)$ and learns to do in-context learning (ICL) by adapting to unknown $\pi$. Theoretically, we show that a sufficiently wide transformer can achieve vanishing regret with respect to an oracle estimator who knows $\pi$ as dimension grows to infinity. Practically, we discover that already very small models (100k parameters) are able to outperform the best classical algorithm (non-parametric maximum likelihood, or NPMLE) both in runtime and validation loss, which we compute on out-of-distribution synthetic data as well as real-world datasets (NHL hockey, MLB baseball, BookCorpusOpen). Finally, by using linear probes, we confirm that the transformer's EB estimator appears to internally work differently from either NPMLE or Robbins' estimators.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become a crucial component of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) to enhance transparency, trust, and clinical adoption. However, while many XAI methods have been proposed, their effectiveness in real-world medical settings remains underexplored. This paper provides a survey of human-centered evaluations of Explainable AI methods in Clinical Decision Support Systems. By categorizing existing works based on XAI methodologies, evaluation frameworks, and clinical adoption challenges, we offer a structured understanding of the landscape. Our findings reveal key challenges in the integration of XAI into healthcare workflows and propose a structured framework to align the evaluation methods of XAI with the clinical needs of stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Elastic Representation: Mitigating Spurious Correlations for Group Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models can suffer from severe performance degradation when relying on spurious correlations between input features and labels, making the models perform well on training data but have poor prediction accuracy for minority groups. This problem arises especially when training data are limited or imbalanced. While most prior work focuses on learning invariant features (with consistent correlations to y), it overlooks the potential harm of spurious correlations between features. We hereby propose Elastic Representation (ElRep) to learn features by imposing Nuclear- and Frobenius-norm penalties on the representation from the last layer of a neural network. Similar to the elastic net, ElRep enjoys the benefits of learning important features without losing feature diversity. The proposed method is simple yet effective. It can be integrated into many deep learning approaches to mitigate spurious correlations and improve group robustness. Moreover, we theoretically show that ElRep has minimum negative impacts on in-distribution predictions. This is a remarkable advantage over approaches that prioritize minority groups at the cost of overall performance.</description>

      <title>Automated Hypothesis Validation with Agentic Sequential Falsifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypotheses are central to information acquisition, decision-making, and discovery. However, many real-world hypotheses are abstract, high-level statements that are difficult to validate directly. This challenge is further intensified by the rise of hypothesis generation from Large Language Models (LLMs), which are prone to hallucination and produce hypotheses in volumes that make manual validation impractical. Here we propose Popper, an agentic framework for rigorous automated validation of free-form hypotheses. Guided by Karl Popper's principle of falsification, Popper validates a hypothesis using LLM agents that design and execute falsification experiments targeting its measurable implications. A novel sequential testing framework ensures strict Type-I error control while actively gathering evidence from diverse observations, whether drawn from existing data or newly conducted procedures. We demonstrate Popper on six domains including biology, economics, and sociology. Popper delivers robust error control, high power, and scalability. Furthermore, compared to human scientists, Popper achieved comparable performance in validating complex biological hypotheses while reducing time by 10 folds, providing a scalable, rigorous solution for hypothesis validation.</description>

      <title>Solvable Dynamics of Self-Supervised Word Embeddings and the Emergence of Analogical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models relies on their ability to implicitly learn structured latent representations from the pretraining corpus. As a simpler surrogate for representation learning in language modeling, we study a class of solvable contrastive self-supervised algorithms which we term quadratic word embedding models. These models resemble the word2vec algorithm and perform similarly on downstream tasks. Our main contributions are analytical solutions for both the training dynamics (under certain hyperparameter choices) and the final word embeddings, given in terms of only the corpus statistics. Our solutions reveal that these models learn orthogonal linear subspaces one at a time, each one incrementing the effective rank of the embeddings until model capacity is saturated. Training on WikiText, we find that the top subspaces represent interpretable concepts. Finally, we use our dynamical theory to predict how and when models acquire the ability to complete analogies.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic CLT and Error Bounds for Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms driven by martingale noise. Recent applications in machine learning motivate the need to understand finite-time error rates, but conventional stochastic approximation analysis focus on either asymptotic convergence in distribution or finite-time bounds that are far from optimal. Prior work on asymptotic central limit theorems (CLTs) suggest that two-time-scale algorithms may be able to achieve $1/\sqrt{n}$ error in expectation, with a constant given by the expected norm of the limiting Gaussian vector. However, the best known finite-time rates are much slower. We derive the first non-asymptotic central limit theorem with respect to the Wasserstein-1 distance for two-time-scale stochastic approximation with Polyak-Ruppert averaging. As a corollary, we show that expected error achieved by Polyak-Ruppert averaging decays at rate $1/\sqrt{n}$, which significantly improves on the rates of convergence in prior works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series modeling and analysis has become critical in various domains. Conventional methods such as RNNs and Transformers, while effective for discrete-time and regularly sampled data, face significant challenges in capturing the continuous dynamics and irregular sampling patterns inherent in real-world scenarios. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) represent a paradigm shift by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical rigor of differential equations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of NDE-based methods for time series analysis, including neural ordinary differential equations, neural controlled differential equations, and neural stochastic differential equations. We provide a detailed discussion of their mathematical formulations, numerical methods, and applications, highlighting their ability to model continuous-time dynamics. Furthermore, we address key challenges and future research directions. This survey serves as a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage NDEs for advanced time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Preserving Diffusion Models via Target Symmetrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for capturing complex distributions, but modeling data with inherent symmetries, such as molecular structures, remains challenging. Equivariant denoisers are commonly used to address this, but they introduce architectural complexity and optimization challenges, including noisy gradients and convergence issues. We propose a novel approach that enforces equivariance through a symmetrized loss function, which applies a time-dependent weighted averaging operation over group actions to the model's prediction target. This ensures equivariance without explicit architectural constraints and reduces gradient variance, leading to more stable and efficient optimization. Our method uses Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the average, incurring minimal computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees of equivariance for the minimizer of our loss function and demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic datasets and the molecular conformation generation task using the GEOM-QM9 dataset. Experiments show improved sample quality compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of our approach to enhance the scalability and practicality of equivariant diffusion models in generative tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The injectivity of ReLU layers in neural networks, the recovery of vectors from clipped or saturated measurements, and (real) phase retrieval in $\mathbb{R}^n$ allow for a similar problem formulation and characterization using frame theory. In this paper, we revisit all three problems with a unified perspective and derive lower Lipschitz bounds for ReLU layers and clipping which are analogous to the previously known result for phase retrieval and are optimal up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Thompson Sampling for Repeated Newsvendor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of Thompson Sampling (TS) for online learning with censored feedback, focusing primarily on the classic repeated newsvendor model--a foundational framework in inventory management--and demonstrating how our techniques can be naturally extended to a broader class of problems. We model demand using a Weibull distribution and initialize TS with a Gamma prior to dynamically adjust order quantities. Our analysis establishes optimal (up to logarithmic factors) frequentist regret bounds for TS without imposing restrictive prior assumptions. More importantly, it yields novel and highly interpretable insights on how TS addresses the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the repeated newsvendor setting. Specifically, our results show that when past order quantities are sufficiently large to overcome censoring, TS accurately estimates the unknown demand parameters, leading to near-optimal ordering decisions. Conversely, when past orders are relatively small, TS automatically increases future order quantities to gather additional demand information. Extensive numerical simulations further demonstrate that TS outperforms more conservative and widely-used approaches such as online convex optimization, upper confidence bounds, and myopic Bayesian dynamic programming. This study also lays the foundation for exploring general online learning problems with censored feedback.</description>

      <title>AttenGluco: Multimodal Transformer-Based Blood Glucose Forecasting on AI-READI Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistently high blood glucose levels (BGLs), leading to severe complications such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Predicting BGLs enables patients to maintain glucose levels within a safe range and allows caregivers to take proactive measures through lifestyle modifications. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems provide real-time tracking, offering a valuable tool for monitoring BGLs. However, accurately forecasting BGLs remains challenging due to fluctuations due to physical activity, diet, and other factors. Recent deep learning models show promise in improving BGL prediction. Nonetheless, forecasting BGLs accurately from multimodal, irregularly sampled data over long prediction horizons remains a challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose AttenGluco, a multimodal Transformer-based framework for long-term blood glucose prediction. AttenGluco employs cross-attention to effectively integrate CGM and activity data, addressing challenges in fusing data with different sampling rates. Moreover, it employs multi-scale attention to capture long-term dependencies in temporal data, enhancing forecasting accuracy. To evaluate the performance of AttenGluco, we conduct forecasting experiments on the recently released AIREADI dataset, analyzing its predictive accuracy across different subject cohorts including healthy individuals, people with prediabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we investigate its performance improvements and forgetting behavior as new cohorts are introduced. Our evaluations show that AttenGluco improves all error metrics, such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation, compared to the multimodal LSTM model. AttenGluco outperforms this baseline model by about 10% and 15% in terms of RMSE and MAE, respectively.</description>

      <title>Robust Anomaly Detection via Tensor Chidori Pseudoskeleton Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in modern data-driven applications, from identifying fraudulent transactions and safeguarding network infrastructure to monitoring sensor systems for irregular patterns. Traditional approaches, such as distance, density, or cluster-based methods, face significant challenges when applied to high dimensional tensor data, where complex interdependencies across dimensions amplify noise and computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper leverages Tensor Chidori pseudoskeleton decomposition within a tensor-robust principal component analysis framework to extract low Tucker rank structure while isolating sparse anomalies, ensuring robustness to anomaly detection. We establish theoretical results regarding convergence, and estimation error, demonstrating the stability and accuracy of the proposed approach. Numerical experiments on real-world spatiotemporal data from New York City taxi trip records validate the superiority of the proposed method in detecting anomalous urban events compared to existing benchmark methods. The results underscore the potential of Tensor Chidori pseudoskeleton decomposition to enhance anomaly detection for large-scale, high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein for Structured Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured data, such as graphs, are vital in machine learning due to their capacity to capture complex relationships and interactions. In recent years, the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance has attracted growing interest because it enables the comparison of structured data by jointly accounting for feature similarity and geometric structure. However, as a variant of optimal transport (OT), classical FGW assumes an equal mass constraint on the compared data. In this work, we relax this mass constraint and propose the Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein (FPGW) framework, which extends FGW to accommodate unbalanced data. Theoretically, we establish the relationship between FPGW and FGW and prove the metric properties of FPGW. Numerically, we introduce Frank-Wolfe solvers for the proposed FPGW framework and provide a convergence analysis. Finally, we evaluate the FPGW distance through graph classification and clustering experiments, demonstrating its robust performance, especially when data is corrupted by outlier noise.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Neural Topic Models with Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our study, we propose a self-supervised neural topic model (NTM) that combines the power of NTMs and regularized self-supervised learning methods to improve performance. NTMs use neural networks to learn latent topics hidden behind the words in documents, enabling greater flexibility and the ability to estimate more coherent topics compared to traditional topic models. On the other hand, some self-supervised learning methods use a joint embedding architecture with two identical networks that produce similar representations for two augmented versions of the same input. Regularizations are applied to these representations to prevent collapse, which would otherwise result in the networks outputting constant or redundant representations for all inputs. Our model enhances topic quality by explicitly regularizing latent topic representations of anchor and positive samples. We also introduced an adversarial data augmentation method to replace the heuristic sampling method. We further developed several variation models including those on the basis of an NTM that incorporates contrastive learning with both positive and negative samples. Experimental results on three datasets showed that our models outperformed baselines and state-of-the-art models both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>On Space Folds of ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent findings suggest that the consecutive layers of ReLU neural networks can be understood geometrically as space folding transformations of the input space, revealing patterns of self-similarity. In this paper, we present the first quantitative analysis of this space folding phenomenon in ReLU neural networks. Our approach focuses on examining how straight paths in the Euclidean input space are mapped to their counterparts in the Hamming activation space. In this process, the convexity of straight lines is generally lost, giving rise to non-convex folding behavior. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel measure based on range metrics, similar to those used in the study of random walks, and provide the proof for the equivalence of convexity notions between the input and activation spaces. Furthermore, we provide empirical analysis on a geometrical analysis benchmark (CantorNet) as well as an image classification benchmark (MNIST). Our work advances the understanding of the activation space in ReLU neural networks by leveraging the phenomena of geometric folding, providing valuable insights on how these models process input information.</description>

      <title>Data Valuation using Neural Networks for Efficient Instruction Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence functions provide crucial insights into model training, but existing methods suffer from large computational costs and limited generalization. Particularly, recent works have proposed various metrics and algorithms to calculate the influence of data using language models, which do not scale well with large models and datasets. This is because of the expensive forward and backward passes required for computation, substantial memory requirements to store large models, and poor generalization of influence estimates to new data. In this paper, we explore the use of small neural networks -- which we refer to as the InfluenceNetwork -- to estimate influence values, achieving up to 99% cost reduction. Our evaluation demonstrates that influence values can be estimated with models just 0.0027% the size of full language models (we use 7B and 8B versions). We apply our algorithm of estimating influence values (called NN-CIFT: Neural Networks for effiCient Instruction Fine-Tuning) to the downstream task of subset selection for general instruction fine-tuning. In our study, we include four state-of-the-art influence functions and show no compromise in performance, despite large speedups, between NN-CIFT and the original influence functions. We provide an in-depth hyperparameter analyses of NN-CIFT. The code for our method can be found here: https://github.com/agarwalishika/NN-CIFT.</description>

      <title>Exploring Neural Granger Causality with xLSTMs: Unveiling Temporal Dependencies in Complex Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality in time series can be difficult to determine, especially in the presence of non-linear dependencies. The concept of Granger causality helps analyze potential relationships between variables, thereby offering a method to determine whether one time series can predict-Granger cause-future values of another. Although successful, Granger causal methods still struggle with capturing long-range relations between variables. To this end, we leverage the recently successful Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture and propose Granger causal xLSTMs (GC-xLSTM). It first enforces sparsity between the time series components by using a novel dynamic lass penalty on the initial projection. Specifically, we adaptively improve the model and identify sparsity candidates. Our joint optimization procedure then ensures that the Granger causal relations are recovered in a robust fashion. Our experimental evaluations on three datasets demonstrate the overall efficacy of our proposed GC-xLSTM model.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Resource Allocation with Multi-task Learning for Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal solution to an optimization problem depends on the problem's objective function, constraints, and size. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven effective in solving optimization problems, changes in the problem's size, objectives, or constraints often require adjustments to the DNN architecture to maintain effectiveness, or even retraining a new DNN from scratch. Given the dynamic nature of wireless networks, which involve multiple and diverse objectives that can have conflicting requirements and constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) framework to enable a single DNN to jointly solve a range of diverse optimization problems. In this framework, optimization problems with varying dimensionality values, objectives, and constraints are treated as distinct tasks. To jointly address these tasks, we propose a conditional computation-based MTL approach with routing. The multi-task DNN consists of two components, the base DNN (bDNN), which is the single DNN used to extract the solutions for all considered optimization problems, and the routing DNN (rDNN), which manages which nodes and layers of the bDNN to be used during the forward propagation of each task. The output of the rDNN is a binary vector which is multiplied with all bDNN's weights during the forward propagation, creating a unique computational path through the bDNN for each task. This setup allows the tasks to either share parameters or use independent ones, with the decision controlled by the rDNN. The proposed framework supports both supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MTL approach in solving diverse optimization problems. In contrast, benchmark DNNs lacking the rDNN mechanism were unable to achieve similar levels of performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Classification of Temporal Graphs using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal graphs effectively model dynamic systems by representing interactions as timestamped edges. However, analytical tools for temporal graphs are limited compared to static graphs. We propose a novel method for analyzing temporal graphs using Persistent Homology. Our approach leverages $\delta$-temporal motifs (recurrent subgraphs) to capture temporal dynamics %without aggregation
  . By evolving these motifs, we define the \textit{average filtration} and compute PH on the associated clique complex. This method captures both local and global temporal structures and is stable with respect to reference models. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to the temporal graph classification task. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our approach, achieving over 92\% accuracy, with some cases reaching 100\%. Unlike existing methods that require node classes, our approach is node class free, offering flexibility for a wide range of temporal graph analysis.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Edge Classifier: Combining TinyML-Optimised CNN with RRAM-CMOS ACAM for Energy-Efficient Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the development of smart edge computing systems to process information locally is on the rise. Many near-sensor machine learning (ML) approaches have been implemented to introduce accurate and energy efficient template matching operations in resource-constrained edge sensing systems, such as wearables. To introduce novel solutions that can be viable for extreme edge cases, hybrid solutions combining conventional and emerging technologies have started to be proposed. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) optimised for edge application alongside new approaches of computing (both device and architecture -wise) could be a strong candidate in implementing edge ML solutions that aim at competitive accuracy classification while using a fraction of the power of conventional ML solutions. In this work, we are proposing a hybrid software-hardware edge classifier aimed at the extreme edge near-sensor systems. The classifier consists of two parts: (i) an optimised digital tinyML network, working as a front-end feature extractor, and (ii) a back-end RRAM-CMOS analogue content addressable memory (ACAM), working as a final stage template matching system. The combined hybrid system exhibits a competitive trade-off in accuracy versus energy metric with $E_{front-end}$ = $96.23 nJ$ and $E_{back-end}$ = $1.45 nJ$ for each classification operation compared with 78.06$\mu$J for the original teacher model, representing a 792-fold reduction, making it a viable solution for extreme edge applications.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to data generation in generative model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and other generative models are widely employed in artificial intelligence to synthesize new data. However, current approaches rely on Euclidean geometric assumptions and statistical approximations that fail to capture the structured and emergent nature of data generation. This paper introduces the Convergent Fusion Paradigm (CFP) theory, a novel geometric framework that redefines data generation by integrating dimensional expansion accompanied by qualitative transformation. By modifying the latent space geometry to interact with emergent high-dimensional structures, CFP theory addresses key challenges such as identifiability issues and unintended artifacts like hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). CFP theory is based on two key conceptual hypotheses that redefine how generative models structure relationships between data and algorithms. Through the lens of CFP theory, we critically examine existing metric-learning approaches. CFP theory advances this perspective by introducing time-reversed metric embeddings and structural convergence mechanisms, leading to a novel geometric approach that better accounts for data generation as a structured epistemic process. Beyond its computational implications, CFP theory provides philosophical insights into the ontological underpinnings of data generation. By offering a systematic framework for high-dimensional learning dynamics, CFP theory contributes to establishing a theoretical foundation for understanding the data-relationship structures in AI. Finally, future research in CFP theory will be led to its implications for fully realizing qualitative transformations, introducing the potential of Hilbert space in generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning on Out of Distribution in Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open-world assumption in model development suggests that a model might lack sufficient information to adequately handle data that is entirely distinct or out of distribution (OOD). While deep learning methods have shown promising results in handling OOD data through generalization techniques, they often require specialized hardware that may not be accessible to all users. We present TCL, a lightweight yet effective solution that operates efficiently on standard CPU hardware. Our approach adapts contrastive learning principles specifically for tabular data structures, incorporating full matrix augmentation and simplified loss calculation. Through comprehensive experiments across 10 diverse datasets, we demonstrate that TCL outperforms existing models, including FT-Transformer and ResNet, particularly in classification tasks, while maintaining competitive performance in regression problems. TCL achieves these results with significantly reduced computational requirements, making it accessible to users with limited hardware capabilities. This study also provides practical guidance for detecting and evaluating OOD data through straightforward experiments and visualizations. Our findings show that TCL offers a promising balance between performance and efficiency in handling OOD prediction tasks, which is particularly beneficial for general machine learning practitioners working with computational constraints.</description>

      <title>Data-Adaptive Low-Rank Sparse Subspace Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank sparse subspace clustering (LRSSC) algorithms built on self-expressive model effectively capture both the global and local structure of the data. However, existing solutions, primarily based on proximal operators associated with Sp/Lp , p e {0, 1/2, 2/3, 1}, norms are not data-adaptive. In this work, we propose an LRSSC algorithm incorporating a data-adaptive surrogate for the S0/L0 quasi-norm. We provide a numerical solution for the corresponding proximal operator in cases where an analytical expression is unavailable. The proposed LRSSC algorithm is formulated within the proximal mapping framework, and we present theoretical proof of its global convergence toward a stationary point. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on three well known datasets, comparing it against LRSSC algorithms constrained by Sp/Lp, p e {0, 1/2, 2/3, 1}, norms.</description>

      <title>NeuroXVocal: Detection and Explanation of Alzheimer's Disease through Non-invasive Analysis of Picture-prompted Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through non invasive methods remains a significant healthcare challenge. We present NeuroXVocal, a novel dual-component system that not only classifies but also explains potential AD cases through speech analysis. The classification component (Neuro) processes three distinct data streams: acoustic features capturing speech patterns and voice characteristics, textual features extracted from speech transcriptions, and precomputed embeddings representing linguistic patterns. These streams are fused through a custom transformer-based architecture that enables robust cross-modal interactions. The explainability component (XVocal) implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, leveraging Large Language Models combined with a domain-specific knowledge base of AD research literature. This architecture enables XVocal to retrieve relevant clinical studies and research findings to generate evidence-based context-sensitive explanations of the acoustic and linguistic markers identified in patient speech. Using the IS2021 ADReSSo Challenge benchmark dataset, our system achieved state-of-the-art performance with 95.77% accuracy in AD classification, significantly outperforming previous approaches. The explainability component was qualitatively evaluated using a structured questionnaire completed by medical professionals, validating its clinical relevance. NeuroXVocal's unique combination of high-accuracy classification and interpretable, literature-grounded explanations demonstrates its potential as a practical tool for supporting clinical AD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>COMBINEX: A Unified Counterfactual Explainer for Graph Neural Networks via Node Feature and Structural Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a powerful tool to unveil the opaque decision-making processes of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing techniques primarily focus on edge modifications, often overlooking the crucial role of node feature perturbations in shaping model predictions. To address this limitation, we propose COMBINEX, a novel GNN explainer that generates counterfactual explanations for both node and graph classification tasks. Unlike prior methods, which treat structural and feature-based changes independently, COMBINEX optimally balances modifications to edges and node features by jointly optimizing these perturbations. This unified approach ensures minimal yet effective changes required to flip a model's prediction, resulting in realistic and interpretable counterfactuals. Additionally, COMBINEX seamlessly handles both continuous and discrete node features, enhancing its versatility across diverse datasets and GNN architectures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets and various GNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Accelerometry-based Energy Expenditure Estimation During Activities of Daily Living: A Comparison Among Different Accelerometer Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) can be measured from breath-by-breath respiratory data, which can serve as a reference. Alternatively, PAEE can be predicted from the body movements, which can be measured and estimated with accelerometers. The body center of mass (COM) acceleration reflects the movements of the whole body and thus serves as a good predictor for PAEE. However, the wrist has also become a popular location due to recent advancements in wrist-worn devices. Therefore, in this work, using the respiratory data measured by COSMED K5 as the reference, we evaluated and compared the performances of COM-based settings and wrist-based settings. The COM-based settings include two different accelerometer compositions, using only the pelvis accelerometer (pelvis-acc) and the pelvis accelerometer with two accelerometers from two thighs (3-acc). The wrist-based settings include using only the left wrist accelerometer (l-wrist-acc) and only the right wrist accelerometer (r-wrist-acc). We implemented two existing PAEE estimation methods on our collected dataset, where 9 participants performed activities of daily living while wearing 5 accelerometers (i.e., pelvis, two thighs, and two wrists). These two methods include a linear regression (LR) model and a CNN-LSTM model. Both models yielded the best results with the COM-based 3-acc setting (LR: $R^2$ = 0.41, CNN-LSTM: $R^2$ = 0.53). No significant difference was found between the 3-acc and pelvis-acc settings (p-value = 0.278). For both models, neither the l-wrist-acc nor the r-wrist-acc settings demonstrated predictive power on PAEE with $R^2$ values close to 0, significantly outperformed by the two COM-based settings (p-values $&lt;$ 0.05). No significant difference was found between the two wrists (p-value = 0.329).</description>

      <title>SeWA: Selective Weight Average via Probabilistic Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weight averaging has become a standard technique for enhancing model performance. However, methods such as Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and Latest Weight Averaging (LAWA) often require manually designed procedures to sample from the training trajectory, and the results depend heavily on hyperparameter tuning. To minimize human effort, this paper proposes a simple yet efficient algorithm called Selective Weight Averaging (SeWA), which adaptively selects checkpoints during the final stages of training for averaging. Based on SeWA, we show that only a few points are needed to achieve better generalization and faster convergence. Theoretically, solving the discrete subset selection problem is inherently challenging. To address this, we transform it into a continuous probabilistic optimization framework and employ the Gumbel-Softmax estimator to learn the non-differentiable mask for each checkpoint. Further, we theoretically derive the SeWA's stability-based generalization bounds, which are sharper than that of SGD under both convex and non-convex assumptions. Finally, solid extended experiments in various domains, including behavior cloning, image classification, and text classification, further validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Modern Hopfield Networks with Continuous-Time Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has established a connection between modern Hopfield networks (HNs) and transformer attention heads, with guarantees of exponential storage capacity. However, these models still face challenges scaling storage efficiently. Inspired by psychological theories of continuous neural resource allocation in working memory, we propose an approach that compresses large discrete Hopfield memories into smaller, continuous-time memories. Leveraging continuous attention, our new energy function modifies the update rule of HNs, replacing the traditional softmax-based probability mass function with a probability density, over the continuous memory. This formulation aligns with modern perspectives on human executive function, offering a principled link between attractor dynamics in working memory and resource-efficient memory allocation. Our framework maintains competitive performance with HNs while leveraging a compressed memory, reducing computational costs across synthetic and video datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning Relational Tabular Data without Shared Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning relational tabular data has gained significant attention recently, but most studies focus on single tables, overlooking the potential of cross-table learning. Cross-table learning, especially in scenarios where tables lack shared features and pre-aligned data, offers vast opportunities but also introduces substantial challenges. The alignment space is immense, and determining accurate alignments between tables is highly complex. We propose Latent Entity Alignment Learning (Leal), a novel framework enabling effective cross-table training without requiring shared features or pre-aligned data. Leal operates on the principle that properly aligned data yield lower loss than misaligned data, a concept embodied in its soft alignment mechanism. This mechanism is coupled with a differentiable cluster sampler module, ensuring efficient scaling to large relational tables. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof of the cluster sampler's approximation capacity. Extensive experiments on five real-world and five synthetic datasets show that Leal achieves up to a 26.8% improvement in predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient RL under Episode-Wise Safety in Linear CMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the reinforcement learning (RL) problem in a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), where an agent explores the environment to maximize the expected cumulative reward while satisfying a single constraint on the expected total utility value in every episode. While this problem is well understood in the tabular setting, theoretical results for function approximation remain scarce. This paper closes the gap by proposing an RL algorithm for linear CMDPs that achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$ regret with an episode-wise zero-violation guarantee. Furthermore, our method is computationally efficient, scaling polynomially with problem-dependent parameters while remaining independent of the state space size. Our results significantly improve upon recent linear CMDP algorithms, which either violate the constraint or incur exponential computational costs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Generalization Power of a DNN in Terms of Symbolic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to analyze the generalization power of deep neural networks (DNNs) from the perspective of interactions. Unlike previous analysis of a DNN's generalization power in a highdimensional feature space, we find that the generalization power of a DNN can be explained as the generalization power of the interactions. We found that the generalizable interactions follow a decay-shaped distribution, while non-generalizable interactions follow a spindle-shaped distribution. Furthermore, our theory can effectively disentangle these two types of interactions from a DNN. We have verified that our theory can well match real interactions in a DNN in experiments.</description>

      <title>From Markov to Laplace: How Mamba In-Context Learns Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While transformer-based language models have driven the AI revolution thus far, their computational complexity has spurred growing interest in viable alternatives, such as structured state space sequence models (SSMs) and Selective SSMs. Among these, Mamba (S6) and its variant Mamba-2 have shown remarkable inference speed ups over transformers while achieving comparable or superior performance on complex language modeling tasks. However, despite these architectural innovations and empirical successes, the fundamental learning capabilities of Mamba remain poorly understood. In this paper, we address this gap by studying in-context learning (ICL) on Markov chains and uncovering a surprising phenomenon: unlike transformers, even a single-layer Mamba efficiently learns the in-context Laplacian smoothing estimator, which is both Bayes and minimax optimal, for all Markovian orders. To explain this, we theoretically characterize the representation capacity of Mamba and reveal the fundamental role of convolution in enabling it to represent the optimal Laplacian smoothing. These theoretical insights align strongly with empirical results and, to the best of our knowledge, represent the first formal connection between Mamba and optimal statistical estimators. Finally, we outline promising research directions inspired by these findings.</description>

      <title>Realistic Evaluation of Deep Partial-Label Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial-label learning (PLL) is a weakly supervised learning problem in which each example is associated with multiple candidate labels and only one is the true label. In recent years, many deep PLL algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However, we find that some early developed algorithms are often underestimated and can outperform many later algorithms with complicated designs. In this paper, we delve into the empirical perspective of PLL and identify several critical but previously overlooked issues. First, model selection for PLL is non-trivial, but has never been systematically studied. Second, the experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms. Third, there is a lack of real-world image datasets that can be compatible with modern network architectures. Based on these findings, we propose PLENCH, the first Partial-Label learning bENCHmark to systematically compare state-of-the-art deep PLL algorithms. We investigate the model selection problem for PLL for the first time, and propose novel model selection criteria with theoretical guarantees. We also create Partial-Label CIFAR-10 (PLCIFAR10), an image dataset of human-annotated partial labels collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk, to provide a testbed for evaluating the performance of PLL algorithms in more realistic scenarios. Researchers can quickly and conveniently perform a comprehensive and fair evaluation and verify the effectiveness of newly developed algorithms based on PLENCH. We hope that PLENCH will facilitate standardized, fair, and practical evaluation of PLL algorithms in the future.</description>

      <title>A Powerful Random Forest Featuring Linear Extensions (RaFFLE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random forests are widely used in regression. However, the decision trees used as base learners are poor approximators of linear relationships. To address this limitation we propose RaFFLE (Random Forest Featuring Linear Extensions), a novel framework that integrates the recently developed PILOT trees (Piecewise Linear Organic Trees) as base learners within a random forest ensemble. PILOT trees combine the computational efficiency of traditional decision trees with the flexibility of linear model trees. To ensure sufficient diversity of the individual trees, we introduce an adjustable regularization parameter and use node-level feature sampling. These modifications improve the accuracy of the forest. We establish theoretical guarantees for the consistency of RaFFLE under weak conditions, and its faster convergence when the data are generated by a linear model. Empirical evaluations on 136 regression datasets demonstrate that RaFFLE outperforms the classical CART and random forest methods, the regularized linear methods Lasso and Ridge, and the state-of-the-art XGBoost algorithm, across both linear and nonlinear datasets. By balancing predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, RaFFLE proves to be a versatile tool for tackling a wide variety of regression problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Reinforcement Learning for Actors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Reinforcement Learning (Dynamic RL), proposed in this paper, directly controls system dynamics, instead of the actor (action-generating neural network) outputs at each moment, bringing about a major qualitative shift in reinforcement learning (RL) from static to dynamic. The actor is initially designed to generate chaotic dynamics through the loop with its environment, enabling the agent to perform flexible and deterministic exploration. Dynamic RL controls global system dynamics using a local index called "sensitivity," which indicates how much the input neighborhood contracts or expands into the corresponding output neighborhood through each neuron's processing. While sensitivity adjustment learning (SAL) prevents excessive convergence of the dynamics, sensitivity-controlled reinforcement learning (SRL) adjusts them -- to converge more to improve reproducibility around better state transitions with positive TD error and to diverge more to enhance exploration around worse transitions with negative TD error. Dynamic RL was applied only to the actor in an Actor-Critic RL architecture while applying it to the critic remains a challenge. It was tested on two dynamic tasks and functioned effectively without external exploration noise or backward computation through time. Moreover, it exhibited excellent adaptability to new environments, although some problems remain. Drawing parallels between 'exploration' and 'thinking,' the author hypothesizes that "exploration grows into thinking through learning" and believes this RL could be a key technique for the emergence of thinking, including inspiration that cannot be reconstructed from massive existing text data. Finally, despite being presumptuous, the author presents the argument that this research should not proceed due to its potentially fatal risks, aiming to encourage discussion.</description>

      <title>AI-in-the-Loop Sensing and Communication Joint Design for Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), wireless communications, and sensing technologies have accelerated the evolution of edge intelligence. However, conventional systems still grapple with issues such as low communication efficiency, redundant data acquisition, and poor model generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative framework that enhances edge intelligence through AI-in-the-loop joint sensing and communication (JSAC). This framework features an AI-driven closed-loop control architecture that jointly optimizes system resources, thereby delivering superior system-level performance. A key contribution of our work is establishing an explicit relationship between validation loss and the system's tunable parameters. This insight enables dynamic reduction of the generalization error through AI-driven closed-loop control. Specifically, for sensing control, we introduce an adaptive data collection strategy based on gradient importance sampling, allowing edge devices to autonomously decide when to terminate data acquisition and how to allocate sample weights based on real-time model feedback. For communication control, drawing inspiration from stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), our joint optimization of transmission power and batch size converts channel and data noise into gradient perturbations that help mitigate overfitting. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our framework reduces communication energy consumption by up to 77 percent and sensing costs measured by the number of collected samples by up to 52 percent while significantly improving model generalization -- with up to 58 percent reductions of the final validation loss. It validates that the proposed scheme can harvest the mutual benefit of AI and JSAC systems by incorporating the model itself into the control loop of the system.</description>

      <title>Looking around you: external information enhances representations for event sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation learning produces models in different domains, such as store purchases, client transactions, and general people's behaviour. However, such models for sequential data usually process a single sequence, ignoring context from other relevant ones, even in domains with rapidly changing external environments like finance or misguiding the prediction for a user with no recent events.
  We are the first to propose a method that aggregates information from multiple user representations augmenting a specific user one for a scenario of multiple co-occurring event sequences. Our study considers diverse aggregation approaches, ranging from simple pooling techniques to trainable attention-based approaches, especially Kernel attention aggregation, that can highlight more complex information flow from other users. The proposed method operates atop an existing encoder and supports its efficient fine-tuning. Across considered datasets of financial transactions and downstream tasks, Kernel attention improves ROC AUC scores, both with and without fine-tuning, while mean pooling yields a smaller but still significant gain.</description>

      <title>SGS-GNN: A Supervised Graph Sparsification method for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SGS-GNN, a novel supervised graph sparsifier that learns the sampling probability distribution of edges and samples sparse subgraphs of a user-specified size to reduce the computational costs required by GNNs for inference tasks on large graphs. SGS-GNN employs regularizers in the loss function to enhance homophily in sparse subgraphs, boosting the accuracy of GNNs on heterophilic graphs, where a significant number of the neighbors of a node have dissimilar labels. SGS-GNN also supports conditional updates of the probability distribution learning module based on a prior, which helps narrow the search space for sparse graphs. SGS-GNN requires fewer epochs to obtain high accuracies since it learns the search space of subgraphs more effectively than methods using fixed distributions such as random sampling. Extensive experiments using 33 homophilic and heterophilic graphs demonstrate the following: (i) with only 20% of edges retained in the sparse subgraphs, SGS-GNN improves the F1-scores by a geometric mean of 4% relative to the original graph; on heterophilic graphs, the prediction accuracy is better up to 30%. (ii) SGS-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improvement in F1-scores of 4-7% in geometric mean with similar sparsities in the sampled subgraphs, and (iii) compared to sparsifiers that employ fixed distributions, SGS-GNN requires about half the number of epochs to converge.</description>

      <title>Control-flow anomaly detection by process mining-based feature extraction and dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The business processes of organizations may deviate from normal control flow due to disruptive anomalies, including unknown, skipped, and wrongly-ordered activities. To identify these control-flow anomalies, process mining can check control-flow correctness against a reference process model through conformance checking, an explainable set of algorithms that allows linking any deviations with model elements. However, the effectiveness of conformance checking-based techniques is negatively affected by noisy event data and low-quality process models. To address these shortcomings and support the development of competitive and explainable conformance checking-based techniques for control-flow anomaly detection, we propose a novel process mining-based feature extraction approach with alignment-based conformance checking. This variant aligns the deviating control flow with a reference process model; the resulting alignment can be inspected to extract additional statistics such as the number of times a given activity caused mismatches. We integrate this approach into a flexible and explainable framework for developing techniques for control-flow anomaly detection. The framework combines process mining-based feature extraction and dimensionality reduction to handle high-dimensional feature sets, achieve detection effectiveness, and support explainability. The results show that the framework techniques implementing our approach outperform the baseline conformance checking-based techniques while maintaining the explainable nature of conformance checking. We also provide an explanation of why existing conformance checking-based techniques may be ineffective.</description>

      <title>Forget the Data and Fine-Tuning! Just Fold the Network to Compress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce model folding, a novel data-free model compression technique that merges structurally similar neurons across layers, significantly reducing the model size without the need for fine-tuning or access to training data. Unlike existing methods, model folding preserves data statistics during compression by leveraging k-means clustering, and using novel data-free techniques to prevent variance collapse or explosion. Our theoretical framework and experiments across standard benchmarks, including ResNet18 and LLaMA-7B, demonstrate that model folding achieves comparable performance to data-driven compression techniques and outperforms recently proposed data-free methods, especially at high sparsity levels. This approach is particularly effective for compressing large-scale models, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Deep Recurrent Neural Networks and Bayesian Neural Networks for Detecting Electric Motor Damage Through Sound Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault detection in electric motors is a critical challenge in various industries, where failures can result in significant operational disruptions. This study investigates the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for diagnosing motor damage using acoustic signal analysis. A novel approach is proposed, leveraging frequency domain representation of sound signals for enhanced diagnostic accuracy. The architectures of both RNNs and BNNs are designed and evaluated on real-world acoustic data collected from household appliances using smartphones. Experimental results demonstrate that BNNs provide superior fault detection performance, particularly for imbalanced datasets, offering more robust and interpretable predictions compared to traditional methods. The findings suggest that BNNs, with their ability to incorporate uncertainty, are well-suited for industrial diagnostic applications. Further analysis and benchmarks are suggested to explore resource efficiency and classification capabilities of these architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process discovery aims to automatically derive process models from historical execution data (event logs). While various process discovery algorithms have been proposed in the last 25 years, there is no consensus on a dominating discovery algorithm. Selecting the most suitable discovery algorithm remains a challenge due to competing quality measures and diverse user requirements. Manually selecting the most suitable process discovery algorithm from a range of options for a given event log is a time-consuming and error-prone task. This paper introduces ProReco, a Process discovery Recommender system designed to recommend the most appropriate algorithm based on user preferences and event log characteristics. ProReco incorporates state-of-the-art discovery algorithms, extends the feature pools from previous work, and utilizes eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide explanations for its recommendations.</description>

      <title>Shaping Inductive Bias in Diffusion Models through Frequency-Based Noise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) are powerful generative models that have achieved unparalleled success in a number of generative tasks. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. For topologically structured data, we devise a frequency-based noising operator to purposefully manipulate, and set, these inductive biases. We first show that appropriate manipulations of the noising forward process can lead DPMs to focus on particular aspects of the distribution to learn. We show that different datasets necessitate different inductive biases, and that appropriate frequency-based noise control induces increased generative performance compared to standard diffusion. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of ignoring information at particular frequencies while learning. We show this in an image corruption and recovery task, where we train a DPM to recover the original target distribution after severe noise corruption.</description>

      <title>Efficient Zero-Order Federated Finetuning of Language Models for Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated fine-tuning offers a promising approach for tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, fine-tuning these models on edge devices remains challenging due to high memory, communication, and computational demands. Zero-order optimization with task alignment provides a potential solution, enabling fine-tuning with inference-level memory requirements but requires a longer convergence time. In this paper, we propose Federated Split-Perturbation Zero-order Optimization (FedSPZO) that divides the network into two blocks, applying a different number of perturbations per block in a computationally effective way, achieving faster convergence. Our evaluation shows a $2.5 - 7\times $ reduction in computation overhead compared to zero-order state of the art techniques in federated learning.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Super-Resolution for High-Fidelity Physical System Simulations with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is a promising tool for generating high-fidelity simulations of physical systems from low-resolution data, enabling fast and accurate predictions in engineering applications. However, existing deep-learning based SR methods, require large labeled datasets and lack reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ), limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a probabilistic SR framework that leverages the Statistical Finite Element Method and energy-based generative modeling. Our method enables efficient high-resolution predictions with inherent UQ, while eliminating the need for extensive labeled datasets. The method is validated on a 2D Poisson example and compared with bicubic interpolation upscaling. Results demonstrate a computational speed-up over high-resolution numerical solvers while providing reliable uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Mixup Unlearning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning is a critical area of research aimed at safeguarding data privacy by enabling the removal of sensitive information from machine learning models. One unique challenge in this field is catastrophic unlearning, where erasing specific data from a well-trained model unintentionally removes essential knowledge, causing the model to deviate significantly from a retrained one. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that regularizes the unlearning process by utilizing synthesized mixup samples, which simulate the data susceptible to catastrophic effects. At the core of our approach is a generator-unlearner framework, MixUnlearn, where a generator adversarially produces challenging mixup examples, and the unlearner effectively forgets target information based on these synthesized data. Specifically, we first introduce a novel contrastive objective to train the generator in an adversarial direction: generating examples that prompt the unlearner to reveal information that should be forgotten, while losing essential knowledge. Then the unlearner, guided by two other contrastive loss terms, processes the synthesized and real data jointly to ensure accurate unlearning without losing critical knowledge, overcoming catastrophic effects. Extensive evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, offering a robust solution to machine unlearning. This work not only deepens understanding of unlearning mechanisms but also lays the foundation for effective machine unlearning with mixup augmentation.</description>

      <title>Small Loss Bounds for Online Learning Separated Function Classes: A Gaussian Process Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to develop practical and efficient algorithms while circumventing overly pessimistic computational lower bounds, recent work has been interested in developing oracle-efficient algorithms in a variety of learning settings. Two such settings of particular interest are online and differentially private learning. While seemingly different, these two fields are fundamentally connected by the requirement that successful algorithms in each case satisfy stability guarantees; in particular, recent work has demonstrated that algorithms for online learning whose performance adapts to beneficial problem instances, attaining the so-called small-loss bounds, require a form of stability similar to that of differential privacy. In this work, we identify the crucial role that separation plays in allowing oracle-efficient algorithms to achieve this strong stability. Our notion, which we term $\rho$-separation, generalizes and unifies several previous approaches to enforcing this strong stability, including the existence of small-separator sets and the recent notion of $\gamma$-approximability. We present an oracle-efficient algorithm that is capable of achieving small-loss bounds with improved rates in greater generality than previous work, as well as a variant for differentially private learning that attains optimal rates, again under our separation condition. In so doing, we prove a new stability result for minimizers of a Gaussian process that strengthens and generalizes previous work.</description>

      <title>Fenchel-Young Variational Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a variational perspective, many statistical learning criteria involve seeking a distribution that balances empirical risk and regularization. In this paper, we broaden this perspective by introducing a new general class of variational methods based on Fenchel-Young (FY) losses, treated as divergences that generalize (and encompass) the familiar Kullback-Leibler divergence at the core of classical variational learning. Our proposed formulation -- FY variational learning -- includes as key ingredients new notions of FY free energy, FY evidence, FY evidence lower bound, and FY posterior. We derive alternating minimization and gradient backpropagation algorithms to compute (or lower bound) the FY evidence, which enables learning a wider class of models than previous variational formulations. This leads to generalized FY variants of classical algorithms, such as an FY expectation-maximization (FYEM) algorithm, and latent-variable models, such as an FY variational autoencoder (FYVAE). Our new methods are shown to be empirically competitive, often outperforming their classical counterparts, and most importantly, to have qualitatively novel features. For example, FYEM has an adaptively sparse E-step, while the FYVAE can support models with sparse observations and sparse posteriors.</description>

      <title>DeltaProduct: Increasing the Expressivity of DeltaNet Through Products of Householders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (linear RNNs) have emerged as competitive alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering efficient training and linear-time inference. However, existing architectures face a fundamental trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet and RWKVv7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the theoretical foundation of DeltaNet's expressivity by proving that it can solve dihedral group word problems in just two layers.</description>

      <title>SPIRIT: Short-term Prediction of solar IRradIance for zero-shot Transfer learning using Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional solar forecasting models are based on several years of site-specific historical irradiance data, often spanning five or more years, which are unavailable for newer photovoltaic farms. As renewable energy is highly intermittent, building accurate solar irradiance forecasting systems is essential for efficient grid management and enabling the ongoing proliferation of solar energy, which is crucial to achieve the United Nations' net zero goals. In this work, we propose SPIRIT, a novel approach leveraging foundation models for solar irradiance forecasting, making it applicable to newer solar installations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot transfer learning by about 70%, enabling effective performance at new locations without relying on any historical data. Further improvements in performance are achieved through fine-tuning, as more location-specific data becomes available. These findings are supported by statistical significance, further validating our approach. SPIRIT represents a pivotal step towards rapid, scalable, and adaptable solar forecasting solutions, advancing the integration of renewable energy into global power systems.</description>

      <title>ExplainReduce: Summarising local explanations via proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most commonly used non-linear machine learning methods are closed-box models, uninterpretable to humans. The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to develop tools to examine the inner workings of these closed boxes. An often-used model-agnostic approach to XAI involves using simple models as local approximations to produce so-called local explanations; examples of this approach include LIME, SHAP, and SLISEMAP. This paper shows how a large set of local explanations can be reduced to a small "proxy set" of simple models, which can act as a generative global explanation. This reduction procedure, ExplainReduce, can be formulated as an optimisation problem and approximated efficiently using greedy heuristics.</description>

      <title>Process Reward Models for LLM Agents: Practical Framework and Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Agent Process Reward Models (AgentPRM), a simple and scalable framework for training LLM agents to continually improve through interactions. AgentPRM follows a lightweight actor-critic paradigm, using Monte Carlo rollouts to compute reward targets and optimize policies. It requires minimal modifications to existing RLHF pipelines, making it easy to integrate at scale. Beyond AgentPRM, we propose InversePRM, which learns process rewards directly from demonstrations without explicit outcome supervision. We also explore key challenges and opportunities, including exploration, process reward shaping, and model-predictive reasoning. We evaluate on ALFWorld benchmark, show that small 3B models trained with AgentPRM and InversePRM outperform strong GPT-4o baselines, and analyze test-time scaling, reward hacking, and more. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sanjibanc/agent_prm.</description>

      <title>DiOpt: Self-supervised Diffusion for Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models show promising potential for learning-based optimization by leveraging their multimodal sampling capability to escape local optima. However, existing diffusion-based optimization approaches, often reliant on supervised training, lacks a mechanism to ensure strict constraint satisfaction which is often required in real-world applications. One resulting observation is the distributional misalignment, i.e. the generated solution distribution often exhibits small overlap with the feasible domain. In this paper, we propose DiOpt, a novel diffusion paradigm that systematically learns near-optimal feasible solution distributions through iterative self-training. Our framework introduces several key innovations: a target distribution specifically designed to maximize overlap with the constrained solution manifold; a bootstrapped self-training mechanism that adaptively weights candidate solutions based on the severity of constraint violations and optimality gaps; and a dynamic memory buffer that accelerates convergence by retaining high-quality solutions over training iterations. To our knowledge, DiOpt represents the first successful integration of self-supervised diffusion with hard constraint satisfaction. Evaluations on diverse tasks, including power grid control, motion retargeting, wireless allocation demonstrate its superiority in terms of both optimality and constraint satisfaction.</description>

      <title>InfoPos: A ML-Assisted Solution Design Support Framework for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variety of building blocks and algorithms incorporated in data-centric and ML-assisted solutions is high, contributing to two challenges: selection of most effective set and order of building blocks, as well as achieving such a selection with minimum cost. Considering that ML-assisted solution design is influenced by the extent of available data, as well as available knowledge of the target system, it is advantageous to be able to select matching building blocks. We introduce the first iteration of our InfoPos framework, allowing the placement of use-cases considering the available positions (levels), i.e., from poor to rich, of knowledge and data dimensions. With that input, designers and developers can reveal the most effective corresponding choice(s), streamlining the solution design process. The results from our demonstrator, an anomaly identification use-case for industrial Cyber-Physical Systems, reflects achieved effects upon the use of different building blocks throughout knowledge and data positions. The achieved ML model performance is considered as the indicator. Our data processing code and the composed data sets are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free Score Matching and Time Bootstrapping for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models generate samples by estimating the score function of the target distribution at various noise levels. The model is trained using samples drawn from the target distribution, progressively adding noise. In this work, we establish the first (nearly) dimension-free sample complexity bounds for learning these score functions, achieving a double exponential improvement in dimension over prior results. A key aspect of our analysis is the use of a single function approximator to jointly estimate scores across noise levels, a critical feature of diffusion models in practice which enables generalization across timesteps. Our analysis introduces a novel martingale-based error decomposition and sharp variance bounds, enabling efficient learning from dependent data generated by Markov processes, which may be of independent interest. Building on these insights, we propose Bootstrapped Score Matching (BSM), a variance reduction technique that utilizes previously learned scores to improve accuracy at higher noise levels. These results provide crucial insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion models for generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Proper Learnability and the Role of Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper learning refers to the setting in which learners must emit predictors in the underlying hypothesis class $H$, and often leads to learners with simple algorithmic forms (e.g. empirical risk minimization (ERM), structural risk minimization (SRM)). The limitation of proper learning, however, is that there exist problems which can only be learned improperly, e.g. in multiclass classification. Thus, we ask: Under what assumptions on the hypothesis class or the information provided to the learner is a problem properly learnable? We first demonstrate that when the unlabeled data distribution is given, there always exists an optimal proper learner governed by distributional regularization, a randomized generalization of regularization. We refer to this setting as the distribution-fixed PAC model, and continue to evaluate the learner on its worst-case performance over all distributions. Our result holds for all metric loss functions and any finite learning problem (with no dependence on its size). Further, we demonstrate that sample complexities in the distribution-fixed PAC model can shrink by only a logarithmic factor from the classic PAC model, strongly refuting the role of unlabeled data in PAC learning (from a worst-case perspective).
  We complement this with impossibility results which obstruct any characterization of proper learnability in the realizable PAC model. First, we observe that there are problems whose proper learnability is logically undecidable, i.e., independent of the ZFC axioms. We then show that proper learnability is not a monotone property of the underlying hypothesis class, and that it is not a local property (in a precise sense). Our impossibility results all hold even for the fundamental setting of multiclass classification, and go through a reduction of EMX learning (Ben-David et al., 2019) to proper classification which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>AffinityFlow: Guided Flows for Antibody Affinity Maturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibodies are widely used as therapeutics, but their development requires costly affinity maturation, involving iterative mutations to enhance binding affinity.This paper explores a sequence-only scenario for affinity maturation, using solely antibody and antigen sequences. Recently AlphaFlow wraps AlphaFold within flow matching to generate diverse protein structures, enabling a sequence-conditioned generative model of structure. Building on this, we propose an alternating optimization framework that (1) fixes the sequence to guide structure generation toward high binding affinity using a structure-based affinity predictor, then (2) applies inverse folding to create sequence mutations, refined by a sequence-based affinity predictor for post selection. To address this, we develop a co-teaching module that incorporates valuable information from noisy biophysical energies into predictor refinement. The sequence-based predictor selects consensus samples to teach the structure-based predictor, and vice versa. Our method, AffinityFlow, achieves state-of-the-art performance in affinity maturation experiments. We plan to open-source our code after acceptance.</description>

      <title>Balancing the Scales: A Theoretical and Algorithmic Framework for Learning from Imbalanced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially in multi-class problems with long-tailed distributions. Existing methods, such as data resampling, cost-sensitive techniques, and logistic loss modifications, though popular and often effective, lack solid theoretical foundations. As an example, we demonstrate that cost-sensitive methods are not Bayes consistent. This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for analyzing generalization in imbalanced classification. We propose a new class-imbalanced margin loss function for both binary and multi-class settings, prove its strong $H$-consistency, and derive corresponding learning guarantees based on empirical loss and a new notion of class-sensitive Rademacher complexity. Leveraging these theoretical results, we devise novel and general learning algorithms, IMMAX (Imbalanced Margin Maximization), which incorporate confidence margins and are applicable to various hypothesis sets. While our focus is theoretical, we also present extensive empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithms compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>(How) Can Transformers Predict Pseudo-Random Numbers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers excel at discovering patterns in sequential data, yet their fundamental limitations and learning mechanisms remain crucial topics of investigation. In this paper, we study the ability of Transformers to learn pseudo-random number sequences from linear congruential generators (LCGs), defined by the recurrence relation $x_{t+1} = a x_t + c \;\mathrm{mod}\; m$. Our analysis reveals that with sufficient architectural capacity and training data variety, Transformers can perform in-context prediction of LCG sequences with unseen moduli ($m$) and parameters ($a,c$). Through analysis of embedding layers and attention patterns, we uncover how Transformers develop algorithmic structures to learn these sequences in two scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we analyze how Transformers learn LCG sequences with unseen ($a, c$) but fixed modulus, and we demonstrate successful learning up to $m = 2^{32}$. Our analysis reveals that models learn to factorize the modulus and utilize digit-wise number representations to make sequential predictions. In the second, more challenging scenario of unseen moduli, we show that Transformers can generalize to unseen moduli up to $m_{\text{test}} = 2^{16}$. In this case, the model employs a two-step strategy: first estimating the unknown modulus from the context, then utilizing prime factorizations to generate predictions. For this task, we observe a sharp transition in the accuracy at a critical depth $=3$. We also find that the number of in-context sequence elements needed to reach high accuracy scales sublinearly with the modulus.</description>

      <title>iFormer: Integrating ConvNet and Transformer for Mobile Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new family of mobile hybrid vision networks, called iFormer, with a focus on optimizing latency and accuracy on mobile applications. iFormer effectively integrates the fast local representation capacity of convolution with the efficient global modeling ability of self-attention. The local interactions are derived from transforming a standard convolutional network, \textit{i.e.}, ConvNeXt, to design a more lightweight mobile network. Our newly introduced mobile modulation attention removes memory-intensive operations in MHA and employs an efficient modulation mechanism to boost dynamic global representational capacity. We conduct comprehensive experiments demonstrating that iFormer outperforms existing lightweight networks across various tasks. Notably, iFormer achieves an impressive Top-1 accuracy of 80.4\% on ImageNet-1k with a latency of only 1.10 ms on an iPhone 13, surpassing the recently proposed MobileNetV4 under similar latency constraints. Additionally, our method shows significant improvements in downstream tasks, including COCO object detection, instance segmentation, and ADE20k semantic segmentation, while still maintaining low latency on mobile devices for high-resolution inputs in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Transformer Based Time-Series Forecasting for Stock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To the naked eye, stock prices are considered chaotic, dynamic, and unpredictable. Indeed, it is one of the most difficult forecasting tasks that hundreds of millions of retail traders and professional traders around the world try to do every second even before the market opens. With recent advances in the development of machine learning and the amount of data the market generated over years, applying machine learning techniques such as deep learning neural networks is unavoidable. In this work, we modeled the task as a multivariate forecasting problem, instead of a naive autoregression problem. The multivariate analysis is done using the attention mechanism via applying a mutated version of the Transformer, "Stockformer", which we created.</description>

      <title>On the Bias, Fairness, and Bias Mitigation for a Wearable-based Freezing of Gait Detection in Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is a cause of injurious falls among PD patients. Recent advances in wearable-based human activity recognition (HAR) technology have enabled the detection of FOG subtypes across benchmark datasets. Since FOG manifestation is heterogeneous, developing models that quantify FOG consistently across patients with varying demographics, FOG types, and PD conditions is important. Bias and fairness in FOG models remain understudied in HAR, with research focused mainly on FOG detection using single benchmark datasets. We evaluated the bias and fairness of HAR models for wearable-based FOG detection across demographics and PD conditions using multiple datasets and the effectiveness of transfer learning as a potential bias mitigation approach. Our evaluation using demographic parity ratio (DPR) and equalized odds ratio (EOR) showed model bias (DPR &amp; EOR &lt; 0.8) for all stratified demographic variables, including age, sex, and disease duration. Our experiments demonstrated that transfer learning from multi-site datasets and generic human activity representations significantly improved fairness (average change in DPR +0.027, +0.039, respectively) and performance (average change in F1-score +0.026, +0.018, respectively) across attributes, supporting the hypothesis that generic human activity representations learn fairer representations applicable to health analytics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Simplicities of Attention: Adaptive Long-Context Head Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to process long contexts is crucial for many natural language processing tasks, yet it remains a significant challenge. While substantial progress has been made in enhancing the efficiency of attention mechanisms, there is still a gap in understanding how attention heads function in long-context settings. In this paper, we observe that while certain heads consistently attend to local information only, others swing between attending to local and long-context information depending on the query. This raises the question: can we identify which heads require long-context information to predict the next token accurately? We demonstrate that it's possible to predict which heads are crucial for long-context processing using only local keys. The core idea here is to exploit a simple model for the long-context scores via second moment approximations. These findings unveil simple properties of attention in the context of long sequences, and open the door to potentially significant gains in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Imit Diff: Semantics Guided Diffusion Transformer with Dual Resolution Fusion for Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visuomotor imitation learning enables embodied agents to effectively acquire manipulation skills from video demonstrations and robot proprioception. However, as scene complexity and visual distractions increase, existing methods that perform well in simple scenes tend to degrade in performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Imit Diff, a semanstic guided diffusion transformer with dual resolution fusion for imitation learning. Our approach leverages prior knowledge from vision language foundation models to translate high-level semantic instruction into pixel-level visual localization. This information is explicitly integrated into a multi-scale visual enhancement framework, constructed with a dual resolution encoder. Additionally, we introduce an implementation of Consistency Policy within the diffusion transformer architecture to improve both real-time performance and motion smoothness in embodied agent control.We evaluate Imit Diff on several challenging real-world tasks. Due to its task-oriented visual localization and fine-grained scene perception, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in complex scenes with visual distractions, including zero-shot experiments focused on visual distraction and category generalization. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Principled Data Selection for Alignment: The Hidden Risks of Difficult Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) often assumes that using more clean data yields better outcomes, overlooking the match between model capacity and example difficulty. Challenging this, we propose a new principle: Preference data vary in difficulty, and overly difficult examples hinder alignment, by exceeding the model's capacity. Through systematic experimentation, we validate this principle with three key findings: (1) preference examples vary in difficulty, as evidenced by consistent learning orders across alignment runs; (2) overly difficult examples significantly degrade performance across four LLMs and two datasets; and (3) the capacity of a model dictates its threshold for handling difficult examples, underscoring a critical relationship between data selection and model capacity. Building on this principle, we introduce Selective DPO, which filters out overly difficult examples. This simple adjustment improves alignment performance by 9-16% in win rates on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark compared to the DPO baseline, suppressing a series of DPO variants with different algorithmic adjustments. Together, these results illuminate the importance of aligning data difficulty with model capacity, offering a transformative perspective for improving alignment strategies in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/glorgao/SelectiveDPO.</description>

      <title>GraphCompNet: A Position-Aware Model for Predicting and Compensating Shape Deviations in 3D Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven algorithm for modeling and compensating shape deviations in additive manufacturing (AM), addressing challenges in geometric accuracy and batch production. While traditional methods, such as analytical models and metrology, laid the groundwork for geometric precision, they are often impractical for large-scale production. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have improved compensation precision, but issues remain in generalizing across complex geometries and adapting to position-dependent variations. We present a novel approach for powder bed fusion (PBF) processes, using GraphCompNet, which is a computational framework combining graph-based neural networks with a generative adversarial network (GAN)-inspired training process. By leveraging point cloud data and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs), GraphCompNet models complex shapes and incorporates position-specific thermal and mechanical factors. A two-stage adversarial training procedure iteratively refines compensated designs via a compensator-predictor architecture, offering real-time feedback and optimization. Experimental validation across diverse shapes and positions shows the framework significantly improves compensation accuracy (35 to 65 percent) across the entire print space, adapting to position-dependent variations. This work advances the development of Digital Twin technology for AM, enabling scalable, real-time monitoring and compensation, and addressing critical gaps in AM process control. The proposed method supports high-precision, automated industrial-scale design and manufacturing systems.</description>

      <title>DiffEx: Explaining a Classifier with Diffusion Models to Identify Microscopic Cellular Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models have been extensively applied to biological data across various modalities. Discriminative deep learning models have excelled at classifying images into categories (e.g., healthy versus diseased, treated versus untreated). However, these models are often perceived as black boxes due to their complexity and lack of interpretability, limiting their application in real-world biological contexts. In biological research, explainability is essential: understanding classifier decisions and identifying subtle differences between conditions are critical for elucidating the effects of treatments, disease progression, and biological processes. To address this challenge, we propose DiffEx, a method for generating visually interpretable attributes to explain classifiers and identify microscopic cellular variations between different conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffEx in explaining classifiers trained on natural and biological images. Furthermore, we use DiffEx to uncover phenotypic differences within microscopy datasets. By offering insights into cellular variations through classifier explanations, DiffEx has the potential to advance the understanding of diseases and aid drug discovery by identifying novel biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Image Super-Resolution with Guarantees via Conformal Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of generative ML foundation models for image super-resolution calls for robust and interpretable uncertainty quantification methods. We address this need by presenting a novel approach based on conformal prediction techniques to create a "confidence mask" capable of reliably and intuitively communicating where the generated image can be trusted. Our method is adaptable to any black-box generative model, including those locked behind an opaque API, requires only easily attainable data for calibration, and is highly customizable via the choice of a local image similarity metric. We prove strong theoretical guarantees for our method that span fidelity error control (according to our local image similarity metric), reconstruction quality, and robustness in the face of data leakage. Finally, we empirically evaluate these results and establish our method's solid performance.</description>

      <title>k-LLMmeans: Summaries as Centroids for Interpretable and Scalable LLM-Based Text Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce k-LLMmeans, a novel modification of the k-means clustering algorithm that utilizes LLMs to generate textual summaries as cluster centroids, thereby capturing contextual and semantic nuances often lost when relying on purely numerical means of document embeddings. This modification preserves the properties of k-means while offering greater interpretability: the cluster centroid is represented by an LLM-generated summary, whose embedding guides cluster assignments. We also propose a mini-batch variant, enabling efficient online clustering for streaming text data and providing real-time interpretability of evolving cluster centroids. Through extensive simulations, we show that our methods outperform vanilla k-means on multiple metrics while incurring only modest LLM usage that does not scale with dataset size. Finally, We present a case study showcasing the interpretability of evolving cluster centroids in sequential text streams. As part of our evaluation, we compile a new dataset from StackExchange, offering a benchmark for text-stream clustering.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Conflict-Aware Network for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to recognize human emotions by exploiting textual, acoustic, and visual modalities, and thus how to make full use of the interactions between different modalities is a central challenge of MSA. Interaction contains alignment and conflict aspects. Current works mainly emphasize alignment and the inherent differences between unimodal modalities, neglecting the fact that there are also potential conflicts between bimodal combinations. Additionally, multi-task learning-based conflict modeling methods often rely on the unstable generated labels. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-level conflict-aware network (MCAN) for multimodal sentiment analysis, which progressively segregates alignment and conflict constituents from unimodal and bimodal representations, and further exploits the conflict constituents with the conflict modeling branch. In the conflict modeling branch, we conduct discrepancy constraints at both the representation and predicted output levels, avoiding dependence on the generated labels. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MCAN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by overlapping symptoms, may be challenging. Brain imaging coupled with artificial intelligence has been previously proposed for diagnostic support, but most of these methods have been trained to discriminate only isolated diseases from controls. Here, we develop a novel machine learning framework, named lifespan tree of brain anatomy, dedicated to the differential diagnosis between multiple diseases simultaneously. It integrates the modeling of volume changes for 124 brain structures during the lifespan with non-linear dimensionality reduction and synthetic sampling techniques to create easily interpretable representations of brain anatomy over the course of disease progression. As clinically relevant proof- of-concept applications, we constructed a cognitive lifespan tree of brain anatomy for the differential diagnosis of six causes of neurodegenerative dementia and a motor lifespan tree of brain anatomy for the differential diagnosis of four causes of parkinsonism using 37594 MRI as a training dataset. This original approach enhanced significantly the efficiency of differential diagnosis in the external validation cohort of 1754 cases, outperforming existing state-of-the art machine learning techniques. Lifespan tree holds promise as a valuable tool for differential diagnostic in relevant clinical conditions, especially for diseases still lacking effective biological markers.</description>

      <title>Towards Virtual Clinical Trials of Radiology AI with Conditional Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform healthcare by enabling personalized and efficient care through data-driven insights. Although radiology is at the forefront of AI adoption, in practice, the potential of AI models is often overshadowed by severe failures to generalize: AI models can have performance degradation of up to 20% when transitioning from controlled test environments to clinical use by radiologists. This mismatch raises concerns that radiologists will be misled by incorrect AI predictions in practice and/or grow to distrust AI, rendering these promising technologies practically ineffectual. Exhaustive clinical trials of AI models on abundant and diverse data is thus critical to anticipate AI model degradation when encountering varied data samples. Achieving these goals, however, is challenging due to the high costs of collecting diverse data samples and corresponding annotations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel conditional generative AI model designed for virtual clinical trials (VCTs) of radiology AI, capable of realistically synthesizing full-body CT images of patients with specified attributes. By learning the joint distribution of images and anatomical structures, our model enables precise replication of real-world patient populations with unprecedented detail at this scale. We demonstrate meaningful evaluation of radiology AI models through VCTs powered by our synthetic CT study populations, revealing model degradation and facilitating algorithmic auditing for bias-inducing data attributes. Our generative AI approach to VCTs is a promising avenue towards a scalable solution to assess model robustness, mitigate biases, and safeguard patient care by enabling simpler testing and evaluation of AI models in any desired range of diverse patient populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a method to prepare a warm-started quantum state from measurements with an iterative framework to enhance the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA). The numerical simulations show the method can effectively address the "stuck issue" of the standard QAOA using a single-string warm-started initial state described in [Cain et al., 2023]. When applied to the $3$-regular MaxCut problem, our approach achieves an improved approximation ratio, with a lower bound that iteratively converges toward the best classical algorithms for $p=1$ standard QAOA. Additionally, in the context of the discrete global minimal variance portfolio (DGMVP) model, simulations reveal a more favourable scaling of identifying the global minimal compared to the QAOA standalone, the single-string warm-started QAOA and a classical constrained sampling approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically represent numbers using multiple tokens, which requires the model to aggregate these tokens to interpret numerical values. This fragmentation makes both training and inference less efficient and adversely affects the model's performance on number-related tasks. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained LLMs internally learn Fourier-like features for number tokens, we propose Fourier Number Embedding (FoNE), a novel method that directly maps numbers into the embedding space with their Fourier features. FoNE encodes each number as a single token with only two embedding dimensions per digit, effectively capturing numerical values without fragmentation. This compact representation accelerates both training and inference. Compared to traditional subword and digit-wise embeddings, FoNE not only reduces computational overhead but also achieves higher accuracy across various numerical tasks including addition, subtraction and multiplication. On 6-digit decimal addition, FoNE requires 64$\times$ less data to achieve 99% accuracy than subword and digit-wise embeddings while using 3$\times$ and 6$\times$ fewer tokens per number, respectively. Furthermore, FoNE is the only method that yields 100% accuracy on over 100,000 test examples for addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

      <title>Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks via Compliance-Refusal-Based Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks aim to exploit large language models (LLMs) and pose a significant threat to their proper conduct; they seek to bypass models' safeguards and often provoke transgressive behaviors. However, existing automatic jailbreak attacks require extensive computational resources and are prone to converge on suboptimal solutions. In this work, we propose \textbf{C}ompliance \textbf{R}efusal \textbf{I}nitialization (CRI), a novel, attack-agnostic framework that efficiently initializes the optimization in the proximity of the compliance subspace of harmful prompts. By narrowing the initial gap to the adversarial objective, CRI substantially improves adversarial success rates (ASR) and drastically reduces computational overhead -- often requiring just a single optimization step. We evaluate CRI on the widely-used AdvBench dataset over the standard jailbreak attacks of GCG and AutoDAN. Results show that CRI boosts ASR and decreases the median steps to success by up to \textbf{\(\times 60\)}. The project page, along with the reference implementation, is publicly available at \texttt{https://amit1221levi.github.io/CRI-Jailbreak-Init-LLMs-evaluation/}.</description>

      <title>CellFlow: Simulating Cellular Morphology Changes via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce CellFlow, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlow models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlow generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlow enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research.</description>

      <title>ExoMiner++ on TESS with Transfer Learning from Kepler: Transit Classification and Vetting Catalog for 2-min Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the success of ExoMiner to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further enhance performance, we leverage transfer learning from high-quality labeled data from the Kepler space telescope, mitigating the impact of TESS's noisier and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space for follow-up investigations to confirm new planets. To serve the exoplanet community, we introduce new TESS catalogs containing ExoMiner++ classifications and confidence scores for each transit signal. Among the 147,568 unlabeled TCEs, ExoMiner++ identifies 7,330 as planet candidates, with the remainder classified as false positives. These 7,330 planet candidates correspond to 1,868 existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), 69 Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs), and 50 newly introduced CTOIs. 1,797 out of the 2,506 TOIs previously labeled as planet candidates in ExoFOP are classified as planet candidates by ExoMiner++. This reduction in plausible candidates combined with the excellent ranking quality of ExoMiner++ allows the follow-up efforts to be focused on the most likely candidates, increasing the overall planet yield.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of frequency-localized functions from pointwise samples via least squares and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering frequency-localized functions from pointwise data is a fundamental task in signal processing. We examine this problem from an approximation-theoretic perspective, focusing on least squares and deep learning-based methods. First, we establish a novel recovery theorem for least squares approximations using the Slepian basis from uniform random samples in low dimensions, explicitly tracking the dependence of the bandwidth on the sampling complexity. Building on these results, we then present a recovery guarantee for approximating bandlimited functions via deep learning from pointwise data. This result, framed as a practical existence theorem, provides conditions on the network architecture, training procedure, and data acquisition sufficient for accurate approximation. To complement our theoretical findings, we perform numerical comparisons between least squares and deep learning for approximating one- and two-dimensional functions. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical limitations and the practical gaps between theory and implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thousands of individuals succumb annually to leukemia alone. As artificial intelligence-driven technologies continue to evolve and advance, the question of their applicability and reliability remains unresolved. This study aims to utilize image processing and deep learning methodologies to achieve state-of-the-art results for the detection of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) using data that best represents real-world scenarios. ALL is one of several types of blood cancer, and it is an aggressive form of leukemia. In this investigation, we examine the most recent advancements in ALL detection, as well as the latest iteration of the YOLO series and its performance. We address the question of whether white blood cells are malignant or benign. Additionally, the proposed models can identify different ALL stages, including early stages. Furthermore, these models can detect hematogones despite their frequent misclassification as ALL. By utilizing advanced deep learning models, namely, YOLOv8, YOLOv11, ResNet50 and Inception-ResNet-v2, the study achieves accuracy rates as high as 99.7%, demonstrating the effectiveness of these algorithms across multiple datasets and various real-world situations.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM and early dark energy in latent space: a data-driven parametrization of the CMB temperature power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the best parametrization for cosmological models in the absence of first-principle theories is an open question. We propose a data-driven parametrization of cosmological models given by the disentangled 'latent' representation of a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained to compress cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature power spectra. We consider a broad range of $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies with an additional early dark energy (EDE) component. We show that these spectra can be compressed into 5 ($\Lambda$CDM) or 8 (EDE) independent latent parameters, as expected when using temperature power spectra alone, and which reconstruct spectra at an accuracy well within the Planck errors. These latent parameters have a physical interpretation in terms of well-known features of the CMB temperature spectrum: these include the position, height and even-odd modulation of the acoustic peaks, as well as the gravitational lensing effect. The VAE also discovers one latent parameter which entirely isolates the EDE effects from those related to $\Lambda$CDM parameters, thus revealing a previously unknown degree of freedom in the CMB temperature power spectrum. We further showcase how to place constraints on the latent parameters using Planck data as typically done for cosmological parameters, obtaining latent values consistent with previous $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmological constraints. Our work demonstrates the potential of a data-driven reformulation of current beyond-$\Lambda$CDM phenomenological models into the independent degrees of freedom to which the data observables are sensitive.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, remarkable advancements in deep- fake generation technology have led to unprecedented leaps in its realism and capabilities. Despite these advances, we observe a notable lack of structured and deep analysis deepfake technology. The principal aim of this survey is to contribute a thorough theoretical analysis of state-of-the-art face deepfake generation and detection methods. Furthermore, we provide a coherent and systematic evaluation of the implications of deepfakes on face biometric recognition approaches. In addition, we outline key applications of face deepfake technology, elucidating both positive and negative applications of the technology, provide a detailed discussion regarding the gaps in existing research, and propose key research directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>A Solver-Aided Hierarchical Language for LLM-Driven CAD Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been enormously successful in solving a wide variety of structured and unstructured generative tasks, but they struggle to generate procedural geometry in Computer Aided Design (CAD). These difficulties arise from an inability to do spatial reasoning and the necessity to guide a model through complex, long range planning to generate complex geometry. We enable generative CAD Design with LLMs through the introduction of a solver-aided, hierarchical domain specific language (DSL) called AIDL, which offloads the spatial reasoning requirements to a geometric constraint solver. Additionally, we show that in the few-shot regime, AIDL outperforms even a language with in-training data (OpenSCAD), both in terms of generating visual results closer to the prompt and creating objects that are easier to post-process and reason about.</description>

      <title>Efficient Evaluation of Multi-Task Robot Policies With Active Experiment Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating learned robot control policies to determine their physical task-level capabilities costs experimenter time and effort. The growing number of policies and tasks exacerbates this issue. It is impractical to test every policy on every task multiple times; each trial requires a manual environment reset, and each task change involves re-arranging objects or even changing robots. Naively selecting a random subset of tasks and policies to evaluate is a high-cost solution with unreliable, incomplete results. In this work, we formulate robot evaluation as an active testing problem. We propose to model the distribution of robot performance across all tasks and policies as we sequentially execute experiments. Tasks often share similarities that can reveal potential relationships in policy behavior, and we show that natural language is a useful prior in modeling these relationships between tasks. We then leverage this formulation to reduce the experimenter effort by using a cost-aware expected information gain heuristic to efficiently select informative trials. Our framework accommodates both continuous and discrete performance outcomes. We conduct experiments on existing evaluation data from real robots and simulations. By prioritizing informative trials, our framework reduces the cost of calculating evaluation metrics for robot policies across many tasks.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic contiguity from low-degree conjecture and applications in correlated random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, assuming a natural strengthening of the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness for two problems: (1) the (partial) matching recovery problem in the sparse correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,q;\rho)$ when the edge-density $q=n^{-1+o(1)}$ and the correlation $\rho&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{DDL23+}; (2) the detection problem between the correlated sparse stochastic block model $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n};k,\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon^2 \lambda s&lt;1$ lies below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold and $s&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{CDGL24+}.
  One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=\Omega(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that small language models (SLMs), specifically a 100M parameter GPT-2 model, can achieve competitive performance in multitask prompt generation tasks while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources needed by large language models (LLMs). Through a novel combination of upside-down reinforcement learning and synthetic data distillation from a powerful LLM, Llama-3, we train an SLM that achieves relevance scores within 5% of state-of-the-art models, including Llama-3, Qwen2, and Mistral, despite being up to 80 times smaller, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained and real-time applications. This study highlights the potential of SLMs as efficient multitask learners in multimodal settings, providing a promising alternative to LLMs for scalable, low-latency deployments.</description>

      <title>Gradient GA: Gradient Genetic Algorithm for Drug Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular discovery has brought great benefits to the chemical industry. Various molecule design techniques are developed to identify molecules with desirable properties. Traditional optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, continue to achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple molecular design benchmarks. However, these techniques rely solely on random walk exploration, which hinders both the quality of the final solution and the convergence speed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called Gradient Genetic Algorithm (Gradient GA), which incorporates gradient information from the objective function into genetic algorithms. Instead of random exploration, each proposed sample iteratively progresses toward an optimal solution by following the gradient direction. We achieve this by designing a differentiable objective function parameterized by a neural network and utilizing the Discrete Langevin Proposal to enable gradient guidance in discrete molecular spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves both convergence speed and solution quality, outperforming cutting-edge techniques. For example, it achieves up to a 25% improvement in the top-10 score over the vanilla genetic algorithm. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/debadyuti23/GradientGA.</description>

      <title>How Users Who are Blind or Low Vision Play Mobile Games: Perceptions, Challenges, and Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As blind and low-vision (BLV) players engage more deeply with games, accessibility features have become essential. While some research has explored tools and strategies to enhance game accessibility, the specific experiences of these players with mobile games remain underexamined. This study addresses this gap by investigating how BLV users experience mobile games with varying accessibility levels. Through interviews with 32 experienced BLV mobile players, we explore their perceptions, challenges, and strategies for engaging with mobile games. Our findings reveal that BLV players turn to mobile games to alleviate boredom, achieve a sense of accomplishment, and build social connections, but face barriers depending on the game's accessibility level. We also compare mobile games to other forms of gaming, highlighting the relative advantages of mobile games, such as the inherent accessibility of smartphones. This study contributes to understanding BLV mobile gaming experiences and provides insights for enhancing accessible mobile game design.</description>

      <title>Learning to Calibrate for Reliable Visual Fire Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fire is characterized by its sudden onset and destructive power, making early fire detection crucial for ensuring human safety and protecting property. With the advancement of deep learning, the application of computer vision in fire detection has significantly improved. However, deep learning models often exhibit a tendency toward overconfidence, and most existing works focus primarily on enhancing classification performance, with limited attention given to uncertainty modeling. To address this issue, we propose transforming the Expected Calibration Error (ECE), a metric for measuring uncertainty, into a differentiable ECE loss function. This loss is then combined with the cross-entropy loss to guide the training process of multi-class fire detection models. Additionally, to achieve a good balance between classification accuracy and reliable decision, we introduce a curriculum learning-based approach that dynamically adjusts the weight of the ECE loss during training. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used multi-class fire detection datasets, DFAN and EdgeFireSmoke, validating the effectiveness of our uncertainty modeling method.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Early Warnings using Machine Learning in an Online Game-experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stemming from physics and later applied to other fields such as ecology, the theory of critical transitions suggests that some regime shifts are preceded by statistical early warning signals. Reddit's r/place experiment, a large-scale social game, provides a unique opportunity to test these signals consistently across thousands of subsystems undergoing critical transitions. In r/place, millions of users collaboratively created compositions, or pixel-art drawings, in which transitions occur when one composition rapidly replaces another. We develop a machine-learning-based early warning system that combines the predictive power of multiple system-specific time series via gradient-boosted decision trees with memory-retaining features. Our method significantly outperforms standard early warning indicators. Trained on the 2022 r/place data, our algorithm detects half of the transitions occurring within 20 minutes at a false positive rate of just 3.7%. Its performance remains robust when tested on the 2023 r/place event, demonstrating generalizability across different contexts. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpreting the predictions, we investigate the underlying drivers of warnings, which could be relevant to other complex systems, especially online social systems. We reveal an interplay of patterns preceding transitions, such as critical slowing down or speeding up, a lack of innovation or coordination, turbulent histories, and a lack of image complexity. These findings show the potential of machine learning indicators in socio-ecological systems for predicting regime shifts and understanding their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Video2Policy: Scaling up Manipulation Tasks in Simulation through Internet Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation offers a promising approach for cheaply scaling training data for generalist policies. To scalably generate data from diverse and realistic tasks, existing algorithms either rely on large language models (LLMs) that may hallucinate tasks not interesting for robotics; or digital twins, which require careful real-to-sim alignment and are hard to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce Video2Policy, a novel framework that leverages internet RGB videos to reconstruct tasks based on everyday human behavior. Our approach comprises two phases: (1) task generation in simulation from videos; and (2) reinforcement learning utilizing in-context LLM-generated reward functions iteratively. We demonstrate the efficacy of Video2Policy by reconstructing over 100 videos from the Something-Something-v2 (SSv2) dataset, which depicts diverse and complex human behaviors on 9 different tasks. Our method can successfully train RL policies on such tasks, including complex and challenging tasks such as throwing. Finally, we show that the generated simulation data can be scaled up for training a general policy, and it can be transferred back to the real robot in a Real2Sim2Real way.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Improving Graph-based Explanation Methods for Multi-Agent Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), developed by the graph learning community, have been adopted and shown to be highly effective in multi-robot and multi-agent learning. Inspired by this successful cross-pollination, we investigate and characterize the suitability of existing GNN explanation methods for explaining multi-agent coordination. We find that these methods have the potential to identify the most-influential communication channels that impact the team's behavior. Informed by our initial analyses, we propose an attention entropy regularization term that renders GAT-based policies more amenable to existing graph-based explainers. Intuitively, minimizing attention entropy incentivizes agents to limit their attention to the most influential or impactful agents, thereby easing the challenge faced by the explainer. We theoretically ground this intuition by showing that minimizing attention entropy increases the disparity between the explainer-generated subgraph and its complement. Evaluations across three tasks and three team sizes i) provides insights into the effectiveness of existing explainers, and ii) demonstrates that our proposed regularization consistently improves explanation quality without sacrificing task performance.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Spectroscopy: Advancing Chemistry from Prediction to Generation and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) has catalyzed major transformations in chemistry, yet the application of these methods to spectroscopic and spectrometric data, referred to as Spectroscopy Machine Learning (SpectraML), remains relatively underexplored. Modern spectroscopic techniques (MS, NMR, IR, Raman, UV-Vis) generate an ever-growing volume of high-dimensional data, creating a pressing need for automated and intelligent analysis beyond traditional expert-based workflows. In this survey, we provide a unified review of SpectraML, systematically examining state-of-the-art approaches for both forward tasks (molecule-to-spectrum prediction) and inverse tasks (spectrum-to-molecule inference). We trace the historical evolution of ML in spectroscopy, from early pattern recognition to the latest foundation models capable of advanced reasoning, and offer a taxonomy of representative neural architectures, including graph-based and transformer-based methods. Addressing key challenges such as data quality, multimodal integration, and computational scalability, we highlight emerging directions such as synthetic data generation, large-scale pretraining, and few- or zero-shot learning. To foster reproducible research, we also release an open-source repository containing recent papers and their corresponding curated datasets (https://github.com/MINE-Lab-ND/SpectrumML_Survey_Papers). Our survey serves as a roadmap for researchers, guiding progress at the intersection of spectroscopy and AI.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Model-based Adaptation for Visual Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning agents typically face serious performance declines in real-world applications caused by visual distractions. Existing methods rely on fine-tuning the policy's representations with hand-crafted augmentations. In this work, we propose Self-Consistent Model-based Adaptation (SCMA), a novel method that fosters robust adaptation without modifying the policy. By transferring cluttered observations to clean ones with a denoising model, SCMA can mitigate distractions for various policies as a plug-and-play enhancement. To optimize the denoising model in an unsupervised manner, we derive an unsupervised distribution matching objective with a theoretical analysis of its optimality. We further present a practical algorithm to optimize the objective by estimating the distribution of clean observations with a pre-trained world model. Extensive experiments on multiple visual generalization benchmarks and real robot data demonstrate that SCMA effectively boosts performance across various distractions and exhibits better sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>MIR-Bench: Benchmarking LLM's Long-Context Intelligence via Many-Shot In-Context Inductive Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inductive Reasoning (IR), the ability to summarize rules from examples and apply on new ones, has long been viewed as a primal ability for general intelligence and widely studied by cognitive science and AI researchers. Many benchmarks have been proposed to measure such ability for Large Language Models (LLMs); however, they focus on few-shot (usually $&lt;$10) setting and lack evaluation for aggregating many pieces of information from long contexts. On the other hand, the ever-growing context length of LLMs have brought forth the novel paradigm of many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), which addresses new tasks with hundreds to thousands of examples without expensive and inefficient fine-tuning. However, many-shot evaluations are mostly focused on classification (a very limited aspect of IR), and popular long-context LLM tasks such as Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) seldom require complicated intelligence for integrating many pieces of information. To fix the issues from both worlds, we propose MIR-Bench, the first many-shot in-context inductive reasoning benchmark that asks LLM to induce output via input-output examples from underlying functions with diverse data format. Based on MIR-Bench, we study many novel problems for inductive reasoning and many-shot ICL, including robustness against erroneous shots and the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and acquired insightful findings.</description>

      <title>Tradeoffs in Processing Queries and Supporting Updates over an ML-Enhanced R-tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been successfully applied to design various learned database index structures for both the one- and multi-dimensional spaces. Particularly, a class of traditional multi-dimensional indexes has been augmented with ML models to design ML-enhanced variants of their traditional counterparts. This paper focuses on the R-tree multi-dimensional index structure as it is widely used for indexing multi-dimensional data. The R-tree has been augmented with machine learning models to enhance the R-tree performance. The AI+R-tree is an ML-enhanced R-tree index structure that augments a traditional disk-based R-tree with an ML model to enhance the R-tree's query processing performance, mainly, to avoid navigating the overlapping branches of the R-tree that do not yield query results, e.g., in the presence of high-overlap among the rectangles of the R-tree nodes. We investigate the empirical tradeoffs in processing dynamic query workloads and in supporting updates over the AI+R-tree. Particularly, we investigate the impact of the choice of ML models over the AI+R-tree query processing performance. Moreover, we present a case study of designing a custom loss function for a neural network model tailored to the query processing requirements of the AI+R-tree. Furthermore, we present the design tradeoffs for adopting various strategies for supporting dynamic inserts, updates, and deletes with the vision of realizing a mutable AI+R-tree. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the AI+R-tree can enhance the query processing performance of a traditional R-tree for high-overlap range queries by up to 5.4X while achieving up to 99% average query recall.</description>

Abstract: In the analysis of remote healthcare monitoring data, time series representation learning offers substantial value in uncovering deeper patterns of patient behavior, especially given the fine temporal granularity of the data. In this study, we focus on a dataset of home activity records from people living with Dementia. We propose a two-stage self-supervised learning approach. The first stage involves converting time-series activities into text strings, which are then encoded by a fine-tuned language model. In the second stage, these time-series vectors are bi-dimensionalized for applying PageRank method, to analyze latent state transitions to quantitatively assess participants behavioral patterns and identify activity biases. These insights, combined with diagnostic data, aim to support personalized care interventions.</description>

      <title>KGGen: Extracting Knowledge Graphs from Plain Text with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent interest in building foundation models for KGs has highlighted a fundamental challenge: knowledge-graph data is relatively scarce. The best-known KGs are primarily human-labeled, created by pattern-matching, or extracted using early NLP techniques. While human-generated KGs are in short supply, automatically extracted KGs are of questionable quality. We present a solution to this data scarcity problem in the form of a text-to-KG generator (KGGen), a package that uses language models to create high-quality graphs from plaintext. Unlike other KG extractors, KGGen clusters related entities to reduce sparsity in extracted KGs. KGGen is available as a Python library (\texttt{pip install kg-gen}), making it accessible to everyone. Along with KGGen, we release the first benchmark, Measure of of Information in Nodes and Edges (MINE), that tests an extractor's ability to produce a useful KG from plain text. We benchmark our new tool against existing extractors and demonstrate far superior performance.</description>

      <title>Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials are Ready for Solid Ion Conductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of energy storage technology, high-performance solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have become critical for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. These materials require high ionic conductivity, excellent electrochemical stability, and good mechanical properties to meet the demands of electric vehicles and portable electronics. However, traditional methods like density functional theory (DFT) and empirical force fields face challenges such as high computational costs, poor scalability, and limited accuracy across material systems. Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) offer a promising solution with their efficiency and near-DFT-level accuracy.This study systematically evaluates six advanced uMLIP models (MatterSim, MACE, SevenNet, CHGNet, M3GNet, and ORBFF) in terms of energy, forces, thermodynamic properties, elastic moduli, and lithium-ion diffusion behavior. The results show that MatterSim outperforms others in nearly all metrics, particularly in complex material systems, demonstrating superior accuracy and physical consistency. Other models exhibit significant deviations due to issues like energy inconsistency or insufficient training data coverage.Further analysis reveals that MatterSim achieves excellent agreement with reference values in lithium-ion diffusivity calculations, especially at room temperature. Studies on Li3YCl6 and Li6PS5Cl uncover how crystal structure, anion disorder levels, and Na/Li arrangements influence ionic conductivity. Appropriate S/Cl disorder levels and optimized Na/Li arrangements enhance diffusion pathway connectivity, improving overall ionic transport performance.</description>

      <title>On Volume Minimization in Conformal Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the question of volume optimality in split conformal regression, a topic still poorly understood in comparison to coverage control. Using the fact that the calibration step can be seen as an empirical volume minimization problem, we first derive a finite-sample upper-bound on the excess volume loss of the interval returned by the classical split method. This important quantity measures the difference in length between the interval obtained with the split method and the shortest oracle prediction interval. Then, we introduce EffOrt, a methodology that modifies the learning step so that the base prediction function is selected in order to minimize the length of the returned intervals. In particular, our theoretical analysis of the excess volume loss of the prediction sets produced by EffOrt reveals the links between the learning and calibration steps, and notably the impact of the choice of the function class of the base predictor. We also introduce Ad-EffOrt, an extension of the previous method, which produces intervals whose size adapts to the value of the covariate. Finally, we evaluate the empirical performance and the robustness of our methodologies.</description>

      <title>X-Boundary: Establishing Exact Safety Boundary to Shield LLMs from Multi-Turn Jailbreaks without Compromising Usability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid development of safety alignment techniques for LLMs, defending against multi-turn jailbreaks is still a challenging task. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison, revealing that some existing defense methods can improve the robustness of LLMs against multi-turn jailbreaks but compromise usability, i.e., reducing general capabilities or causing the over-refusal problem. From the perspective of mechanism interpretability of LLMs, we discover that these methods fail to establish a boundary that exactly distinguishes safe and harmful feature representations. Therefore, boundary-safe representations close to harmful representations are inevitably disrupted, leading to a decline in usability. To address this issue, we propose X-Boundary to push harmful representations away from boundary-safe representations and obtain an exact distinction boundary. In this way, harmful representations can be precisely erased without disrupting safe ones. Experimental results show that X-Boundary achieves state-of-the-art defense performance against multi-turn jailbreaks, while reducing the over-refusal rate by about 20% and maintaining nearly complete general capability. Furthermore, we theoretically prove and empirically verify that X-Boundary can accelerate the convergence process during training.

      <title>Large Language Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) are widely regarded as the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer to predict masked tokens. By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and promising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM capabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the Learning Coefficient Using Empirical Loss</title>

Abstract: The learning coefficient plays a crucial role in analyzing the performance of information criteria, such as the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and the Widely Applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC), which Sumio Watanabe developed to assess model generalization ability. In regular statistical models, the learning coefficient is given by d/2, where d is the dimension of the parameter space. More generally, it is defined as the absolute value of the pole order of a zeta function derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the prior distribution. However, except for specific cases such as reduced-rank regression, the learning coefficient cannot be derived in a closed form. Watanabe proposed a numerical method to estimate the learning coefficient, which Imai further refined to enhance its convergence properties. These methods utilize the asymptotic behavior of WBIC and have been shown to be statistically consistent as the sample size grows. In this paper, we propose a novel numerical estimation method that fundamentally differs from previous approaches and leverages a new quantity, "Empirical Loss," which was introduced by Watanabe. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits both lower bias and lower variance compared to those of Watanabe and Imai. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis that elucidates why our method outperforms existing techniques and present empirical evidence that supports our findings.</description>

      <title>EmbBERT-Q: Breaking Memory Barriers in Embedded NLP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, setting new standards across a wide range of applications. However, their relevant memory and computational demands make them impractical for deployment on technologically-constrained tiny devices such as wearable devices and Internet-of-Things units. To address this limitation, we introduce EmbBERT-Q, a novel tiny language model specifically designed for tiny devices with stringent memory constraints. EmbBERT-Q achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) accuracy in Natural Language Processing tasks in this scenario, with a total memory footprint (weights and activations) of just 781 kB, representing a 25x reduction in size with respect to SotA models. By combining architectural innovations with hardware-compatible 8-bit quantization, EmbBERT-Q consistently outperforms several baseline models scaled down to a 2 MB memory budget (i.e., the maximum memory typically available in tiny devices), including heavily compressed versions of BERT and MAMBA. Extensive experimental evaluations on both a selected benchmark dataset, TinyNLP, specifically curated to evaluate Tiny Language Models in NLP tasks and real-world scenarios, and the GLUE benchmark, demonstrate EmbBERT-Q ability to deliver competitive accuracy with respect to existing approaches, achieving an unmatched balance between memory and performance. To ensure the complete and immediate reproducibility of all our results, we release all code, scripts, and model checkpoints at https://github.com/RiccardoBravin/tiny-LLM.</description>

      <title>InterGridNet: An Electric Network Frequency Approach for Audio Source Location Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel framework, called InterGridNet, is introduced, leveraging a shallow RawNet model for geolocation classification of Electric Network Frequency (ENF) signatures in the SP Cup 2016 dataset. During data preparation, recordings are sorted into audio and power groups based on inherent characteristics, further divided into 50 Hz and 60 Hz groups via spectrogram analysis. Residual blocks within the classification model extract frame-level embeddings, aiding decision-making through softmax activation. The topology and the hyperparameters of the shallow RawNet are optimized using a Neural Architecture Search. The overall accuracy of InterGridNet in the test recordings is 92%, indicating its effectiveness against the state-of-the-art methods tested in the SP Cup 2016. These findings underscore InterGridNet's effectiveness in accurately classifying audio recordings from diverse power grids, advancing state-of-the-art geolocation estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Improved Online Confidence Bounds for Multinomial Logistic Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an improved online confidence bound for multinomial logistic (MNL) models and apply this result to MNL bandits, achieving variance-dependent optimal regret. Recently, Lee &amp; Oh (2024) established an online confidence bound for MNL models and achieved nearly minimax-optimal regret in MNL bandits. However, their results still depend on the norm-boundedness of the unknown parameter $B$ and the maximum size of possible outcomes $K$. To address this, we first derive an online confidence bound of $O\left(\sqrt{d \log t} + B \right)$, which is a significant improvement over the previous bound of $O (B \sqrt{d} \log t \log K )$ (Lee &amp; Oh, 2024). This is mainly achieved by establishing tighter self-concordant properties of the MNL loss and introducing a novel intermediary term to bound the estimation error. Using this new online confidence bound, we propose a constant-time algorithm, OFU-MNL++, which achieves a variance-dependent regret bound of $O \Big( d \log T \sqrt{ \smash[b]{\sum_{t=1}^T} \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $ for sufficiently large $T$, where $\sigma_t^2$ denotes the variance of the rewards at round $t$, $d$ is the dimension of the contexts, and $T$ is the total number of rounds. Furthermore, we introduce an Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)-based algorithm that achieves an anytime, OFU-MN$^2$L, poly($(B)$)-free regret of $O \Big( d \log (BT) \sqrt{ \smash[b]{\sum_{t=1}^T} \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $.</description>

      <title>DiSciPLE: Learning Interpretable Programs for Scientific Visual Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual data is used in numerous different scientific workflows ranging from remote sensing to ecology. As the amount of observation data increases, the challenge is not just to make accurate predictions but also to understand the underlying mechanisms for those predictions. Good interpretation is important in scientific workflows, as it allows for better decision-making by providing insights into the data. This paper introduces an automatic way of obtaining such interpretable-by-design models, by learning programs that interleave neural networks. We propose DiSciPLE (Discovering Scientific Programs using LLMs and Evolution) an evolutionary algorithm that leverages common sense and prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to create Python programs explaining visual data. Additionally, we propose two improvements: a program critic and a program simplifier to improve our method further to synthesize good programs. On three different real-world problems, DiSciPLE learns state-of-the-art programs on novel tasks with no prior literature. For example, we can learn programs with 35% lower error than the closest non-interpretable baseline for population density estimation.</description>

      <title>Topological Neural Networks over the Air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological neural networks (TNNs) are information processing architectures that model representations from data lying over topological spaces (e.g., simplicial or cell complexes) and allow for decentralized implementation through localized communications over different neighborhoods. Existing TNN architectures have not yet been considered in realistic communication scenarios, where channel effects typically introduce disturbances such as fading and noise. This paper aims to propose a novel TNN design, operating on regular cell complexes, that performs over-the-air computation, incorporating the wireless communication model into its architecture. Specifically, during training and inference, the proposed method considers channel impairments such as fading and noise in the topological convolutional filtering operation, which takes place over different signal orders and neighborhoods. Numerical results illustrate the architecture's robustness to channel impairments during testing and the superior performance with respect to existing architectures, which are either communication-agnostic or graph-based.</description>

      <title>Towards Empowerment Gain through Causal Structure Learning in Model-Based RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL), incorporating causal structures into dynamics models provides agents with a structured understanding of the environments, enabling efficient decision. Empowerment as an intrinsic motivation enhances the ability of agents to actively control their environments by maximizing the mutual information between future states and actions. We posit that empowerment coupled with causal understanding can improve controllability, while enhanced empowerment gain can further facilitate causal reasoning in MBRL. To improve learning efficiency and controllability, we propose a novel framework, Empowerment through Causal Learning (ECL), where an agent with the awareness of causal dynamics models achieves empowerment-driven exploration and optimizes its causal structure for task learning. Specifically, ECL operates by first training a causal dynamics model of the environment based on collected data. We then maximize empowerment under the causal structure for exploration, simultaneously using data gathered through exploration to update causal dynamics model to be more controllable than dense dynamics model without causal structure. In downstream task learning, an intrinsic curiosity reward is included to balance the causality, mitigating overfitting. Importantly, ECL is method-agnostic and is capable of integrating various causal discovery methods. We evaluate ECL combined with 3 causal discovery methods across 6 environments including pixel-based tasks, demonstrating its superior performance compared to other causal MBRL methods, in terms of causal discovery, sample efficiency, and asymptotic performance.</description>

      <title>Causal Information Prioritization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often suffer from sample-inefficiency, resulting from blind exploration strategies that neglect causal relationships among states, actions, and rewards. Although recent causal approaches aim to address this problem, they lack grounded modeling of reward-guided causal understanding of states and actions for goal-orientation, thus impairing learning efficiency. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method named Causal Information Prioritization (CIP) that improves sample efficiency by leveraging factored MDPs to infer causal relationships between different dimensions of states and actions with respect to rewards, enabling the prioritization of causal information. Specifically, CIP identifies and leverages causal relationships between states and rewards to execute counterfactual data augmentation to prioritize high-impact state features under the causal understanding of the environments. Moreover, CIP integrates a causality-aware empowerment learning objective, which significantly enhances the agent's execution of reward-guided actions for more efficient exploration in complex environments. To fully assess the effectiveness of CIP, we conduct extensive experiments across 39 tasks in 5 diverse continuous control environments, encompassing both locomotion and manipulation skills learning with pixel-based and sparse reward settings. Experimental results demonstrate that CIP consistently outperforms existing RL methods across a wide range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Video Soundtrack Generation by Aligning Emotions and Temporal Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce EMSYNC, a video-based symbolic music generation model that aligns music with a video's emotional content and temporal boundaries. It follows a two-stage framework, where a pretrained video emotion classifier extracts emotional features, and a conditional music generator produces MIDI sequences guided by both emotional and temporal cues. We introduce boundary offsets, a novel temporal conditioning mechanism that enables the model to anticipate and align musical chords with scene cuts. Unlike existing models, our approach retains event-based encoding, ensuring fine-grained timing control and expressive musical nuances. We also propose a mapping scheme to bridge the video emotion classifier, which produces discrete emotion categories, with the emotion-conditioned MIDI generator, which operates on continuous-valued valence-arousal inputs. In subjective listening tests, EMSYNC outperforms state-of-the-art models across all subjective metrics, for music theory-aware participants as well as the general listeners.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Reinforcement Learning with Preference Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider combinatorial reinforcement learning with preference feedback, where a learning agent sequentially offers an action--an assortment of multiple items to--a user, whose preference feedback follows a multinomial logistic (MNL) model. This framework allows us to model real-world scenarios, particularly those involving long-term user engagement, such as in recommender systems and online advertising. However, this framework faces two main challenges: (1) the unknown value of each item, unlike traditional MNL bandits that only address single-step preference feedback, and (2) the difficulty of ensuring optimism while maintaining tractable assortment selection in the combinatorial action space with unknown values. In this paper, we assume a contextual MNL preference model, where the mean utilities are linear, and the value of each item is approximated by a general function. We propose an algorithm, MNL-VQL, that addresses these challenges, making it both computationally and statistically efficient. As a special case, for linear MDPs (with the MNL preference feedback), we establish the first regret lower bound in this framework and show that MNL-VQL achieves nearly minimax-optimal regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide statistical guarantees in combinatorial RL with preference feedback.</description>

      <title>Enhancing anomaly detection with topology-aware autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in high-energy physics is essential for identifying new physics beyond the Standard Model. Autoencoders provide a signal-agnostic approach but are limited by the topology of their latent space. This work explores topology-aware autoencoders, embedding phase-space distributions onto compact manifolds that reflect energy-momentum conservation. We construct autoencoders with spherical ($S^n$), product ($S^2 \otimes S^2$), and projective ($\mathbb{RP}^2$) latent spaces and compare their anomaly detection performance against conventional Euclidean embeddings. Our results show that autoencoders with topological priors significantly improve anomaly separation by preserving the global structure of the data manifold and reducing spurious reconstruction errors. Applying our approach to simulated hadronic top-quark decays, we show that latent spaces with appropriate topological constraints enhance sensitivity and robustness in detecting anomalous events. This study establishes topology-aware autoencoders as a powerful tool for unsupervised searches for new physics in particle-collision data.</description>

      <title>Agentic End-to-End De Novo Protein Design for Tailored Dynamics Using a Language Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins are dynamic molecular machines whose biological functions, spanning enzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, and structural adaptation, are intrinsically linked to their motions. Designing proteins with targeted dynamic properties, however, remains a challenge due to the complex, degenerate relationships between sequence, structure, and molecular motion. Here, we introduce VibeGen, a generative AI framework that enables end-to-end de novo protein design conditioned on normal mode vibrations. VibeGen employs an agentic dual-model architecture, comprising a protein designer that generates sequence candidates based on specified vibrational modes and a protein predictor that evaluates their dynamic accuracy. This approach synergizes diversity, accuracy, and novelty during the design process. Via full-atom molecular simulations as direct validation, we demonstrate that the designed proteins accurately reproduce the prescribed normal mode amplitudes across the backbone while adopting various stable, functionally relevant structures. Notably, generated sequences are de novo, exhibiting no significant similarity to natural proteins, thereby expanding the accessible protein space beyond evolutionary constraints. Our work integrates protein dynamics into generative protein design, and establishes a direct, bidirectional link between sequence and vibrational behavior, unlocking new pathways for engineering biomolecules with tailored dynamical and functional properties. This framework holds broad implications for the rational design of flexible enzymes, dynamic scaffolds, and biomaterials, paving the way toward dynamics-informed AI-driven protein engineering.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Camera Bias of Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We empirically investigate the camera bias of person re-identification (ReID) models. Previously, camera-aware methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they are largely confined to training domains of the models. We measure the camera bias of ReID models on unseen domains and reveal that camera bias becomes more pronounced under data distribution shifts. As a debiasing method for unseen domain data, we revisit feature normalization on embedding vectors. While the normalization has been used as a straightforward solution, its underlying causes and broader applicability remain unexplored. We analyze why this simple method is effective at reducing bias and show that it can be applied to detailed bias factors such as low-level image properties and body angle. Furthermore, we validate its generalizability across various models and benchmarks, highlighting its potential as a simple yet effective test-time postprocessing method for ReID. In addition, we explore the inherent risk of camera bias in unsupervised learning of ReID models. The unsupervised models remain highly biased towards camera labels even for seen domain data, indicating substantial room for improvement. Based on observations of the negative impact of camera-biased pseudo labels on training, we suggest simple training strategies to mitigate the bias. By applying these strategies to existing unsupervised learning algorithms, we show that significant performance improvements can be achieved with minor modifications.</description>

      <title>Mapping bathymetry of inland water bodies on the North Slope of Alaska with Landsat using Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The North Slope of Alaska is dominated by small waterbodies that provide critical ecosystem services for local population and wildlife. Detailed information on the depth of the waterbodies is scarce due to the challenges with collecting such information. In this work we have trained a machine learning (Random Forest Regressor) model to predict depth from multispectral Landsat data in waterbodies across the North Slope of Alaska. The greatest challenge is the scarcity of in situ data, which is expensive and difficult to obtain, to train the model. We overcame this challenge by using modeled depth predictions from a prior study as synthetic training data to provide a more diverse training data pool for the Random Forest. The final Random Forest model was more robust than models trained directly on the in situ data and when applied to 208 Landsat 8 scenes from 2016 to 2018 yielded a map with an overall $r^{2}$ value of 0.76 on validation. The final map has been made available through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distribute Active Archive Center (ORNL-DAAC). This map represents a first of its kind regional assessment of waterbody depth with per pixel estimates of depth for the entire North Slope of Alaska.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Reason Causally Like Us? Even Better?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal reasoning is a core component of intelligence. Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating human-like text, raising questions about whether their responses reflect true understanding or statistical patterns. We compared causal reasoning in humans and four LLMs using tasks based on collider graphs, rating the likelihood of a query variable occurring given evidence from other variables. We find that LLMs reason causally along a spectrum from human-like to normative inference, with alignment shifting based on model, context, and task. Overall, GPT-4o and Claude showed the most normative behavior, including "explaining away", whereas Gemini-Pro and GPT-3.5 did not. Although all agents deviated from the expected independence of causes - Claude the least - they exhibited strong associative reasoning and predictive inference when assessing the likelihood of the effect given its causes. These findings underscore the need to assess AI biases as they increasingly assist human decision-making.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solve the Min-Max Mixed-Shelves Picker-Routing Problem via Hierarchical and Parallel Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mixed-Shelves Picker Routing Problem (MSPRP) is a fundamental challenge in warehouse logistics, where pickers must navigate a mixed-shelves environment to retrieve SKUs efficiently. Traditional heuristics and optimization-based approaches struggle with scalability, while recent machine learning methods often rely on sequential decision-making, leading to high solution latency and suboptimal agent coordination. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical and parallel decoding approach for solving the min-max variant of the MSPRP via multi-agent reinforcement learning. While our approach generates a joint distribution over agent actions, allowing for fast decoding and effective picker coordination, our method introduces a sequential action selection to avoid conflicts in the multi-dimensional action space. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in both solution quality and inference speed, particularly for large-scale and out-of-distribution instances. Our code is publicly available at http://github.com/LTluttmann/marl4msprp.</description>

      <title>AdaPTS: Adapting Univariate Foundation Models to Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models (FMs) have shown exceptional performance in univariate time series forecasting tasks. However, several practical challenges persist, including managing intricate dependencies among features and quantifying uncertainty in predictions. This study aims to tackle these critical limitations by introducing adapters; feature-space transformations that facilitate the effective use of pre-trained univariate time series FMs for multivariate tasks. Adapters operate by projecting multivariate inputs into a suitable latent space and applying the FM independently to each dimension. Inspired by the literature on representation learning and partially stochastic Bayesian neural networks, we present a range of adapters and optimization/inference strategies. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the efficacy of adapters, demonstrating substantial enhancements in forecasting accuracy and uncertainty quantification compared to baseline methods. Our framework, AdaPTS, positions adapters as a modular, scalable, and effective solution for leveraging time series FMs in multivariate contexts, thereby promoting their wider adoption in real-world applications. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/AdaPTS.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models and Synthetic Data for Monitoring Dataset Mentions in Research Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking how data is mentioned and used in research papers provides critical insights for improving data discoverability, quality, and production. However, manually identifying and classifying dataset mentions across vast academic literature is resource-intensive and not scalable. This paper presents a machine learning framework that automates dataset mention detection across research domains by leveraging large language models (LLMs), synthetic data, and a two-stage fine-tuning process. We employ zero-shot extraction from research papers, an LLM-as-a-Judge for quality assessment, and a reasoning agent for refinement to generate a weakly supervised synthetic dataset. The Phi-3.5-mini instruct model is pre-fine-tuned on this dataset, followed by fine-tuning on a manually annotated subset. At inference, a ModernBERT-based classifier efficiently filters dataset mentions, reducing computational overhead while maintaining high recall. Evaluated on a held-out manually annotated sample, our fine-tuned model outperforms NuExtract-v1.5 and GLiNER-large-v2.1 in dataset extraction accuracy. Our results highlight how LLM-generated synthetic data can effectively address training data scarcity, improving generalization in low-resource settings. This framework offers a pathway toward scalable monitoring of dataset usage, enhancing transparency, and supporting researchers, funders, and policymakers in identifying data gaps and strengthening data accessibility for informed decision-making.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered Preference Elicitation in Combinatorial Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the potential of large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans to simplify preference elicitation (PE) in combinatorial assignment. While traditional PE methods rely on iterative queries to capture preferences, LLMs offer a one-shot alternative with reduced human effort. We propose a framework for LLM proxies that can work in tandem with SOTA ML-powered preference elicitation schemes. Our framework handles the novel challenges introduced by LLMs, such as response variability and increased computational costs. We experimentally evaluate the efficiency of LLM proxies against human queries in the well-studied course allocation domain, and we investigate the model capabilities required for success. We find that our approach improves allocative efficiency by up to 20%, and these results are robust across different LLMs and to differences in quality and accuracy of reporting.</description>

      <title>Generalised Parallel Tempering: Flexible Replica Exchange via Flows and Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel Tempering (PT) is a classical MCMC algorithm designed for leveraging parallel computation to sample efficiently from high-dimensional, multimodal or otherwise complex distributions via annealing. One limitation of the standard formulation of PT is the growth of computational resources required to generate high-quality samples, as measured by effective sample size or round trip rate, for increasingly challenging distributions. To address this issue, we propose the framework: Generalised Parallel Tempering (GePT) which allows for the incorporation of recent advances in modern generative modelling, such as normalising flows and diffusion models, within Parallel Tempering, while maintaining the same theoretical guarantees as MCMC-based methods. For instance, we show that this allows us to utilise diffusion models in a parallelised manner, bypassing the usual computational cost of a large number of steps to generate quality samples. Further, we empirically demonstrate that GePT can improve sample quality and reduce the growth of computational resources required to handle complex distributions over the classical algorithm.</description>

      <title>STAR: Spectral Truncation and Rescale for Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging is an efficient way of obtaining a multi-task model from several pretrained models without further fine-tuning, and it has gained attention in various domains, including natural language processing (NLP). Despite the efficiency, a key challenge in model merging is the seemingly inevitable decrease in task performance as the number of models increases. In this paper, we propose $\mathbf{S}$pectral $\mathbf{T}$runcation $\mathbf{A}$nd $\mathbf{R}$escale (STAR) that aims at mitigating ``merging conflicts'' by truncating small components in the respective spectral spaces, which is followed by an automatic parameter rescaling scheme to retain the nuclear norm of the original matrix. STAR requires no additional inference on original training data and is robust to hyperparamater choice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STAR through extensive model merging cases on diverse NLP tasks. Specifically, STAR works robustly across varying model sizes, and can outperform baselines by 4.2$\%$ when merging 12 models on Flan-T5. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/IBM/STAR.</description>

      <title>Assortment Optimization for Patient-Provider Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rising provider turnover forces healthcare administrators to frequently rematch patients to available providers, which can be cumbersome and labor-intensive. To reduce the burden of rematching, we study algorithms for matching patients and providers through assortment optimization. We develop a patient-provider matching model in which we simultaneously offer each patient a menu of providers, and patients subsequently respond and select providers. By offering assortments upfront, administrators can balance logistical ease and patient autonomy. We study policies for assortment optimization and characterize their performance under different problem settings. We demonstrate that the selection of assortment policy is highly dependent on problem specifics and, in particular, on a patient's willingness to match and the ratio between patients and providers. On real-world data, we show that our best policy can improve match quality by 13% over a greedy solution by tailoring assortment sizes based on patient characteristics. We conclude with recommendations for running a real-world patient-provider matching system inspired by our results.</description>

We train further models to predict $a_p \bmod 2$ from $a_q \bmod 2$, and cross-analysis such as $a_p \bmod 2$ from $a_q$. Our experiments reveal that these models achieve high accuracy, even in the absence of explicit number-theoretic tools like functional equations of $L$-functions.

      <title>Enhancing Multilingual LLM Pretraining with Model-Based Data Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset curation has become a basis for strong large language model (LLM) performance. While various rule-based filtering heuristics exist for English and multilingual datasets, model-based filtering techniques have primarily focused on English. To address the disparity stemming from limited research on non-English languages, we propose a model-based filtering framework for multilingual datasets that aims to identify a diverse set of structured and knowledge-rich samples. Our approach emphasizes transparency, simplicity, and efficiency, leveraging Transformer- and FastText-based classifiers to ensure the broad accessibility of our technique and data. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the FineWeb-2 web crawl dataset across diverse language families, scripts, and resource availability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Training a 1B-parameter Llama model for 70B and 119B tokens, our approach can match the baseline MMLU score with as little as 15% of the training tokens, while also improving across other benchmarks. These findings provide strong evidence for the generalizability of our approach to other languages. As a result, we extend our framework to 20 languages for which we release the refined pretraining datasets.</description>

      <title>BeamDojo: Learning Agile Humanoid Locomotion on Sparse Footholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traversing risky terrains with sparse footholds poses a significant challenge for humanoid robots, requiring precise foot placements and stable locomotion. Existing approaches designed for quadrupedal robots often fail to generalize to humanoid robots due to differences in foot geometry and unstable morphology, while learning-based approaches for humanoid locomotion still face great challenges on complex terrains due to sparse foothold reward signals and inefficient learning processes. To address these challenges, we introduce BeamDojo, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed for enabling agile humanoid locomotion on sparse footholds. BeamDojo begins by introducing a sampling-based foothold reward tailored for polygonal feet, along with a double critic to balancing the learning process between dense locomotion rewards and sparse foothold rewards. To encourage sufficient trail-and-error exploration, BeamDojo incorporates a two-stage RL approach: the first stage relaxes the terrain dynamics by training the humanoid on flat terrain while providing it with task terrain perceptive observations, and the second stage fine-tunes the policy on the actual task terrain. Moreover, we implement a onboard LiDAR-based elevation map to enable real-world deployment. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that BeamDojo achieves efficient learning in simulation and enables agile locomotion with precise foot placement on sparse footholds in the real world, maintaining a high success rate even under significant external disturbances.</description>

      <title>OWLS: Scaling Laws for Multilingual Speech Recognition and Translation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws offer valuable insights for designing robust sequence processing architectures. While these laws have been extensively characterized in other modalities, their behavior in speech remains comparatively underexplored. In this work, we introduce OWLS, an open-access, reproducible suite of multilingual speech recognition and translation models spanning 0.25B to 18B parameters, with the 18B version being the largest speech model, to the best of our knowledge. OWLS leverages up to 360K hours of public speech data across 150 languages, enabling a systematic investigation into how data, model, and compute scaling each influence performance in multilingual speech tasks. We use OWLS to derive neural scaling laws, showing how final performance can be reliably predicted when scaling. One of our key findings is that scaling enhances performance on low-resource languages/dialects, helping to mitigate bias and improve the accessibility of speech technologies. Finally, we show how OWLS can be used to power new research directions by discovering emergent abilities in large-scale speech models. Model checkpoints will be released on https://huggingface.co/collections/espnet/owls-scaling-laws-for-speech-recognition-and-translation-67ab7f991c194065f057ce8d for future studies.</description>

      <title>Text-guided Sparse Voxel Pruning for Efficient 3D Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-level convolution architecture for 3D visual grounding. Conventional methods are difficult to meet the requirements of real-time inference due to the two-stage or point-based architecture. Inspired by the success of multi-level fully sparse convolutional architecture in 3D object detection, we aim to build a new 3D visual grounding framework following this technical route. However, as in 3D visual grounding task the 3D scene representation should be deeply interacted with text features, sparse convolution-based architecture is inefficient for this interaction due to the large amount of voxel features. To this end, we propose text-guided pruning (TGP) and completion-based addition (CBA) to deeply fuse 3D scene representation and text features in an efficient way by gradual region pruning and target completion. Specifically, TGP iteratively sparsifies the 3D scene representation and thus efficiently interacts the voxel features with text features by cross-attention. To mitigate the affect of pruning on delicate geometric information, CBA adaptively fixes the over-pruned region by voxel completion with negligible computational overhead. Compared with previous single-stage methods, our method achieves top inference speed and surpasses previous fastest method by 100\% FPS. Our method also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy even compared with two-stage methods, with $+1.13$ lead of Acc@0.5 on ScanRefer, and $+2.6$ and $+3.2$ leads on NR3D and SR3D respectively.

      <title>Training Neural Networks on Data Sources with Unknown Reliability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02895v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When data is generated by multiple sources, conventional training methods update models assuming equal reliability for each source and do not consider their individual data quality. However, in many applications, sources have varied levels of reliability that can have negative effects on the performance of a neural network. A key issue is that often the quality of the data for individual sources is not known during training. Previous methods for training models in the presence of noisy data do not make use of the additional information that the source label can provide. Focusing on supervised learning, we aim to train neural networks on each data source for a number of steps proportional to the source's estimated reliability by using a dynamic re-weighting strategy motivated by likelihood tempering. This way, we allow training on all sources during the warm-up and reduce learning on less reliable sources during the final training stages, when it has been shown that models overfit to noise. We show through diverse experiments that this can significantly improve model performance when trained on mixtures of reliable and unreliable data sources, and maintain performance when models are trained on reliable sources only.</description>

      <title>Learning to Decouple Complex Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complex system with cluttered observations may be a coupled mixture of multiple simple sub-systems corresponding to latent entities. Such sub-systems may hold distinct dynamics in the continuous-time domain; therein, complicated interactions between sub-systems also evolve over time. This setting is fairly common in the real world but has been less considered. In this paper, we propose a sequential learning approach under this setting by decoupling a complex system for handling irregularly sampled and cluttered sequential observations. Such decoupling brings about not only subsystems describing the dynamics of each latent entity but also a meta-system capturing the interaction between entities over time. Specifically, we argue that the meta-system evolving within a simplex is governed by projected differential equations (ProjDEs). We further analyze and provide neural-friendly projection operators in the context of Bregman divergence. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show the advantages of our approach when facing complex and cluttered sequential data compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>VT-GAN: Cooperative Tabular Data Synthesis using Vertical Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the application of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) to generate synthetic tabular data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). VFL is a collaborative approach to train machine learning models among distinct tabular data holders, such as financial institutions, who possess disjoint features for the same group of customers. In this paper we introduce the VT-GAN framework, Vertical federated Tabular GAN, and demonstrate that VFL can be successfully used to implement GANs for distributed tabular data in privacy-preserving manner, with performance close to centralized GANs that assume shared data. We make design choices with respect to the distribution of GAN generator and discriminator models and introduce a training-with-shuffling technique so that no party can reconstruct training data from the GAN conditional vector. The paper presents (1) an implementation of VT-GAN, (2) a detailed quality evaluation of the VT-GAN-generated synthetic data, (3) an overall scalability examination of VT-GAN framework, (4) a security analysis on VT-GAN's robustness against Membership Inference Attack with different settings of Differential Privacy, for a range of datasets with diverse distribution characteristics. Our results demonstrate that VT-GAN can consistently generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data of comparable quality to that generated by a centralized GAN algorithm. The difference in machine learning utility can be as low as 2.7%, even under extremely imbalanced data distributions across clients or with different numbers of clients.</description>

      <title>Do PAC-Learners Learn the Marginal Distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of PAC Learning asserts that learnability of a concept class $H$ is equivalent to the $\textit{uniform convergence}$ of empirical error in $H$ to its mean, or equivalently, to the problem of $\textit{density estimation}$, learnability of the underlying marginal distribution with respect to events in $H$. This seminal equivalence relies strongly on PAC learning's `distribution-free' assumption, that the adversary may choose any marginal distribution over data. Unfortunately, the distribution-free model is known to be overly adversarial in practice, failing to predict the success of modern machine learning algorithms, but without the Fundamental Theorem our theoretical understanding of learning under distributional constraints remains highly limited.
  In this work, we revisit the connection between PAC learning, uniform convergence, and density estimation beyond the distribution-free setting when the adversary is restricted to choosing a marginal distribution from a known family $\mathscr{P}$. We prove that while the traditional Fundamental Theorem indeed fails, a finer-grained connection between the three fundamental notions continues to hold:
  1. PAC-Learning is strictly sandwiched between two refined models of density estimation, both equivalent to standard density estimation in the distribution-free case, differing only in whether the learner $\textit{knows}$ the set of well-estimated events in $H$.
  2. Under reasonable assumptions on $H$ and $\mathscr{P}$, density estimation is equivalent to \emph{uniform estimation}, a relaxation of uniform convergence allowing non-empirical estimators.
  Together, our results give a clearer picture of how the Fundamental Theorem extends beyond the distribution-free setting and shed new light on the classically challenging problem of learning under arbitrary distributional assumptions.</description>

      <title>Task Aware Dreamer for Task Generalization in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05092v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing goal of reinforcement learning is to acquire agents that can learn on training tasks and generalize well on unseen tasks that may share a similar dynamic but with different reward functions. The ability to generalize across tasks is important as it determines an agent's adaptability to real-world scenarios where reward mechanisms might vary. In this work, we first show that training a general world model can utilize similar structures in these tasks and help train more generalizable agents. Extending world models into the task generalization setting, we introduce a novel method named Task Aware Dreamer (TAD), which integrates reward-informed features to identify consistent latent characteristics across tasks. Within TAD, we compute the variational lower bound of sample data log-likelihood, which introduces a new term designed to differentiate tasks using their states, as the optimization objective of our reward-informed world models. To demonstrate the advantages of the reward-informed policy in TAD, we introduce a new metric called Task Distribution Relevance (TDR) which quantitatively measures the relevance of different tasks. For tasks exhibiting a high TDR, i.e., the tasks differ significantly, we illustrate that Markovian policies struggle to distinguish them, thus it is necessary to utilize reward-informed policies in TAD. Extensive experiments in both image-based and state-based tasks show that TAD can significantly improve the performance of handling different tasks simultaneously, especially for those with high TDR, and display a strong generalization ability to unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>SDC-HSDD-NDSA: Structure Detecting Cluster by Hierarchical Secondary Directed Differential with Normalized Density and Self-Adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00677v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density-based clustering is the most popular clustering algorithm since it can identify clusters of arbitrary shape as long as they are separated by low-density regions. However, a high-density region that is not separated by low-density ones might also have different structures belonging to multiple clusters. As far as we know, all previous density-based clustering algorithms fail to detect such structures. In this paper, we provide a novel density-based clustering scheme to address this problem. It is the rst clustering algorithm that can detect meticulous structures in a high-density region that is not separated by low-density ones and thus extends the range of applications of clustering. The algorithm employs secondary directed differential, hierarchy, normalized density, as well as the self-adaption coefficient, called Structure Detecting Cluster by Hierarchical Secondary Directed Differential with Normalized Density and Self-Adaption, dubbed SDC-HSDD-NDSA. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets are implemented to verify the effectiveness, robustness, and granularity independence of the algorithm, and the scheme is compared to unsupervised schemes in the Python package Scikit-learn. Results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms previous ones in many situations, especially significantly when clusters have regular internal structures. For example, averaging over the eight noiseless synthetic datasets with structures employing ARI and NMI criteria, previous algorithms obtain scores below 0.6 and 0.7, while the presented algorithm obtains scores higher than 0.9 and 0.95, respectively.</description>

      <title>Universal Sharpness Dynamics in Neural Network Training: Fixed Point Analysis, Edge of Stability, and Route to Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gradient descent dynamics of neural networks, the top eigenvalue of the loss Hessian (sharpness) displays a variety of robust phenomena throughout training. This includes early time regimes where the sharpness may decrease during early periods of training (sharpness reduction), and later time behavior such as progressive sharpening and edge of stability. We demonstrate that a simple $2$-layer linear network (UV model) trained on a single training example exhibits all of the essential sharpness phenomenology observed in real-world scenarios. By analyzing the structure of dynamical fixed points in function space and the vector field of function updates, we uncover the underlying mechanisms behind these sharpness trends. Our analysis reveals (i) the mechanism behind early sharpness reduction and progressive sharpening, (ii) the required conditions for edge of stability, (iii) the crucial role of initialization and parameterization, and (iv) a period-doubling route to chaos on the edge of stability manifold as learning rate is increased. Finally, we demonstrate that various predictions from this simplified model generalize to real-world scenarios and discuss its limitations.</description>

      <title>Learning a Diffusion Model Policy from Rewards via Q-Score Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11752v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become a popular choice for representing actor policies in behavior cloning and offline reinforcement learning. This is due to their natural ability to optimize an expressive class of distributions over a continuous space. However, previous works fail to exploit the score-based structure of diffusion models, and instead utilize a simple behavior cloning term to train the actor, limiting their ability in the actor-critic setting. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework linking the structure of diffusion model policies to a learned Q-function, by linking the structure between the score of the policy to the action gradient of the Q-function. We focus on off-policy reinforcement learning and propose a new policy update method from this theory, which we denote Q-score matching. Notably, this algorithm only needs to differentiate through the denoising model rather than the entire diffusion model evaluation, and converged policies through Q-score matching are implicitly multi-modal and explorative in continuous domains. We conduct experiments in simulated environments to demonstrate the viability of our proposed method and compare to popular baselines.

      <title>Is Deep Learning finally better than Decision Trees on Tabular Data?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular data is a ubiquitous data modality due to its versatility and ease of use in many real-world applications. The predominant heuristics for handling classification tasks on tabular data rely on classical machine learning techniques, as the superiority of deep learning models has not yet been demonstrated. This raises the question of whether new deep learning paradigms can surpass classical approaches. Recent studies on tabular data offer a unique perspective on the limitations of neural networks in this domain and highlight the superiority of gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs) in terms of scalability and robustness across various datasets. However, novel foundation models have not been thoroughly assessed regarding quality or fairly compared to existing methods for tabular classification. Our study categorizes ten state-of-the-art neural models based on their underlying learning paradigm, demonstrating specifically that meta-learned foundation models outperform GBDTs in small data regimes. Although dataset-specific neural networks generally outperform LLM-based tabular classifiers, they are surpassed by an AutoML library which exhibits the best performance but at the cost of higher computational demands.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Explanations Through Probabilistic Self-Explainable Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lack of transparency of Deep Neural Networks continues to be a limitation that severely undermines their reliability and usage in high-stakes applications. Promising approaches to overcome such limitations are Prototype-Based Self-Explainable Neural Networks (PSENNs), whose predictions rely on the similarity between the input at hand and a set of prototypical representations of the output classes, offering therefore a deep, yet transparent-by-design, architecture. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic reformulation of PSENNs, called Prob-PSENN, which replaces point estimates for the prototypes with probability distributions over their values. This provides not only a more flexible framework for an end-to-end learning of prototypes, but can also capture the explanatory uncertainty of the model, which is a missing feature in previous approaches. In addition, since the prototypes determine both the explanation and the prediction, Prob-PSENNs allow us to detect when the model is making uninformed or uncertain predictions, and to obtain valid explanations for them. Our experiments demonstrate that Prob-PSENNs provide more meaningful and robust explanations than their non-probabilistic counterparts, while remaining competitive in terms of predictive performance, thus enhancing the explainability and reliability of the models.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Empirical Machine Unlearning Evaluation: A Cryptographic Game Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning updates machine learning models to remove information from specific training samples, complying with data protection regulations that allow individuals to request the removal of their personal data. Despite the recent development of numerous unlearning algorithms, reliable evaluation of these algorithms remains an open research question. In this work, we focus on membership inference attack (MIA) based evaluation, one of the most common approaches for evaluating unlearning algorithms, and address various pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics lacking theoretical understanding and reliability. Specifically, by modeling the proposed evaluation process as a \emph{cryptographic game} between unlearning algorithms and MIA adversaries, the naturally-induced evaluation metric measures the data removal efficacy of unlearning algorithms and enjoys provable guarantees that existing evaluation metrics fail to satisfy. Furthermore, we propose a practical and efficient approximation of the induced evaluation metric and demonstrate its effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. Overall, this work presents a novel and reliable approach to empirically evaluating unlearning algorithms, paving the way for the development of more effective unlearning techniques.</description>

Abstract: Regional socioeconomic indicators are critical across various domains, yet their acquisition can be costly. Inferring global socioeconomic indicators from a limited number of regional samples is essential for enhancing management and sustainability in urban areas and human settlements. Current inference methods typically rely on spatial interpolation based on the assumption of spatial continuity, which does not adequately address the complex variations present within regional spaces. In this paper, we present GeoHG, the first space-aware socioeconomic indicator inference method that utilizes a heterogeneous graph-based structure to represent geospace for non-continuous inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoHG in comparison to existing methods, achieving an $R^2$ score exceeding 0.8 under extreme data scarcity with a masked ratio of 95\%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) refers to the phenomenon that performance remains consistent for linearly interpolated models in the parameter space. For independently optimized model pairs from different random initializations, achieving LMC is considered crucial for understanding the stable success of the non-convex optimization in modern machine learning models and for facilitating practical parameter-based operations such as model merging. While LMC has been achieved for neural networks by considering the permutation invariance of neurons in each hidden layer, its attainment for other models remains an open question. In this paper, we first achieve LMC for soft tree ensembles, which are tree-based differentiable models extensively used in practice. We show the necessity of incorporating two invariances: subtree flip invariance and splitting order invariance, which do not exist in neural networks but are inherent to tree architectures, in addition to permutation invariance of trees. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is even possible to exclude such additional invariances while keeping LMC by designing decision list-based tree architectures, where such invariances do not exist by definition. Our findings indicate the significance of accounting for architecture-specific invariances in achieving LMC.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Clustered Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL), which is a decentralized machine learning (ML) approach, often incorporates differential privacy (DP) to provide rigorous data privacy guarantees. Previous works attempted to address high structured data heterogeneity in vanilla FL settings through clustering clients (a.k.a clustered FL), but these methods remain sensitive and prone to errors, further exacerbated by the DP noise. This vulnerability makes the previous methods inappropriate for differentially private FL (DPFL) settings with structured data heterogeneity. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm for differentially private clustered FL, which is robust to the DP noise in the system and identifies the underlying clients' clusters correctly. To this end, we propose to cluster clients based on both their model updates and training loss values. Furthermore, for clustering clients' model updates at the end of the first round, our proposed approach addresses the server's uncertainties by employing large batch sizes as well as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to reduce the impact of DP and stochastic noise and avoid potential clustering errors. This idea is efficient especially in privacy-sensitive scenarios with more DP noise. We provide theoretical analysis to justify our approach and evaluate it across diverse data distributions and privacy budgets. Our experimental results show its effectiveness in addressing large structured data heterogeneity in DPFL.</description>

Abstract: High utility and rigorous data privacy are of the main goals of a federated learning (FL) system, which learns a model from the data distributed among some clients. The latter has been tried to achieve by using differential privacy in FL (DPFL). There is often heterogeneity in clients privacy requirements, and existing DPFL works either assume uniform privacy requirements for clients or are not applicable when server is not fully trusted (our setting). Furthermore, there is often heterogeneity in batch and/or dataset size of clients, which as shown, results in extra variation in the DP noise level across clients model updates. With these sources of heterogeneity, straightforward aggregation strategies, e.g., assigning clients aggregation weights proportional to their privacy parameters will lead to lower utility. We propose Robust-HDP, which efficiently estimates the true noise level in clients model updates and reduces the noise-level in the aggregated model updates considerably. Robust-HDP improves utility and convergence speed, while being safe to the clients that may maliciously send falsified privacy parameter to server. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets and our theoretical analysis confirm the effectiveness of Robust-HDP. Our code can be found here.</description>

      <title>Verbalized Machine Learning: Revisiting Machine Learning with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the progress made by large language models (LLMs), we introduce the framework of verbalized machine learning (VML). In contrast to conventional machine learning (ML) models that are typically optimized over a continuous parameter space, VML constrains the parameter space to be human-interpretable natural language. Such a constraint leads to a new perspective of function approximation, where an LLM with a text prompt can be viewed as a function parameterized by the text prompt. Guided by this perspective, we revisit classical ML problems, such as regression and classification, and find that these problems can be solved by an LLM-parameterized learner and optimizer. The major advantages of VML include (1) easy encoding of inductive bias: prior knowledge about the problem and hypothesis class can be encoded in natural language and fed into the LLM-parameterized learner; (2) automatic model class selection: the optimizer can automatically select a model class based on data and verbalized prior knowledge, and it can update the model class during training; and (3) interpretable learner updates: the LLM-parameterized optimizer can provide explanations for why an update is performed. We empirically verify the effectiveness of VML, and hope that VML can serve as a stepping stone to stronger interpretability.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Model-Enabled Low-Latency Semantic Communication in the Presence of Semantic Ambiguities and Wireless Channel Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06644v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based Semantic Communications (SemCom) is becoming critical to maximize overall efficiency of communication networks. Nevertheless, SemCom is sensitive to wireless channel uncertainties, source outliers, and suffer from poor generalization bottlenecks. To address the mentioned challenges, this paper develops a latent diffusion model-enabled SemCom system with three key contributions, i.e., i) to handle potential outliers in the source data, semantic errors obtained by projected gradient descent based on the vulnerabilities of DL models, are utilized to update the parameters and obtain an outlier-robust encoder, ii) a lightweight single-layer latent space transformation adapter completes one-shot learning at the transmitter and is placed before the decoder at the receiver, enabling adaptation for out-of-distribution data and enhancing human-perceptual quality, and iii) an end-to-end consistency distillation (EECD) strategy is used to distill the diffusion models trained in latent space, enabling deterministic single or few-step low-latency denoising in various noisy channels while maintaining high semantic quality. Extensive numerical experiments across different datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SemCom system, consistently proving its robustness to outliers, the capability to transmit data with unknown distributions, and the ability to perform real-time channel denoising tasks while preserving high human perceptual quality, outperforming the existing denoising approaches in semantic metrics such as multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) and learned perceptual image path similarity (LPIPS).</description>

      <title>A Critical Look At Tokenwise Reward-Guided Text Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be improved by aligning with human preferences through fine-tuning -- the so-called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, the cost of fine-tuning an LLM is prohibitive for many users. Due to their ability to bypass LLM fine-tuning, prediction-time tokenwise reward-guided text generation (RGTG) methods have recently been proposed. They use a reward model trained on full sequences to score partial sequences during decoding in a bid to steer the generation towards sequences with high rewards. However, these methods have so far been only heuristically motivated and poorly analyzed. In this work, we show that reward models trained on full sequences are not compatible with scoring partial sequences. To alleviate this issue, we propose to train a Bradley-Terry reward model on partial sequences explicitly, and autoregressively sample from the implied tokenwise policy during decoding time. We study the properties of this reward model and the resulting policy: we show that this policy is proportional to the ratio of two distinct RLHF policies. Our simple approach outperforms previous RGTG methods and performs similarly to strong offline baselines without large-scale LLM finetuning.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Prototypes for Imbalanced Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have been shown to leak private information from their training datasets. Differential Privacy (DP), typically implemented through the differential private stochastic gradient descent algorithm (DP-SGD), has become the standard solution to bound leakage from the models. Despite recent improvements, DP-SGD-based approaches for private learning still usually struggle in the high privacy ($\varepsilon\le1)$ and low data regimes, and when the private training datasets are imbalanced. To overcome these limitations, we propose Differentially Private Prototype Learning (DPPL) as a new paradigm for private transfer learning. DPPL leverages publicly pre-trained encoders to extract features from private data and generates DP prototypes that represent each private class in the embedding space and can be publicly released for inference. Since our DP prototypes can be obtained from only a few private training data points and without iterative noise addition, they offer high-utility predictions and strong privacy guarantees even under the notion of \textit{pure DP}. We additionally show that privacy-utility trade-offs can be further improved when leveraging the public data beyond pre-training of the encoder: in particular, we can privately sample our DP prototypes from the publicly available data points used to train the encoder. Our experimental evaluation with four state-of-the-art encoders, four vision datasets, and under different data and imbalancedness regimes demonstrate DPPL's high performance under strong privacy guarantees in challenging private learning setups</description>

      <title>RASPNet: A Benchmark Dataset for Radar Adaptive Signal Processing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a large-scale dataset for radar adaptive signal processing (RASP) applications to support the development of data-driven models within the adaptive radar community. The dataset, RASPNet, exceeds 16 TB in size and comprises 100 realistic scenarios compiled over a variety of topographies and land types from across the contiguous United States. For each scenario, RASPNet consists of 10,000 clutter realizations from an airborne radar setting, which can be used to benchmark radar and complex-valued learning algorithms. RASPNet intends to fill a prominent gap in the availability of a large-scale, realistic dataset that standardizes the evaluation of adaptive radar processing techniques and complex-valued neural networks. We outline its construction, organization, and several applications, including a transfer learning example to demonstrate how RASPNet can be used for realistic adaptive radar processing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Predictive Coding Networks -- Made Simple</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problems of efficiency and scalability for predictive coding networks (PCNs) in machine learning. To do so, we propose a library, called PCX, that focuses on performance and simplicity, and use it to implement a large set of standard benchmarks for the community to use for their experiments. As most works in the field propose their own tasks and architectures, do not compare one against each other, and focus on small-scale tasks, a simple and fast open-source library and a comprehensive set of benchmarks would address all these concerns. Then, we perform extensive tests on such benchmarks using both existing algorithms for PCNs, as well as adaptations of other methods popular in the bio-plausible deep learning community. All this has allowed us to (i) test architectures much larger than commonly used in the literature, on more complex datasets; (ii)~reach new state-of-the-art results in all of the tasks and datasets provided; (iii)~clearly highlight what the current limitations of PCNs are, allowing us to state important future research directions. With the hope of galvanizing community efforts towards one of the main open problems in the field, scalability, we release code, tests, and benchmarks.

      <title>Abstraction Alignment: Comparing Model-Learned and Human-Encoded Conceptual Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While interpretability methods identify a model's learned concepts, they overlook the relationships between concepts that make up its abstractions and inform its ability to generalize to new data. To assess whether models' have learned human-aligned abstractions, we introduce abstraction alignment, a methodology to compare model behavior against formal human knowledge. Abstraction alignment externalizes domain-specific human knowledge as an abstraction graph, a set of pertinent concepts spanning levels of abstraction. Using the abstraction graph as a ground truth, abstraction alignment measures the alignment of a model's behavior by determining how much of its uncertainty is accounted for by the human abstractions. By aggregating abstraction alignment across entire datasets, users can test alignment hypotheses, such as which human concepts the model has learned and where misalignments recur. In evaluations with experts, abstraction alignment differentiates seemingly similar errors, improves the verbosity of existing model-quality metrics, and uncovers improvements to current human abstractions.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based Graph Neural Networks for Battery Range Prediction in AIoT Battery-Swap Services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of the sharing economy has gained broad recognition, and within this context, Sharing E-Bike Battery (SEB) have emerged as a focal point of societal interest. Despite the popularity, a notable discrepancy remains between user expectations regarding the remaining battery range of SEBs and the reality, leading to a pronounced inclination among users to find an available SEB during emergency situations. In response to this challenge, the integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and battery-swap services has surfaced as a viable solution. In this paper, we propose a novel structural Transformer-based model, referred to as the SEB-Transformer, designed specifically for predicting the battery range of SEBs. The scenario is conceptualized as a dynamic heterogeneous graph that encapsulates the interactions between users and bicycles, providing a comprehensive framework for analysis. Furthermore, we incorporate the graph structure into the SEB-Transformer to facilitate the estimation of the remaining e-bike battery range, in conjunction with mean structural similarity, enhancing the prediction accuracy. By employing the predictions made by our model, we are able to dynamically adjust the optimal cycling routes for users in real-time, while also considering the strategic locations of charging stations, thereby optimizing the user experience. Empirically our results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model against nine competitive baselines. These innovations, powered by AIoT, not only bridge the gap between user expectations and the physical limitations of battery range but also significantly improve the operational efficiency and sustainability of SEB services. Through these advancements, the shared electric bicycle ecosystem is evolving, making strides towards a more reliable, user-friendly, and sustainable mode of transportation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Semi-Gradient Descent for Learning Mean Field Games with Population-Aware Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) model interactions in large-population multi-agent systems through population distributions. Traditional learning methods for MFGs are based on fixed-point iteration (FPI), where policy updates and induced population distributions are computed separately and sequentially. However, FPI-type methods may suffer from inefficiency and instability due to potential oscillations caused by this forward-backward procedure. In this work, we propose a novel perspective that treats the policy and population as a unified parameter controlling the game dynamics. By applying stochastic parameter approximation to this unified parameter, we develop SemiSGD, a simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-type method, where an agent updates its policy and population estimates simultaneously and fully asynchronously. Building on this perspective, we further apply linear function approximation (LFA) to the unified parameter, resulting in the first population-aware LFA (PA-LFA) for learning MFGs on continuous state-action spaces. A comprehensive finite-time convergence analysis is provided for SemiSGD with PA-LFA, including its convergence to the equilibrium for linear MFGs -- a class of MFGs with a linear structure concerning the population -- under the standard contractivity condition, and to a neighborhood of the equilibrium under a more practical condition. We also characterize the approximation error for non-linear MFGs. We validate our theoretical findings with six experiments on three MFGs.</description>

      <title>Error-controlled non-additive interaction discovery in machine learning models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are powerful tools for detecting complex patterns within data, yet their "black box" nature limits their interpretability, hindering their use in critical domains like healthcare and finance. To address this challenge, interpretable ML methods have been developed to explain how features influence model predictions. However, these methods often focus on univariate feature importance, overlooking the complex interactions between features that ML models are capable of capturing. Recognizing this limitation, recent efforts have aimed to extend these methods to discover feature interactions, but existing approaches struggle with robustness and error control, especially under data perturbations. In this study, we introduce Diamond, a novel method for trustworthy feature interaction discovery. Diamond uniquely integrates the model-X knockoffs framework to control the false discovery rate (FDR), ensuring that the proportion of falsely discovered interactions remains low. A key innovation in Diamond is its non-additivity distillation procedure, which refines existing interaction importance measures to distill non-additive interaction effects, ensuring that FDR control is maintained. This approach addresses the limitations of off-the-shelf interaction measures, which, when used naively, can lead to inaccurate discoveries. Diamond's applicability spans a wide range of ML models, including deep neural networks, transformer models, tree-based models, and factorization-based models. Our empirical evaluations on both simulated and real datasets across various biomedical studies demonstrate Diamond's utility in enabling more reliable data-driven scientific discoveries. This method represents a significant step forward in the deployment of ML models for scientific innovation and hypothesis generation.</description>

Abstract: Detecting anomalies or out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is critical for maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness not only in natural language processing but also in broader applications due to their advanced comprehension and generative capabilities. The integration of LLMs into anomaly and OOD detection marks a significant shift from the traditional paradigm in the field. This survey focuses on the problem of anomaly and OOD detection under the context of LLMs. We propose a new taxonomy to categorize existing approaches into two classes based on the role played by LLMs. Following our proposed taxonomy, we further discuss the related work under each of the categories and finally discuss potential challenges and directions for future research in this field. We also provide an up-to-date reading list of relevant papers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from vertical partitioned data silos is challenging due to the segmented nature of data, sample misalignment, and strict privacy concerns. Federated learning has been proposed as a solution. However, sample misalignment across silos often hinders optimal model performance and suggests data sharing within the model, which breaks privacy. Our proposed solution is Contrastive Federated Learning with Tabular Data Silos (CFL), which offers a solution for data silos with sample misalignment without the need for sharing original or representative data to maintain privacy. CFL begins with local acquisition of contrastive representations of the data within each silo and aggregates knowledge from other silos through the federated learning algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate that CFL solves the limitations of existing algorithms for data silos and outperforms existing tabular contrastive learning. CFL provides performance improvements without loosening privacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08770v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strongly depends on setting the batch size and learning rate to minimize the empirical loss in training the deep neural network. In this paper, we present theoretical analyses of mini-batch SGD with four schedulers: (i) constant batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (ii) increasing batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (iii) increasing batch size and increasing learning rate scheduler, and (iv) increasing batch size and warm-up decaying learning rate scheduler. We show that mini-batch SGD using scheduler (i) does not always minimize the expectation of the full gradient norm of the empirical loss, whereas it does using any of schedulers (ii), (iii), and (iv). Furthermore, schedulers (iii) and (iv) accelerate mini-batch SGD. The paper also provides numerical results of supporting analyses showing that using scheduler (iii) or (iv) minimizes the full gradient norm of the empirical loss faster than using scheduler (i) or (ii).</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to processing complex-valued data using DNNs consisting of parallel real-valued subnetworks with coupled outputs. Our proposed class of architectures, referred to as Steinmetz Neural Networks, incorporates multi-view learning to construct more interpretable representations in the latent space. Moreover, we present the Analytic Neural Network, which incorporates a consistency penalty that encourages analytic signal representations in the latent space of the Steinmetz neural network. This penalty enforces a deterministic and orthogonal relationship between the real and imaginary components. Using an information-theoretic construction, we demonstrate that the generalization gap upper bound posited by the analytic neural network is lower than that of the general class of Steinmetz neural networks. Our numerical experiments depict the improved performance and robustness to additive noise, afforded by our proposed networks on benchmark datasets and synthetic examples.</description>

      <title>Exploring Representations and Interventions in Time Series Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) promise to be powerful tools for a wide range of applications. However, their internal representations and learned concepts are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the structure and redundancy of representations across various TSFMs, examining the self-similarity of model layers within and across different model sizes. This analysis reveals block-like redundancy in the representations, which can be utilized for informed pruning to improve inference speed and efficiency. Additionally, we explore the concepts learned by these models - such as periodicity and trends - and how these can be manipulated through latent space steering to influence model behavior. Our experiments show that steering interventions can introduce new features, e.g., adding periodicity or trends to signals that initially lacked them. These findings underscore the value of representational analysis for optimizing models and demonstrate how conceptual steering offers new possibilities for more controlled and efficient time series analysis with TSFMs.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Conventional Wisdom in Machine Learning: From Generalization to Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable success of large language pretraining and the discovery of scaling laws signify a paradigm shift in machine learning. Notably, the primary objective has evolved from minimizing generalization error to reducing approximation error, and the most effective strategy has transitioned from regularization (in a broad sense) to scaling up models. This raises a critical question:
  Do the established principles that proved successful in the generalization-centric era remain valid in this new era of scaling?
  This paper examines several influential regularization-based principles that may no longer hold true in the scaling-centric, large language model (LLM) era. These principles include explicit L2 regularization and implicit regularization through small batch sizes and large learning rates. Additionally, we identify a new phenomenon termed ``scaling law crossover,'' where two scaling curves intersect at a certain scale, implying that methods effective at smaller scales may not generalize to larger ones. Together, these observations highlight two fundamental questions within this new paradigm:
  $\bullet$ Guiding Principles for Scaling: If regularization is no longer the primary guiding principle for model design, what new principles are emerging to guide scaling?
  $\bullet$ Model Comparison at Scale: How to reliably and effectively compare models at the scale where only a single experiment is feasible?</description>

      <title>Learning Stochastic Dynamics from Snapshots through Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learned directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/DeepRUOT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models achieve next-token prediction by transporting a vectorized piece of text (prompt) across an accompanying embedding space under the action of successive transformer layers. The resulting high-dimensional trajectories realize different contextualization, or 'thinking', steps, and fully determine the output probability distribution. We aim to characterize the statistical properties of ensembles of these 'lines of thought.' We observe that independent trajectories cluster along a low-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifold, and that their path can be well approximated by a stochastic equation with few parameters extracted from data. We find it remarkable that the vast complexity of such large models can be reduced to a much simpler form, and we reflect on implications.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction Sets Can Cause Disparate Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a statistically rigorous method for quantifying uncertainty in models by having them output sets of predictions, with larger sets indicating more uncertainty. However, prediction sets are not inherently actionable; many applications require a single output to act on, not several. To overcome this limitation, prediction sets can be provided to a human who then makes an informed decision. In any such system it is crucial to ensure the fairness of outcomes across protected groups, and researchers have proposed that Equalized Coverage be used as the standard for fairness. By conducting experiments with human participants, we demonstrate that providing prediction sets can lead to disparate impact in decisions. Disquietingly, we find that providing sets that satisfy Equalized Coverage actually increases disparate impact compared to marginal coverage. Instead of equalizing coverage, we propose to equalize set sizes across groups which empirically leads to lower disparate impact.</description>

      <title>Spatial-aware decision-making with ring attractors in reinforcement learning systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of ring attractors, a mathematical model inspired by neural circuit dynamics, into the Reinforcement Learning (RL) action selection process. Serving as specialized brain-inspired structures that encode spatial information and uncertainty, ring attractors offer a biologically plausible mechanism to improve learning speed and accuracy in RL. They do so by explicitly encoding the action space, facilitating the organization of neural activity, and enabling the distribution of spatial representations across the neural network in the context of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). For example, preserving the continuity between rotation angles in robotic control or adjacency between tactical moves in game-like environments. The application of ring attractors in the action selection process involves mapping actions to specific locations on the ring and decoding the selected action based on neural activity. We investigate the application of ring attractors by both building an exogenous model and integrating them as part of DRL agents. Our approach significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on the Atari 100k benchmark, achieving a 53\% increase in performance across selected state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>Rethinking Reward Model Evaluation: Are We Barking up the Wrong Tree?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05584v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are crucial for aligning language models with human preferences. Currently, the evaluation of RMs depends on measuring accuracy against a validation set of manually annotated preference data. Although this method is straightforward and widely adopted, the relationship between RM accuracy and downstream policy performance remains under-explored. In this work, we conduct experiments in a synthetic setting to investigate how differences in RM measured by accuracy translate into gaps in optimized policy performance. Our findings reveal that while there is a weak positive correlation between accuracy and downstream performance, policies optimized towards RMs with similar accuracy can exhibit quite different performance. Moreover, we discover that the way of measuring accuracy significantly impacts its ability to predict the final policy performance. Through the lens of the Regressional Goodhart effect, we recognize that accuracy, when used for measuring RM quality, can fail to fully capture the potential RM overoptimization. This underscores the inadequacy of relying solely on accuracy to reflect their impact on policy optimization.</description>

      <title>DimOL: Dimensional Awareness as A New 'Dimension' in Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of computational physics, an enduring topic is the numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, the attention of researchers has shifted towards Neural Operator methods, renowned for their capability to approximate ``operators'' -- mappings from functions to functions. Despite the universal approximation theorem within neural operators, ensuring error bounds often requires employing numerous Fourier layers. However, what about lightweight models? In response to this question, we introduce DimOL (Dimension-aware Operator Learning), drawing insights from dimensional analysis. To implement DimOL, we propose the ProdLayer, which can be seamlessly integrated into FNO-based and Transformer-based PDE solvers, enhancing their ability to handle sum-of-products structures inherent in many physical systems. Empirically, DimOL models achieve up to 48% performance gain within the PDE datasets. Furthermore, by analyzing Fourier components' weights, we can symbolically discern the physical significance of each term. This sheds light on the opaque nature of neural networks, unveiling underlying physical principles.</description>

      <title>TOP-ERL: Transformer-based Off-Policy Episodic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces Transformer-based Off-Policy Episodic Reinforcement Learning (TOP-ERL), a novel algorithm that enables off-policy updates in the ERL framework. In ERL, policies predict entire action trajectories over multiple time steps instead of single actions at every time step. These trajectories are typically parameterized by trajectory generators such as Movement Primitives (MP), allowing for smooth and efficient exploration over long horizons while capturing high-level temporal correlations. However, ERL methods are often constrained to on-policy frameworks due to the difficulty of evaluating state-action values for entire action sequences, limiting their sample efficiency and preventing the use of more efficient off-policy architectures. TOP-ERL addresses this shortcoming by segmenting long action sequences and estimating the state-action values for each segment using a transformer-based critic architecture alongside an n-step return estimation. These contributions result in efficient and stable training that is reflected in the empirical results conducted on sophisticated robot learning environments. TOP-ERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods. Thorough ablation studies additionally show the impact of key design choices on the model performance.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Transfer for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more prevalent, effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge while ensuring privacy has become critical. Existing methods often struggle to balance utility and privacy. For instance, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables LLMs to access domain-specific knowledge but compromises the privacy of sensitive data. On the other hand, differentially private data synthesis techniques offer strong privacy guarantees but often result in poor utility. To address this challenge, we propose Llamdex, a novel framework that enhances LLMs using only models trained on domain-specific data, integrated into LLMs through carefully designed connection modules. Our approach significantly enhances the accuracy of domain-specific tasks, achieving up to a 26% accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art data synthesis methods under the same differential privacy constraints. Experimental results show that Llamdex not only improves the accuracy of LLM responses but also maintains comparable inference efficiency to the original LLM, highlighting its potential for real applications.</description>

      <title>CATCH: Channel-Aware multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection via Frequency Patching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging as heterogeneous subsequence anomalies may occur. Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning normal patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising results, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance. We make our code and datasets available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/CATCH.</description>

Abstract: Temporal graph clustering is a complex task that involves discovering meaningful structures in dynamic graphs where relationships and entities change over time. Existing methods typically require centralized data collection, which poses significant privacy and communication challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel Federated Temporal Graph Clustering (FTGC) framework that enables decentralized training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple clients, ensuring data privacy throughout the process. Our approach incorporates a temporal aggregation mechanism to effectively capture the evolution of graph structures over time and a federated optimization strategy to collaboratively learn high-quality clustering representations. By preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead, our framework achieves competitive performance on temporal graph datasets, making it a promising solution for privacy-sensitive, real-world applications involving dynamic data.</description>

      <title>MathGAP: Out-of-Distribution Evaluation on Problems with Arbitrarily Complex Proofs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can solve arithmetic word problems with high accuracy, but little is known about how well they generalize to more complex problems. This is difficult to study, as (i) much of the available evaluation data has already been seen by the most capable models during training, and (ii) existing benchmarks do not capture how problem proofs may be arbitrarily complex in various ways. In this paper, we present a data-generation framework for evaluating LLMs on problems with arbitrarily complex arithmetic proofs, called MathGAP. MathGAP generates problem statements and chain-of-thought reasoning traces according to specifications about their arithmetic proof structure, enabling systematic studies on easy-to-hard generalization with respect to complexity of proof trees. Using MathGAP, we find that LLMs show a significant decrease in performance as proofs get deeper and wider. This effect is more pronounced in complex, nonlinear proof structures, which are challenging even for the most capable models. The models are also sensitive to simple changes in sentence ordering. However, they remain capable of solving some complex problems, suggesting that reasoning generalization is noisy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been known in both neuroscience and AI that ``binding'' between neurons leads to a form of competitive learning where representations are compressed in order to represent more abstract concepts in deeper layers of the network. More recently, it was also hypothesized that dynamic (spatiotemporal) representations play an important role in both neuroscience and AI. Building on these ideas, we introduce Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons (AKOrN) as a dynamical alternative to threshold units, which can be combined with arbitrary connectivity designs such as fully connected, convolutional, or attentive mechanisms. Our generalized Kuramoto updates bind neurons together through their synchronization dynamics. We show that this idea provides performance improvements across a wide spectrum of tasks such as unsupervised object discovery, adversarial robustness, calibrated uncertainty quantification, and reasoning. We believe that these empirical results show the importance of rethinking our assumptions at the most basic neuronal level of neural representation, and in particular show the importance of dynamical representations.

      <title>Sliding Puzzles Gym: A Scalable Benchmark for State Representation in Visual Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning effective visual representations enables agents to extract meaningful information from raw sensory inputs, which is essential for generalizing across different tasks. However, evaluating representation learning separately from policy learning remains a challenge with most reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce the Sliding Puzzles Gym (SPGym), a novel benchmark that reimagines the classic 8-tile puzzle with a visual observation space of images sourced from arbitrarily large datasets. SPGym provides precise control over representation complexity through visual diversity, allowing researchers to systematically scale the representation learning challenge while maintaining consistent environment dynamics. Despite the apparent simplicity of the task, our experiments with both model-free and model-based RL algorithms reveal fundamental limitations in current methods. As we increase visual diversity by expanding the pool of possible images, all tested algorithms show significant performance degradation, with even state-of-the-art methods struggling to generalize across different visual inputs while maintaining consistent puzzle-solving capabilities. These results highlight critical gaps in visual representation learning for RL and provide clear directions for improving robustness and generalization in decision-making systems.</description>

      <title>Strada-LLM: Graph LLM for traffic prediction</title>

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a vital component of intelligent transportation systems. By reasoning about traffic patterns in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, accurate and interpretable predictions can be provided. A considerable challenge in traffic prediction lies in handling the diverse data distributions caused by vastly different traffic conditions occurring at different locations. LLMs have been a dominant solution due to their remarkable capacity to adapt to new datasets with very few labeled data samples, i.e., few-shot adaptability. However, existing forecasting techniques mainly focus on extracting local graph information and forming a text-like prompt, leaving LLM- based traffic prediction an open problem. This work presents a probabilistic LLM for traffic forecasting with three highlights. We propose a graph-aware LLM for traffic prediction that considers proximal traffic information. Specifically, by considering the traffic of neighboring nodes as covariates, our model outperforms the corresponding time-series LLM. Furthermore, we adopt a lightweight approach for efficient domain adaptation when facing new data distributions in few-shot fashion. The comparative experiment demonstrates the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and the traditional GNN- based supervised approaches. Furthermore, Strada-LLM can be easily adapted to different LLM backbones without a noticeable performance drop.</description>

Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. A key challenge in developing these general capabilities is efficiently sourcing diverse, high-quality data. This becomes especially critical in reasoning-related tasks with sandbox checkers, such as math or code, where the goal is to generate correct solutions to specific problems with higher probability. In this work, we introduce Flaming-hot Initiation with Regular Execution (FIRE) sampling, a simple yet highly effective method to efficiently find good responses. Our empirical findings show that FIRE sampling enhances inference-time generation quality and also benefits training in the alignment stage. Furthermore, we explore how FIRE sampling improves performance by promoting diversity and analyze the impact of employing FIRE at different positions within a response.</description>

      <title>The Graph's Apprentice: Teaching an LLM Low Level Knowledge for Circuit Quality Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logic synthesis is a crucial phase in the circuit design process, responsible for transforming hardware description language (HDL) designs into optimized netlists. However, traditional logic synthesis methods are computationally intensive, restricting their iterative use in refining chip designs. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), particularly those fine-tuned on programming languages, present a promising alternative. This work proposes augmenting LLMs with predictor networks trained to estimate circuit quality directly from HDL code. To enhance performance, the model is regularized using embeddings from graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on Look-Up Table (LUT) graphs, thereby incorporating lower-level circuit insights. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing graph-based RTL-level estimation techniques on the established benchmark OpenABCD, while providing instant feedback on HDL code quality.</description>

      <title>Mechanism and Emergence of Stacked Attention Heads in Multi-Layer Transformers</title>

Abstract: In this paper, I introduce the retrieval problem, a simple yet common reasoning task that can be solved only by transformers with a minimum number of layers, which grows logarithmically with the input size. I empirically show that large language models can solve the task under different prompting formulations without any fine-tuning. To understand how transformers solve the retrieval problem, I train several transformers on a minimal formulation. Successful learning occurs only under the presence of an implicit curriculum. I uncover the learned mechanisms by studying the attention maps in the trained transformers. I also study the training process, uncovering that attention heads always emerge in a specific sequence guided by the implicit curriculum.</description>

      <title>THESAURUS: Contrastive Graph Clustering by Swapping Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph node clustering is a fundamental unsupervised task. Existing methods typically train an encoder through selfsupervised learning and then apply K-means to the encoder output. Some methods use this clustering result directly as the final assignment, while others initialize centroids based on this initial clustering and then finetune both the encoder and these learnable centroids. However, due to their reliance on K-means, these methods inherit its drawbacks when the cluster separability of encoder output is low, facing challenges from the Uniform Effect and Cluster Assimilation. We summarize three reasons for the low cluster separability in existing methods: (1) lack of contextual information prevents discrimination between similar nodes from different clusters; (2) training tasks are not sufficiently aligned with the downstream clustering task; (3) the cluster information in the graph structure is not appropriately exploited. To address these issues, we propose conTrastive grapH clustEring by SwApping fUsed gRomov-wasserstein coUplingS (THESAURUS). Our method introduces semantic prototypes to provide contextual information, and employs a cross-view assignment prediction pretext task that aligns well with the downstream clustering task. Additionally, it utilizes Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GW-OT) along with the proposed prototype graph to thoroughly exploit cluster information in the graph structure. To adapt to diverse real-world data, THESAURUS updates the prototype graph and the prototype marginal distribution in OT by using momentum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THESAURUS achieves higher cluster separability than the prior art, effectively mitigating the Uniform Effect and Cluster Assimilation issues</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accelerating model convergence within resource-constrained environments is critical to ensure fast and efficient neural network training. This work presents learn2mix, a novel training strategy that adaptively adjusts class proportions within batches, focusing on classes with higher error rates. Unlike classical training methods that use static class proportions, learn2mix continually adapts class proportions during training, leading to faster convergence. Empirical evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets show that neural networks trained with learn2mix converge faster than those trained with existing approaches, achieving improved results for classification, regression, and reconstruction tasks under limited training resources and with imbalanced classes. Our empirical findings are supported by theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Examining Imbalance Effects on Performance and Demographic Fairness of Clinical Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data imbalance is a fundamental challenge in applying language models to biomedical applications, particularly in ICD code prediction tasks where label and demographic distributions are uneven. While state-of-the-art language models have been increasingly adopted in biomedical tasks, few studies have systematically examined how data imbalance affects model performance and fairness across demographic groups. This study fills the gap by statistically probing the relationship between data imbalance and model performance in ICD code prediction. We analyze imbalances in a standard benchmark data across gender, age, ethnicity, and social determinants of health by state-of-the-art biomedical language models. By deploying diverse performance metrics and statistical analyses, we explore the influence of data imbalance on performance variations and demographic fairness. Our study shows that data imbalance significantly impacts model performance and fairness, but feature similarity to the majority class may be a more critical factor. We believe this study provides valuable insights for developing more equitable and robust language models in healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Zero Shot Time Series Forecasting Using Kolmogorov Arnold Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate energy price forecasting is crucial for participants in day-ahead energy markets, as it significantly influences their decision-making processes. While machine learning-based approaches have shown promise in enhancing these forecasts, they often remain confined to the specific markets on which they are trained, thereby limiting their adaptability to new or unseen markets. In this paper, we introduce a cross-domain adaptation model designed to forecast energy prices by learning market-invariant representations across different markets during the training phase. We propose a doubly residual N-BEATS network with Kolmogorov Arnold networks at its core for time series forecasting. These networks, grounded in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, offer a powerful way to approximate multivariate continuous functions. The cross domain adaptation model was generated with an adversarial framework. The model's effectiveness was tested in predicting day-ahead electricity prices in a zero shot fashion. In comparison with baseline models, our proposed framework shows promising results. By leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, our model can potentially enhance its ability to capture complex patterns in energy price data, thus improving forecast accuracy across diverse market conditions. This addition not only enriches the model's representational capacity but also contributes to a more robust and flexible forecasting tool adaptable to various energy markets.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Models and Conditional Expectation -- Analysing Parametric Low-Order Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems may depend on parameters which one may control, or which serve to optimise the system, or are imposed externally, or they could be uncertain. This last case is taken as the ``Leitmotiv'' for the following. A reduced order model is produced from the full order model by some kind of projection onto a relatively low-dimensional manifold or subspace. The parameter dependent reduction process produces a function of the parameters into the manifold. One now wants to examine the relation between the full and the reduced state for all possible parameter values of interest. Similarly, in the field of machine learning, also a function of the parameter set into the image space of the machine learning model is learned on a training set of samples, typically minimising the mean-square error. This set may be seen as a sample from some probability distribution, and thus the training is an approximate computation of the expectation, giving an approximation to the conditional expectation, a special case of an Bayesian updating where the Bayesian loss function is the mean-square error. This offers the possibility of having a combined look at these methods, and also of introducing more general loss functions.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning has shown impressive results obtained at the cost of training huge neural networks. However, the larger the architecture, the higher the computational, financial, and environmental costs during training and inference. We aim at reducing both training and inference durations. We focus on Neural Architecture Growth, which can increase the size of a small model when needed, directly during training using information from the backpropagation. We expand existing work and freely grow neural networks in the form of any Directed Acyclic Graph by reducing expressivity bottlenecks in the architecture. We explore strategies to reduce excessive computations and steer network growth toward more parameter-efficient architectures.</description>

      <title>Online Inverse Linear Optimization: Improved Regret Bound, Robustness to Suboptimality, and Toward Tight Regret Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14349v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an online learning problem where, over $T$ rounds, a learner observes both time-varying sets of feasible actions and an agent's optimal actions, selected by solving linear optimization over the feasible actions. The learner sequentially makes predictions of the agent's underlying linear objective function, and their quality is measured by the regret, the cumulative gap between optimal objective values and those achieved by following the learner's predictions. A seminal work by B\"armann et al. (ICML 2017) showed that online learning methods can be applied to this problem to achieve regret bounds of $O(\sqrt{T})$. Recently, Besbes et al. (COLT 2021, Oper. Res. 2023) significantly improved the result by achieving an $O(n^4\ln T)$ regret bound, where $n$ is the dimension of the ambient space of objective vectors. Their method, based on the ellipsoid method, runs in polynomial time but is inefficient for large $n$ and $T$. In this paper, we obtain an $O(n\ln T)$ regret bound, improving upon the previous bound of $O(n^4\ln T)$ by a factor of $n^3$. Our method is simple and efficient: we apply the online Newton step (ONS) to appropriate exp-concave loss functions. Moreover, for the case where the agent's actions are possibly suboptimal, we establish an $O(n\ln T+\sqrt{\Delta_Tn\ln T})$ regret bound, where $\Delta_T$ is the cumulative suboptimality of the agent's actions. This bound is achieved by using MetaGrad, which runs ONS with $\Theta(\ln T)$ different learning rates in parallel. We also provide a simple instance that implies an $\Omega(n)$ lower bound, showing that our $O(n\ln T)$ bound is tight up to an $O(\ln T)$ factor. This gives rise to a natural question: can the $O(\ln T)$ factor in the upper bound be removed? For the special case of $n=2$, we show that an $O(1)$ regret bound is possible, while we delineate challenges in extending this result to higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The increasing complexity of AI systems has made understanding their behavior a critical challenge. Numerous methods have been developed to attribute model behavior to three key aspects: input features, training data, and internal model components. However, these attribution methods are studied and applied rather independently, resulting in a fragmented landscape of approaches and terminology. This position paper argues that feature, data, and component attribution methods share fundamental similarities, and bridging them can benefit interpretability research. We conduct a detailed analysis of successful methods of these three attribution aspects and present a unified view to demonstrate that these seemingly distinct methods employ similar approaches, such as perturbations, gradients, and linear approximations, differing primarily in their perspectives rather than core techniques. Our unified perspective enhances understanding of existing attribution methods, identifies shared concepts and challenges, makes this field more accessible to newcomers, and highlights new directions not only for attribution and interpretability but also for broader AI research, including model editing, steering, and regulation.</description>

Abstract: XNet is a single-layer neural network architecture that leverages Cauchy integral-based activation functions for high-order function approximation. Through theoretical analysis, we show that the Cauchy activation functions used in XNet can achieve arbitrary-order polynomial convergence, fundamentally outperforming traditional MLPs and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that rely on increased depth or B-spline activations. Our extensive experiments on function approximation, PDE solving, and reinforcement learning demonstrate XNet's superior performance - reducing approximation error by up to 50000 times and accelerating training by up to 10 times compared to existing approaches. These results establish XNet as a highly efficient architecture for both scientific computing and AI applications.</description>

      <title>A Communication Framework for Compositional Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compositionality and compositional generalization--the ability to understand novel combinations of known concepts--are central characteristics of human language and are hypothesized to be essential for human cognition. In machine learning, the emergence of this property has been studied in a communication game setting, where independent agents (a sender and a receiver) converge to a shared encoding policy from a set of states to a space of discrete messages, where the receiver can correctly reconstruct the states observed by the sender using only the sender's messages. The use of communication games in generation tasks is still largely unexplored, with recent methods for compositional generation focusing mainly on the use of supervised guidance (either through class labels or text). In this work, we take the first steps to fill this gap, and we present a self-supervised generative communication game-based framework for creating compositional encodings in learned representations from pre-trained encoder-decoder models. In an Iterated Learning (IL) protocol involving a sender and a receiver, we apply alternating pressures for compression and diversity of encoded discrete messages, so that the protocol converges to an efficient but unambiguous encoding. Approximate message entropy regularization is used to favor compositional encodings. Our framework is based on rigorous justifications and proofs of defining and balancing the concepts of Efficiency, Unambiguity and Non-Holisticity in encoding. We test our method on the compositional image dataset Shapes3D, demonstrating robust performance in both reconstruction and compositionality metrics, surpassing other tested discrete message frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Importance: Emergency department (ED) returns for mental health conditions pose a major healthcare burden, with 24-27% of patients returning within 30 days. Traditional machine learning models for predicting these returns often lack interpretability for clinical use.
  Objective: To assess whether integrating large language models (LLMs) with machine learning improves predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability of ED mental health return risk models.
  Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 42,464 ED visits for 27,904 unique mental health patients at an academic medical center in the Deep South from January 2018 to December 2022.
  Main Outcomes and Measures: Two primary outcomes were evaluated: (1) 30-day ED return prediction accuracy and (2) model interpretability using a novel LLM-enhanced framework integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values with clinical knowledge.
  Results: For chief complaint classification, LLaMA 3 (8B) with 10-shot learning outperformed traditional models (accuracy: 0.882, F1-score: 0.86). In SDoH classification, LLM-based models achieved 0.95 accuracy and 0.96 F1-score, with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Substance Abuse performing best (F1: 0.96-0.89), while Exercise and Home Environment showed lower performance (F1: 0.70-0.67). The LLM-based interpretability framework achieved 99% accuracy in translating model predictions into clinically relevant explanations. LLM-extracted features improved XGBoost AUC from 0.74 to 0.76 and AUC-PR from 0.58 to 0.61.
  Conclusions and Relevance: Integrating LLMs with machine learning models yielded modest but consistent accuracy gains while significantly enhancing interpretability through automated, clinically relevant explanations. This approach provides a framework for translating predictive analytics into actionable clinical insights.</description>

      <title>A Relative Homology Theory of Representation in Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which the network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
  In this work, we leverage these properties to define the equivalence class of inputs $\sim_\Phi$, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the overlap decomposition $O_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and the input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to relative homology groups $H_k(\Phi(M)) \simeq H_k(M,O_\Phi)$. This lets us compute Betti numbers without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our relative homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on various classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.</description>

      <title>Task-Aware Virtual Training: Enhancing Generalization in Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Out-of-Distribution Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning aims to develop policies that generalize to unseen tasks sampled from a task distribution. While context-based meta-RL methods improve task representation using task latents, they often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To address this, we propose Task-Aware Virtual Training (TAVT), a novel algorithm that accurately captures task characteristics for both training and OOD scenarios using metric-based representation learning. Our method successfully preserves task characteristics in virtual tasks and employs a state regularization technique to mitigate overestimation errors in state-varying environments. Numerical results demonstrate that TAVT significantly enhances generalization to OOD tasks across various MuJoCo and MetaWorld environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional robust methods in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) often struggle against coordinated adversarial attacks in cooperative scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose the Wolfpack Adversarial Attack framework, inspired by wolf hunting strategies, which targets an initial agent and its assisting agents to disrupt cooperation. Additionally, we introduce the Wolfpack-Adversarial Learning for MARL (WALL) framework, which trains robust MARL policies to defend against the proposed Wolfpack attack by fostering system-wide collaboration. Experimental results underscore the devastating impact of the Wolfpack attack and the significant robustness improvements achieved by WALL.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Aware Bayesian Flow Networks for Crystal Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of new crystalline materials is essential to scientific and technological progress. However, traditional trial-and-error approaches are inefficient due to the vast search space. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled generative models to predict new stable materials by incorporating structural symmetries and to condition the generation on desired properties. In this work, we introduce SymmBFN, a novel symmetry-aware Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) for crystalline material generation that accurately reproduces the distribution of space groups found in experimentally observed crystals. SymmBFN substantially improves efficiency, generating stable structures at least 50 times faster than the next-best method. Furthermore, we demonstrate its capability for property-conditioned generation, enabling the design of materials with tailored properties. Our findings establish BFNs as an effective tool for accelerating the discovery of crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Explain Yourself, Briefly! Self-Explaining Neural Networks with Concise Sufficient Reasons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: *Minimal sufficient reasons* represent a prevalent form of explanation - the smallest subset of input features which, when held constant at their corresponding values, ensure that the prediction remains unchanged. Previous *post-hoc* methods attempt to obtain such explanations but face two main limitations: (1) Obtaining these subsets poses a computational challenge, leading most scalable methods to converge towards suboptimal, less meaningful subsets; (2) These methods heavily rely on sampling out-of-distribution input assignments, potentially resulting in counterintuitive behaviors. To tackle these limitations, we propose in this work a self-supervised training approach, which we term *sufficient subset training* (SST). Using SST, we train models to generate concise sufficient reasons for their predictions as an integral part of their output. Our results indicate that our framework produces succinct and faithful subsets substantially more efficiently than competing post-hoc methods, while maintaining comparable predictive performance.</description>

      <title>PRISM: A Robust Framework for Skill-based Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Noisy Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) facilitates rapid adaptation to unseen tasks but faces challenges in long-horizon environments. Skill-based approaches tackle this by decomposing state-action sequences into reusable skills and employing hierarchical decision-making. However, these methods are highly susceptible to noisy offline demonstrations, resulting in unstable skill learning and degraded performance. To overcome this, we propose Prioritized Refinement for Skill-Based Meta-RL (PRISM), a robust framework that integrates exploration near noisy data to generate online trajectories and combines them with offline data. Through prioritization, PRISM extracts high-quality data to learn task-relevant skills effectively. By addressing the impact of noise, our method ensures stable skill learning and achieves superior performance in long-horizon tasks, even with noisy and sub-optimal data.</description>

      <title>Exploit Gradient Skewness to Circumvent Byzantine Defenses for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is notorious for its vulnerability to Byzantine attacks. Most current Byzantine defenses share a common inductive bias: among all the gradients, the densely distributed ones are more likely to be honest. However, such a bias is a poison to Byzantine robustness due to a newly discovered phenomenon in this paper - gradient skew. We discover that a group of densely distributed honest gradients skew away from the optimal gradient (the average of honest gradients) due to heterogeneous data. This gradient skew phenomenon allows Byzantine gradients to hide within the densely distributed skewed gradients. As a result, Byzantine defenses are confused into believing that Byzantine gradients are honest. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel skew-aware attack called STRIKE: first, we search for the skewed gradients; then, we construct Byzantine gradients within the skewed gradients. Experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our attack</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Reservoir State Analysis for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a growing data privacy concern, federated learning has emerged as a promising framework to train machine learning models without sharing locally distributed data. In federated learning, local model training by multiple clients and model integration by a server are repeated only through model parameter sharing. Most existing federated learning methods assume training deep learning models, which are often computationally demanding. To deal with this issue, we propose federated learning methods with reservoir state analysis to seek computational efficiency and data privacy protection simultaneously. Specifically, our method relies on Mahalanobis Distance of Reservoir States (MD-RS) method targeting time series anomaly detection, which learns a distribution of reservoir states for normal inputs and detects anomalies based on a deviation from the learned distribution. Iterative updating of statistical parameters in the MD-RS enables incremental federated learning (IncFed MD-RS). We evaluate the performance of IncFed MD-RS using benchmark datasets for time series anomaly detection. The results show that IncFed MD-RS outperforms other federated learning methods with deep learning and reservoir computing models particularly when clients' data are relatively short and heterogeneous. We demonstrate that IncFed MD-RS is robust against reduced sample data compared to other methods. We also show that the computational cost of IncFed MD-RS can be reduced by subsampling from the reservoir states without performance degradation. The proposed method is beneficial especially in anomaly detection applications where computational efficiency, algorithm simplicity, and low communication cost are required.</description>

      <title>Low Tensor-Rank Adaptation of Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold networks (KANs) have demonstrated their potential as an alternative to multi-layer perceptions (MLPs) in various domains, especially for science-related tasks. However, transfer learning of KANs remains a relatively unexplored area. In this paper, inspired by Tucker decomposition of tensors and evidence on the low tensor-rank structure in KAN parameter updates, we develop low tensor-rank adaptation (LoTRA) for fine-tuning KANs. We study the expressiveness of LoTRA based on Tucker decomposition approximations. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to select the learning rates for each LoTRA component to enable efficient training. Our analysis also shows that using identical learning rates across all components leads to inefficient training, highlighting the need for an adaptive learning rate strategy. Beyond theoretical insights, we explore the application of LoTRA for efficiently solving various partial differential equations (PDEs) by fine-tuning KANs. Additionally, we propose Slim KANs that incorporate the inherent low-tensor-rank properties of KAN parameter tensors to reduce model size while maintaining superior performance. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed learning rate selection strategy and demonstrate the effectiveness of LoTRA for transfer learning of KANs in solving PDEs. Further evaluations on Slim KANs for function representation and image classification tasks highlight the expressiveness of LoTRA and the potential for parameter reduction through low tensor-rank decomposition.</description>

      <title>Analog In-memory Training on General Non-ideal Resistive Elements: The Impact of Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the economic and environmental costs of training and deploying large vision or language models increase dramatically, analog in-memory computing (AIMC) emerges as a promising energy-efficient solution. However, the training perspective, especially its training dynamic, is underexplored. In AIMC hardware, the trainable weights are represented by the conductance of resistive elements and updated using consecutive electrical pulses. Among all the physical properties of resistive elements, the response to the pulses directly affects the training dynamics. This paper first provides a theoretical foundation for gradient-based training on AIMC hardware and studies the impact of response functions. We demonstrate that noisy update and asymmetric response functions negatively impact Analog SGD by imposing an implicit penalty term on the objective. To overcome the issue, Tiki-Taka, a residual learning algorithm, converges exactly to a critical point by optimizing a main array and a residual array bilevelly. The conclusion is supported by simulations validating our theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>Goedel-Prover: A Frontier Model for Open-Source Automated Theorem Proving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover, an open-source large language model (LLM) that achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in automated formal proof generation for mathematical problems. The key challenge in this field is the scarcity of formalized math statements and proofs, which we tackle in the following ways. We train statement formalizers to translate the natural language math problems from Numina into formal language (Lean 4), creating a dataset of 1.64 million formal statements. LLMs are used to check that the formal statements accurately preserve the content of the original natural language problems. We then iteratively build a large dataset of formal proofs by training a series of provers. Each prover succeeds in proving many statements that the previous ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for the next prover. Despite using only supervised fine-tuning, our final prover significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5, which employs reinforcement learning. On the miniF2F benchmark, our model achieves a success rate of 57.6% (Pass@32), surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 by 7.6%. On PutnamBench, Goedel-Prover successfully solves 7 problems (Pass@512), ranking first on the leaderboard. Furthermore, it generates 29.7K formal proofs for Lean Workbook problems, nearly doubling the 15.7K produced by earlier works.</description>

      <title>Implicit Language Models are RNNs: Balancing Parallelization and Expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) and transformers dominate the language modeling landscape. However, they are constrained to a lower computational complexity than classical recurrent neural networks (RNNs), limiting their expressivity. In contrast, RNNs lack parallelization during training, raising fundamental questions about the trade off between parallelization and expressivity. We propose implicit SSMs, which iterate a transformation until convergence to a fixed point. Theoretically, we show that implicit SSMs implement the non-linear state-transitions of RNNs. Empirically, we find that only approximate fixed-point convergence suffices, enabling the design of a scalable training curriculum that largely retains parallelization, with full convergence required only for a small subset of tokens. Our approach demonstrates superior state-tracking capabilities on regular languages, surpassing transformers and SSMs. We further scale implicit SSMs to natural language reasoning tasks and pretraining of large-scale language models up to 1.3B parameters on 207B tokens - representing, to our knowledge, the largest implicit model trained to date. Notably, our implicit models outperform their explicit counterparts on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new computational tool TumorGrowth$.$jl for modeling tumor growth is introduced. The tool allows the comparison of standard textbook models, such as General Bertalanffy and Gompertz, with some newer models, including, for the first time, neural ODE models. As an application, we revisit a human meta-study of non-small cell lung cancer and bladder cancer lesions, in patients undergoing two different treatment options, to determine if previously reported performance differences are statistically significant, and if newer, more complex models perform any better. In a population of examples with at least four time-volume measurements available for calibration, and an average of about 6.3, our main conclusion is that the General Bertalanffy model has superior performance, on average. However, where more measurements are available, we argue that more complex models, capable of capturing rebound and relapse behavior, may be better choices.</description>

      <title>An Interactive Framework for Implementing Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning: Experiments on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy by keeping user data on local devices. However, emerging attacks have demonstrated that the updates shared by users during training can reveal significant information about their data. This has greatly thwart the adoption of FL methods for training robust AI models in sensitive applications. Differential Privacy (DP) is considered the gold standard for safeguarding user data. However, DP guarantees are highly conservative, providing worst-case privacy guarantees. This can result in overestimating privacy needs, which may compromise the model's accuracy. Additionally, interpretations of these privacy guarantees have proven to be challenging in different contexts. This is further exacerbated when other factors, such as the number of training iterations, data distribution, and specific application requirements, can add further complexity to this problem. In this work, we proposed a framework that integrates a human entity as a privacy practitioner to determine an optimal trade-off between the model's privacy and utility. Our framework is the first to address the variable memory requirement of existing DP methods in FL settings, where resource-limited devices (e.g., cell phones) can participate. To support such settings, we adopt a recent DP method with fixed memory usage to ensure scalable private FL. We evaluated our proposed framework by fine-tuning a BERT-based LLM model using the GLUE dataset (a common approach in literature), leveraging the new accountant, and employing diverse data partitioning strategies to mimic real-world conditions. As a result, we achieved stable memory usage, with an average accuracy reduction of 1.33% for $\epsilon = 10$ and 1.9% for $\epsilon = 6$, when compared to the state-of-the-art DP accountant which does not support fixed memory usage.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning of Linear Dynamical Systems with Transformers: Error Bounds and Depth-Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates approximation-theoretic aspects of the in-context learning capability of the transformers in representing a family of noisy linear dynamical systems. Our first theoretical result establishes an upper bound on the approximation error of multi-layer transformers with respect to an $L^2$-testing loss uniformly defined across tasks. This result demonstrates that transformers with logarithmic depth can achieve error bounds comparable with those of the least-squares estimator. In contrast, our second result establishes a non-diminishing lower bound on the approximation error for a class of single-layer linear transformers, which suggests a depth-separation phenomenon for transformers in the in-context learning of dynamical systems. Moreover, this second result uncovers a critical distinction in the approximation power of single-layer linear transformers when learning from IID versus non-IID data.</description>

      <title>LucidAtlas$: Learning Uncertainty-Aware, Covariate-Disentangled, Individualized Atlas Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to develop principled techniques to extract information from high dimensional data sets with complex dependencies in areas such as medicine that can provide insight into individual as well as population level variation. We develop $\texttt{LucidAtlas}$, an approach that can represent spatially varying information, and can capture the influence of covariates as well as population uncertainty. As a versatile atlas representation, $\texttt{LucidAtlas}$ offers robust capabilities for covariate interpretation, individualized prediction, population trend analysis, and uncertainty estimation, with the flexibility to incorporate prior knowledge. Additionally, we discuss the trustworthiness and potential risks of neural additive models for analyzing dependent covariates and then introduce a marginalization approach to explain the dependence of an individual predictor on the models' response (the atlas). To validate our method, we demonstrate its generalizability on two medical datasets. Our findings underscore the critical role of by-construction interpretable models in advancing scientific discovery. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptation and learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brain can rapidly adapt to new contexts and learn from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence algorithms have struggled to mimic. Inspired by oscillatory rhythms of the mechanical structures of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm that is based on oscillations in link strengths and associates learning with the coordination of these oscillations. We find that this paradigm yields rapid adaptation and learning in artificial neural networks. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, endowing the network with the ability to sense subtle context changes in an unsupervised manner. In other words, the network generates the missing contextual tokens required to perform as a generalist AI architecture capable of predicting dynamics in multiple contexts. Oscillations also allow the network to extrapolate dynamics to never-seen-before contexts. These capabilities make our learning paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of learning and cognition. Furthermore, learning through link coordination is agnostic to the specifics of the neural network architecture, hence our study opens the door for introducing rapid adaptation and learning capabilities into leading AI models.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Off-Policy $n$-Step TD-Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes multi-step temporal difference (TD)-learning algorithms within the ``deadly triad'' scenario, characterized by linear function approximation, off-policy learning, and bootstrapping. In particular, we prove that $n$-step TD-learning algorithms converge to a solution as the sampling horizon $n$ increases sufficiently. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, we comprehensively examine the fundamental properties of their model-based deterministic counterparts, including projected value iteration, gradient descent algorithms, which can be viewed as prototype deterministic algorithms whose analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding and developing their model-free reinforcement learning counterparts. In particular, we prove that these algorithms converge to meaningful solutions when $n$ is sufficiently large. Based on these findings, in the second part, two $n$-step TD-learning algorithms are proposed and analyzed, which can be seen as the model-free reinforcement learning counterparts of the model-based deterministic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Neural Force Field: Learning Generalized Physical Representation from a Few Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical reasoning is a remarkable human ability that enables rapid learning and generalization from limited experience. Current AI models, despite extensive training, still struggle to achieve similar generalization, especially in Out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. This limitation stems from their inability to abstract core physical principles from observations. A key challenge is developing representations that can efficiently learn and generalize physical dynamics from minimal data. Here we present Neural Force Field (NFF) a modeling framework built on Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) that learns interpretable force field representations which can be efficiently integrated through an Ordinary Differential Equation ( ODE) solver to predict object trajectories. Unlike existing approaches that rely on high-dimensional latent spaces, NFF captures fundamental physical concepts such as gravity, support, and collision in an interpretable manner. Experiments on two challenging physical reasoning tasks demonstrate that NFF, trained with only a few examples, achieves strong generalization to unseen scenarios. This physics-grounded representation enables efficient forward-backward planning and rapid adaptation through interactive refinement. Our work suggests that incorporating physics-inspired representations into learning systems can help bridge the gap between artificial and human physical reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>LiSA: Leveraging Link Recommender to Attack Graph Neural Networks via Subgraph Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in modeling data with graph structures, yet recent research reveals their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Traditional attack methodologies, which rely on manipulating the original graph or adding links to artificially created nodes, often prove impractical in real-world settings. This paper introduces a novel adversarial scenario involving the injection of an isolated subgraph to deceive both the link recommender and the node classifier within a GNN system. Specifically, the link recommender is mislead to propose links between targeted victim nodes and the subgraph, encouraging users to unintentionally establish connections and that would degrade the node classification accuracy, thereby facilitating a successful attack. To address this, we present the LiSA framework, which employs a dual surrogate model and bi-level optimization to simultaneously meet two adversarial objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>LoRA Training Provably Converges to a Low-Rank Global Minimum or It Fails Loudly (But it Probably Won't Fail)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard approach for fine-tuning large foundation models. However, our theoretical understanding of LoRA remains limited as prior analyses of LoRA's training dynamics either rely on linearization arguments or consider highly simplified setups. In this work, we analyze the LoRA loss landscape without such restrictive assumptions. We define two regimes: a ``special regime'', which includes idealized setups where linearization arguments hold, and a ``generic regime'' representing more realistic setups where linearization arguments do not hold. In the generic regime, we show that LoRA training converges to a global minimizer with low rank and small magnitude, or a qualitatively distinct solution with high rank and large magnitude. Finally, we argue that the zero-initialization and weight decay in LoRA training induce an implicit bias toward the low-rank, small-magnitude region of the parameter space -- where global minima lie -- thus shedding light on why LoRA training usually succeeds in finding global minima.</description>

      <title>Learning to Predict Global Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics from Sparse Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Catheter ablation of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) consists of a one-size-fits-all treatment with limited success in persistent AF. This may be due to our inability to map the dynamics of AF with the limited resolution and coverage provided by sequential contact mapping catheters, preventing effective patient phenotyping for personalised, targeted ablation. Here we introduce FibMap, a graph recurrent neural network model that reconstructs global AF dynamics from sparse measurements. Trained and validated on 51 non-contact whole atria recordings, FibMap reconstructs whole atria dynamics from 10% surface coverage, achieving a 210% lower mean absolute error and an order of magnitude higher performance in tracking phase singularities compared to baseline methods. Clinical utility of FibMap is demonstrated on real-world contact mapping recordings, achieving reconstruction fidelity comparable to non-contact mapping. FibMap's state-spaces and patient-specific parameters offer insights for electrophenotyping AF. Integrating FibMap into clinical practice could enable personalised AF care and improve outcomes.</description>

      <title>Eidetic Learning: an Efficient and Provable Solution to Catastrophic Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting -- the phenomenon of a neural network learning a task t1 and losing the ability to perform it after being trained on some other task t2 -- is a long-standing problem for neural networks [McCloskey and Cohen, 1989]. We present a method, Eidetic Learning, that provably solves catastrophic forgetting. A network trained with Eidetic Learning -- here, an EideticNet -- requires no rehearsal or replay. We consider successive discrete tasks and show how at inference time an EideticNet automatically routes new instances without auxiliary task information. An EideticNet bears a family resemblance to the sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts layer Shazeer et al. [2016] in that network capacity is partitioned across tasks and the network itself performs data-conditional routing. An EideticNet is easy to implement and train, is efficient, and has time and space complexity linear in the number of parameters. The guarantee of our method holds for normalization layers of modern neural networks during both pre-training and fine-tuning. We show with a variety of network architectures and sets of tasks that EideticNets are immune to forgetting. While the practical benefits of EideticNets are substantial, we believe they can be benefit practitioners and theorists alike. The code for training EideticNets is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/eideticnet-training.</description>

      <title>EQ-VAE: Equivariance Regularized Latent Space for Improved Generative Image Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent generative models have emerged as a leading approach for high-quality image synthesis. These models rely on an autoencoder to compress images into a latent space, followed by a generative model to learn the latent distribution. We identify that existing autoencoders lack equivariance to semantic-preserving transformations like scaling and rotation, resulting in complex latent spaces that hinder generative performance. To address this, we propose EQ-VAE, a simple regularization approach that enforces equivariance in the latent space, reducing its complexity without degrading reconstruction quality. By finetuning pre-trained autoencoders with EQ-VAE, we enhance the performance of several state-of-the-art generative models, including DiT, SiT, REPA and MaskGIT, achieving a 7 speedup on DiT-XL/2 with only five epochs of SD-VAE fine-tuning. EQ-VAE is compatible with both continuous and discrete autoencoders, thus offering a versatile enhancement for a wide range of latent generative models.

      <description>arXiv:2502.09609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Score-of-Mixture Training (SMT), a novel framework for training one-step generative models by minimizing a class of divergences called the $\alpha$-skew Jensen-Shannon divergence. At its core, SMT estimates the score of mixture distributions between real and fake samples across multiple noise levels. Similar to consistency models, our approach supports both training from scratch (SMT) and distillation using a pretrained diffusion model, which we call Score-of-Mixture Distillation (SMD). It is simple to implement, requires minimal hyperparameter tuning, and ensures stable training. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64 show that SMT/SMD are competitive with and can even outperform existing methods.</description>

      <title>Auto.gov: Learning-based Governance for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an integral component of the blockchain ecosystem, enabling a range of financial activities through smart-contract-based protocols. Traditional DeFi governance typically involves manual parameter adjustments by protocol teams or token holder votes, and is thus prone to human bias and financial risks, undermining the system's integrity and security. While existing efforts aim to establish more adaptive parameter adjustment schemes, there remains a need for a governance model that is both more efficient and resilient to significant market manipulations. In this paper, we introduce "Auto.gov", a learning-based governance framework that employs a deep Q-network (DQN) reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to perform semi-automated, data-driven parameter adjustments. We create a DeFi environment with an encoded action-state space akin to the Aave lending protocol for simulation and testing purposes, where Auto.gov has demonstrated the capability to retain funds that would have otherwise been lost to price oracle attacks. In tests with real-world data, Auto.gov outperforms the benchmark approaches by at least 14% and the static baseline model by tenfold, in terms of the preset performance metric-protocol profitability. Overall, the comprehensive evaluations confirm that Auto.gov is more efficient and effective than traditional governance methods, thereby enhancing the security, profitability, and ultimately, the sustainability of DeFi protocols.</description>

      <title>Model Cascading for Code: A Cascaded Black-Box Multi-Model Framework for Cost-Efficient Code Completion with Self-Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved code completion tasks, yet the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost remains a critical challenge. While using larger models and incorporating inference-time self-testing algorithms can significantly improve output accuracy, they incur substantial computational expenses at the same time. Furthermore, servers in real-world scenarios usually have a dynamic preference on the cost-accuracy tradeoff, depending on the budget, bandwidth, the concurrent user volume, and users' sensitivity to wrong answers. In this work, we introduce a novel framework combining model cascading and inference-time self-feedback algorithms to find multiple near-optimal self-testing options on the cost-accuracy tradeoff in LLM-based code generation. Our approach leverages self-generated tests to both enhance accuracy and evaluate model cascading decisions. As a blackbox inference-time method, it requires no access to internal model parameters. We further propose a threshold-based algorithm to determine when to deploy larger models and a heuristic to optimize the number of solutions, test cases, and test lines generated per model, based on budget constraints. Experimental results show that our cascading approach reduces costs by an average of 26%, and up to 70% in the best case, across various model families and datasets, while maintaining or improving accuracy in natural language generation tasks compared to both random and optimal single-model self-testing schemes. To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a series of choices for optimizing the cost-accuracy trade-off in LLM code generation with self-testing.</description>

      <title>Shield Synthesis for LTL Modulo Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) models have achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, these models also tend to demonstrate unsafe behaviors, precluding their deployment in safety-critical systems. To cope with this issue, ample research focuses on developing methods that guarantee the safe behaviour of a given ML model. A prominent example is shielding which incorporates an external component (a ``shield'') that blocks unwanted behavior. Despite significant progress, shielding suffers from a main setback: it is currently geared towards properties encoded solely in propositional logics (e.g., LTL) and is unsuitable for richer logics. This, in turn, limits the widespread applicability of shielding in many real-world systems. In this work, we address this gap, and extend shielding to LTL modulo theories, by building upon recent advances in reactive synthesis modulo theories. This allowed us to develop a novel approach for generating shields conforming to complex safety specifications in these more expressive, logics. We evaluated our shields and demonstrate their ability to handle rich data with temporal dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach for synthesizing shields for such expressivity.</description>

      <title>RePrompt: Planning by Automatic Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past year, large language models (LLMs) have had remarkable success in domains outside the traditional natural language processing, and their capacity is further expanded into the so-called LLM agents when connected with external tools. In all domains, the prompt to the LLMs has been shown to make a big difference in what the LLM would generate and thus affect the performance of the LLM agents. Therefore, automatic prompt engineering (APE) has become an important question for many researchers and users of LLMs. However, previous works in APE rely on a final checker to evaluate the performance of the given prompt -- a requirement that is hard to meet in the case of LLM agents, where intermediate feedback is easier to obtain, and the final evaluation could be expensive, inaccurate, or even missing. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \textsc{RePrompt}, which does a ``gradient descent"-like approach to optimize the step-by-step instructions in the prompts given to LLM agents, based on the chat history obtained from interactions and reflections with LLM agents. By leveraging intermediate feedback, \textsc{RePrompt} can optimize the prompt without the need for a final solution checker. We evaluate our approach on PDDL generation, TravelPlanner, and Meeting Planning to show that our method could generally improve performance for different reasoning tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of cardiorespiratory auscultation sensing devices (i.e., stethoscopes), which is useful for understanding the theoretical aspects and practical design notes. In this paper, we first introduce the acoustic properties of the heart and lungs, as well as a brief history of stethoscope evolution. Then, we discuss the basic concept of electret condenser microphones (ECMs) and a stethoscope based on them. Then, we discuss the microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) technology, particularly focusing on piezoelectric transducer sensors. This paper comprehensively reviews sensing technologies for cardiorespiratory auscultation, emphasizing MEMS-based wearable designs in the past decade. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to summarize ECM and MEMS applications for heart and lung sound analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of creating a neural architecture for very long sequences that requires constant time for processing new information at each time step. Our approach, Associative Recurrent Memory Transformer (ARMT), is based on transformer self-attention for local context and segment-level recurrence for storage of task specific information distributed over a long context. We demonstrate that ARMT outperfors existing alternatives in associative retrieval tasks and sets a new performance record in the recent BABILong multi-task long-context benchmark by answering single-fact questions over 50 million tokens with an accuracy of 79.9%. The source code for training and evaluation is available on github.</description>

      <title>Hedge Fund Portfolio Construction Using PolyModel Theory and iTransformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When constructing portfolios, a key problem is that a lot of financial time series data are sparse, making it challenging to apply machine learning methods. Polymodel theory can solve this issue and demonstrate superiority in portfolio construction from various aspects. To implement the PolyModel theory for constructing a hedge fund portfolio, we begin by identifying an asset pool, utilizing over 10,000 hedge funds for the past 29 years' data. PolyModel theory also involves choosing a wide-ranging set of risk factors, which includes various financial indices, currencies, and commodity prices. This comprehensive selection mirrors the complexities of the real-world environment. Leveraging on the PolyModel theory, we create quantitative measures such as Long-term Alpha, Long-term Ratio, and SVaR. We also use more classical measures like the Sharpe ratio or Morningstar's MRAR. To enhance the performance of the constructed portfolio, we also employ the latest deep learning techniques (iTransformer) to capture the upward trend, while efficiently controlling the downside, using all the features. The iTransformer model is specifically designed to address the challenges in high-dimensional time series forecasting and could largely improve our strategies. More precisely, our strategies achieve better Sharpe ratio and annualized return. The above process enables us to create multiple portfolio strategies aiming for high returns and low risks when compared to various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>CrossFi: A Cross Domain Wi-Fi Sensing Framework Based on Siamese Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Wi-Fi sensing has garnered significant attention due to its numerous benefits, such as privacy protection, low cost, and penetration ability. Extensive research has been conducted in this field, focusing on areas such as gesture recognition, people identification, and fall detection. However, many data-driven methods encounter challenges related to domain shift, where the model fails to perform well in environments different from the training data. One major factor contributing to this issue is the limited availability of Wi-Fi sensing datasets, which makes models learn excessive irrelevant information and over-fit to the training set. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale Wi-Fi sensing datasets across diverse scenarios is a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose CrossFi, a siamese network-based approach that excels in both in-domain scenario and cross-domain scenario, including few-shot, zero-shot scenarios, and even works in few-shot new-class scenario where testing set contains new categories. The core component of CrossFi is a sample-similarity calculation network called CSi-Net, which improves the structure of the siamese network by using an attention mechanism to capture similarity information, instead of simply calculating the distance or cosine similarity. Based on it, we develop an extra Weight-Net that can generate a template for each class, so that our CrossFi can work in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our CrossFi achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. In gesture recognition task, our CrossFi achieves an accuracy of 98.17% in in-domain scenario, 91.72% in one-shot cross-domain scenario, 64.81% in zero-shot cross-domain scenario, and 84.75% in one-shot new-class scenario. The code for our model is publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/CrossFi.</description>

      <title>Application of Langevin Dynamics to Advance the Quantum Natural Gradient Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) algorithm for optimization of variational quantum circuits has been proposed recently. In this study, we employ the Langevin equation with a QNG stochastic force to demonstrate that its discrete-time solution gives a generalized form of the above-specified algorithm, which we call Momentum-QNG. Similar to other optimization algorithms with the momentum term, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum, RMSProp with momentum and Adam, Momentum-QNG is more effective to escape local minima and plateaus in the variational parameter space and, therefore, achieves a better convergence behavior compared to the basic QNG. In this paper we benchmark Momentum-QNG together with basic QNG, Adam and Momentum optimizers and find the optimal values of its hyperparameters. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/borbysh/Momentum-QNG</description>

      <title>SurgPLAN++: Universal Surgical Phase Localization Network for Online and Offline Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surgical phase recognition is critical for assisting surgeons in understanding surgical videos. Existing studies focused more on online surgical phase recognition, by leveraging preceding frames to predict the current frame. Despite great progress, they formulated the task as a series of frame-wise classification, which resulted in a lack of global context of the entire procedure and incoherent predictions. Moreover, besides online analysis, accurate offline surgical phase recognition is also in significant clinical need for retrospective analysis, and existing online algorithms do not fully analyze the entire video, thereby limiting accuracy in offline analysis. To overcome these challenges and enhance both online and offline inference capabilities, we propose a universal Surgical Phase Localization Network, named SurgPLAN++, with the principle of temporal detection. To ensure a global understanding of the surgical procedure, we devise a phase localization strategy for SurgPLAN++ to predict phase segments across the entire video through phase proposals. For online analysis, to generate high-quality phase proposals, SurgPLAN++ incorporates a data augmentation strategy to extend the streaming video into a pseudo-complete video through mirroring, center-duplication, and down-sampling. For offline analysis, SurgPLAN++ capitalizes on its global phase prediction framework to continuously refine preceding predictions during each online inference step, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of phase recognition. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, and our SurgPLAN++ achieves remarkable performance in both online and offline modes, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Programming Every Example: Lifting Pre-training Data Quality Like Experts at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, FineWeb, FineWeb-Edu, and DCLM. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training. We are open-sourcing ProX with &gt;500B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation.

      <title>URIEL+: Enhancing Linguistic Inclusion and Usability in a Typological and Multilingual Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: URIEL is a knowledge base offering geographical, phylogenetic, and typological vector representations for 7970 languages. It includes distance measures between these vectors for 4005 languages, which are accessible via the lang2vec tool. Despite being frequently cited, URIEL is limited in terms of linguistic inclusion and overall usability. To tackle these challenges, we introduce URIEL+, an enhanced version of URIEL and lang2vec that addresses these limitations. In addition to expanding typological feature coverage for 2898 languages, URIEL+ improves the user experience with robust, customizable distance calculations to better suit the needs of users. These upgrades also offer competitive performance on downstream tasks and provide distances that better align with linguistic distance studies.</description>

      <title>Learning Strategy Representation for Imitation Learning in Multi-Agent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The offline datasets for imitation learning (IL) in multi-agent games typically contain player trajectories exhibiting diverse strategies, which necessitate measures to prevent learning algorithms from acquiring undesirable behaviors. Learning representations for these trajectories is an effective approach to depicting the strategies employed by each demonstrator. However, existing learning strategies often require player identification or rely on strong assumptions, which are not appropriate for multi-agent games. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the Strategy Representation for Imitation Learning (STRIL) framework, which (1) effectively learns strategy representations in multi-agent games, (2) estimates proposed indicators based on these representations, and (3) filters out sub-optimal data using the indicators. STRIL is a plug-in method that can be integrated into existing IL algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STRIL across competitive multi-agent scenarios, including Two-player Pong, Limit Texas Hold'em, and Connect Four. Our approach successfully acquires strategy representations and indicators, thereby identifying dominant trajectories and significantly enhancing existing IL performance across these environments.</description>

      <title>CR-CTC: Consistency regularization on CTC for improved speech recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05101v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is a widely used method for automatic speech recognition (ASR), renowned for its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, it often falls short in recognition performance. In this work, we propose the Consistency-Regularized CTC (CR-CTC), which enforces consistency between two CTC distributions obtained from different augmented views of the input speech mel-spectrogram. We provide in-depth insights into its essential behaviors from three perspectives: 1) it conducts self-distillation between random pairs of sub-models that process different augmented views; 2) it learns contextual representation through masked prediction for positions within time-masked regions, especially when we increase the amount of time masking; 3) it suppresses the extremely peaky CTC distributions, thereby reducing overfitting and improving the generalization ability. Extensive experiments on LibriSpeech, Aishell-1, and GigaSpeech datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CR-CTC. It significantly improves the CTC performance, achieving state-of-the-art results comparable to those attained by transducer or systems combining CTC and attention-based encoder-decoder (CTC/AED). We release our code at https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall.</description>

      <title>Exploring Channel Distinguishability in Local Neighborhoods of the Model Space in Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing interest in Quantum Machine Learning, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have emerged and gained significant attention. These models have, however, been shown to be notoriously difficult to train, which we hypothesize is partially due to the architectures, called ansatzes, that are hardly studied at this point. Therefore, in this paper, we take a step back and analyze ansatzes. We initially consider their expressivity, i.e., the space of operations they are able to express, and show that the closeness to being a 2-design, the primarily used measure, fails at capturing this property. Hence, we look for alternative ways to characterize ansatzes by considering the local neighborhood of the model space, in particular, analyzing model distinguishability upon small perturbation of parameters. We derive an upper bound on their distinguishability, showcasing that QNNs with few parameters are hardly discriminable upon update. Our numerical experiments support our bounds and further indicate that there is a significant degree of variability, which stresses the need for warm-starting or clever initialization. Altogether, our work provides an ansatz-centric perspective on training dynamics and difficulties in QNNs, ultimately suggesting that iterative training of small quantum models may not be effective, which contrasts their initial motivation.</description>

      <title>DR-MPC: Deep Residual Model Predictive Control for Real-world Social Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can a robot safely navigate around people with complex motion patterns? Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in simulation holds some promise, but much prior work relies on simulators that fail to capture the nuances of real human motion. Thus, we propose Deep Residual Model Predictive Control (DR-MPC) to enable robots to quickly and safely perform DRL from real-world crowd navigation data. By blending MPC with model-free DRL, DR-MPC overcomes the DRL challenges of large data requirements and unsafe initial behavior. DR-MPC is initialized with MPC-based path tracking, and gradually learns to interact more effectively with humans. To further accelerate learning, a safety component estimates out-of-distribution states to guide the robot away from likely collisions. In simulation, we show that DR-MPC substantially outperforms prior work, including traditional DRL and residual DRL models. Hardware experiments show our approach successfully enables a robot to navigate a variety of crowded situations with few errors using less than 4 hours of training data.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Model-based Reinforcement Learning using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their applications in areas extending well beyond natural language processing tasks. In reinforcement learning, while LLMs have been extensively used in text-based environments, their integration with continuous state spaces remains understudied. In this paper, we investigate how pre-trained LLMs can be leveraged to predict in context the dynamics of continuous Markov decision processes. We identify handling multivariate data and incorporating the control signal as key challenges that limit the potential of LLMs' deployment in this setup and propose Disentangled In-Context Learning (DICL) to address them. We present proof-of-concept applications in two reinforcement learning settings: model-based policy evaluation and data-augmented off-policy reinforcement learning, supported by theoretical analysis of the proposed methods. Our experiments further demonstrate that our approach produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/dicl.</description>

      <title>The shape of the brain's connections is predictive of cognitive performance: an explainable machine learning study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shape of the brain's white matter connections is relatively unexplored in diffusion MRI tractography analysis. While it is known that tract shape varies in populations and across the human lifespan, it is unknown if the variability in dMRI tractography-derived shape may relate to the brain's functional variability across individuals. This work explores the potential of leveraging tractography fiber cluster shape measures to predict subject-specific cognitive performance. We implement machine learning models to predict individual cognitive performance scores. We study a large-scale database from the HCP-YA study. We apply an atlas-based fiber cluster parcellation to the dMRI tractography of each individual. We compute 15 shape, microstructure, and connectivity features for each fiber cluster. Using these features as input, we train a total of 210 models to predict 7 different NIH Toolbox cognitive performance assessments. We apply an explainable AI technique, SHAP, to assess the importance of each fiber cluster for prediction. Our results demonstrate that shape measures are predictive of individual cognitive performance. The studied shape measures, such as irregularity, diameter, total surface area, volume, and branch volume, are as effective for prediction as microstructure and connectivity measures. The overall best-performing feature is a shape feature, irregularity, which describes how different a cluster's shape is from an idealized cylinder. Further interpretation using SHAP values suggest that fiber clusters with features highly predictive of cognitive ability are widespread throughout the brain, including fiber clusters from the superficial association, deep association, cerebellar, striatal, and projection pathways. This study demonstrates the strong potential of shape descriptors to enhance the study of the brain's white matter and its relationship to cognitive function.</description>

      <title>Generative Models, Humans, Predictive Models: Who Is Worse at High-Stakes Decision Making?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite strong advisory against it, large generative models (LMs) are already being used for decision making tasks that were previously done by predictive models or humans. We put popular LMs to the test in a high-stakes decision making task: recidivism prediction. Studying three closed-access and open-source LMs, we analyze the LMs not exclusively in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of agreement with (imperfect, noisy, and sometimes biased) human predictions or existing predictive models. We conduct experiments that assess how providing different types of information, including distractor information such as photos, can influence LM decisions. We also stress test techniques designed to either increase accuracy or mitigate bias in LMs, and find that some to have unintended consequences on LM decisions. Our results provide additional quantitative evidence to the wisdom that current LMs are not the right tools for these types of tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Complexity of Estimating Vendi Scores from Empirical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the diversity of generative models without access to reference data poses methodological challenges. The reference-free Vendi score offers a solution by quantifying the diversity of generated data using matrix-based entropy measures. The Vendi score is usually computed via the eigendecomposition of an $n \times n$ kernel matrix for $n$ generated samples. However, the heavy computational cost of eigendecomposition for large $n$ often limits the sample size used in practice to a few tens of thousands. In this paper, we investigate the statistical convergence of the Vendi score. We numerically demonstrate that for kernel functions with an infinite feature map dimension, the score estimated from a limited sample size may exhibit a non-negligible bias relative to the population Vendi score, i.e., the asymptotic limit as the sample size approaches infinity. To address this, we introduce a truncation of the Vendi statistic, called the $t$-truncated Vendi statistic, which is guaranteed to converge to its asymptotic limit given $n=O(t)$ samples. We show that the existing Nystr\"om method and the FKEA approximation method for approximating the Vendi score both converge to the population truncated Vendi score. We perform several numerical experiments to illustrate the concentration of the Nystr\"om and FKEA-computed Vendi scores around the truncated Vendi and discuss how the truncated Vendi score correlates with the diversity of image and text data.</description>

      <title>MassSpecGym: A benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery and identification of molecules in biological and environmental samples is crucial for advancing biomedical and chemical sciences. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the leading technique for high-throughput elucidation of molecular structures. However, decoding a molecular structure from its mass spectrum is exceptionally challenging, even when performed by human experts. As a result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes. Despite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting molecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is severely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols. To address this problem, we propose MassSpecGym -- the first comprehensive benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules from MS/MS data. Our benchmark comprises the largest publicly available collection of high-quality labeled MS/MS spectra and defines three MS/MS annotation challenges: de novo molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. It includes new evaluation metrics and a generalization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS annotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine learning community. MassSpecGym is publicly available at https://github.com/pluskal-lab/MassSpecGym.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the proximal operator defined through a convex combination of convex objectives, where the coefficients are updated in a minimax fashion. We prove that this new operator is Bregman firmly nonexpansive with respect to a Bregman divergence that combines Euclidean and information geometries. Finally, we derive the associated continuous flows.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference on the Boolean Hypercube with the Quantum Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive variational inference upper-bounds on the log-partition function of pairwise Markov random fields on the Boolean hypercube, based on quantum relaxations of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We then propose an efficient algorithm to compute these bounds based on primal-dual optimization. An improvement of these bounds through the use of ''hierarchies,'' similar to sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchies is proposed, and we present a greedy algorithm to select among these relaxations. We carry extensive numerical experiments and compare with state-of-the-art methods for this inference problem.</description>

      <title>SequentialBreak: Large Language Models Can be Fooled by Embedding Jailbreak Prompts into Sequential Prompt Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the integration of the Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications increases, so does their susceptibility to misuse, raising significant security concerns. Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to assess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks mainly rely on scenario camouflage, prompt obfuscation, prompt optimization, and prompt iterative optimization to conceal malicious prompts. In particular, sequential prompt chains in a single query can lead LLMs to focus on certain prompts while ignoring others, facilitating context manipulation. This paper introduces SequentialBreak, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits this vulnerability. We discuss several scenarios, not limited to examples like Question Bank, Dialog Completion, and Game Environment, where the harmful prompt is embedded within benign ones that can fool LLMs into generating harmful responses. The distinct narrative structures of these scenarios show that SequentialBreak is flexible enough to adapt to various prompt formats beyond those discussed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SequentialBreak uses only a single query to achieve a substantial gain of attack success rate over existing baselines against both open-source and closed-source models. Through our research, we highlight the urgent need for more robust and resilient safeguards to enhance LLM security and prevent potential misuse.

      <title>Anti-Forgetting Adaptation for Unsupervised Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regular unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (ReID) focuses on adapting a model from a source domain to a fixed target domain. However, an adapted ReID model can hardly retain previously-acquired knowledge and generalize to unseen data. In this paper, we propose a Dual-level Joint Adaptation and Anti-forgetting (DJAA) framework, which incrementally adapts a model to new domains without forgetting source domain and each adapted target domain. We explore the possibility of using prototype and instance-level consistency to mitigate the forgetting during the adaptation. Specifically, we store a small number of representative image samples and corresponding cluster prototypes in a memory buffer, which is updated at each adaptation step. With the buffered images and prototypes, we regularize the image-to-image similarity and image-to-prototype similarity to rehearse old knowledge. After the multi-step adaptation, the model is tested on all seen domains and several unseen domains to validate the generalization ability of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the anti-forgetting, generalization and backward-compatible ability of an unsupervised person ReID model.</description>

      <title>Improving Next Tokens via Second-to-Last Predictions with Generate and Refine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive language models like GPT aim to predict next tokens, while autoencoding models such as BERT are trained on tasks such as predicting masked tokens. We train a decoder-only architecture for predicting the second to last token for a sequence of tokens. Our approach yields higher computational training efficiency than BERT-style models by employing a structured deterministic approach to masking tokens. We use our model to improve the next token predictions of a standard GPT by combining both predictions in a ``generate-then-refine'' approach. We demonstrate on different variants of GPT-2 and different datasets that (not unexpectedly) second to last token predictions are much more accurate, i.e., more than 15\% higher accuracy than standard next token predictions. The ``generate-then-refine'' approach also demonstrates notable improvements in next-token predictions, yielding smaller yet consistent and significant gains.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Automated Segmentation of Perivascular Spaces in Brain MRI with the nnU-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Enlargement of perivascular spaces (PVS) is common in neurodegenerative disorders including cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. PVS enlargement may indicate impaired clearance pathways and there is a need for reliable PVS detection methods which are currently lacking. Aim: To optimise a widely used deep learning model, the no-new-UNet (nnU-Net), for PVS segmentation. Methods: In 30 healthy participants (mean$\pm$SD age: 50$\pm$18.9 years; 13 females), T1-weighted MRI images were acquired using three different protocols on three MRI scanners (3T Siemens Tim Trio, 3T Philips Achieva, and 7T Siemens Magnetom). PVS were manually segmented across ten axial slices in each participant. Segmentations were completed using a sparse annotation strategy. In total, 11 models were compared using various strategies for image handling, preprocessing and semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross validation (5FCV). The main performance metric was the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results: The voxel-spacing agnostic model (mean$\pm$SD DSC=64.3$\pm$3.3%) outperformed models which resampled images to a common resolution (DSC=40.5-55%). Model performance improved substantially following iterative label cleaning (DSC=85.7$\pm$1.2%). Semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels (n=12,740) from 18 additional datasets improved the agreement between raw and predicted PVS cluster counts (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient=0.89, 95%CI=0.82-0.94). We extended the model to enable PVS segmentation in the midbrain (DSC=64.3$\pm$6.5%) and hippocampus (DSC=67.8$\pm$5%). Conclusions: Our deep learning models provide a robust and holistic framework for the automated quantification of PVS in brain MRI.</description>

      <title>MQFL-FHE: Multimodal Quantum Federated Learning Framework with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem involving the reconstruction of the solution to a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) with unknown boundary conditions. Instead of direct boundary data, we are provided with a large dataset of boundary observations for typical solutions (collective data) and a bulk measurement of a specific realization. To leverage this collective data, we first compress the boundary data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in a linear expansion. Next, we identify a possible nonlinear low-dimensional structure in the expansion coefficients using an autoencoder, which provides a parametrization of the dataset in a lower-dimensional latent space. We then train an operator network to map the expansion coefficients representing the boundary data to the finite element solution of the PDE. Finally, we connect the autoencoder's decoder to the operator network which enables us to solve the inverse problem by optimizing a data-fitting term over the latent space. We analyze the underlying stabilized finite element method in the linear setting and establish an optimal error estimate in the $H^1$-norm. The nonlinear problem is then studied numerically, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>What You See Is Not Always What You Get: An Empirical Study of Code Comprehension by Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering tasks, including code generation and comprehension. While LLMs have shown significant potential in assisting with coding, it is perceived that LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of LLMs to imperceptible attacks, where hidden character manipulation in source code misleads LLMs' behaviour while remaining undetectable to human reviewers. We devise these attacks into four distinct categories and analyse their impacts on code analysis and comprehension tasks. These four types of imperceptible coding character attacks include coding reordering, invisible coding characters, code deletions, and code homoglyphs. To comprehensively benchmark the robustness of current LLMs solutions against the attacks, we present a systematic experimental evaluation on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our experimental design introduces two key performance metrics, namely model confidence using log probabilities of response, and the response correctness. A set of controlled experiments are conducted using a large-scale perturbed and unperturbed code snippets as the primary prompt input. Our findings confirm the susceptibility of LLMs to imperceptible coding character attacks, while different LLMs present different negative correlations between perturbation magnitude and performance. These results highlight the urgent need for robust LLMs capable of manoeuvring behaviours under imperceptible adversarial conditions. We anticipate this work provides valuable insights for enhancing the security and trustworthiness of LLMs in software engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial for safeguarding digital infrastructure. In dynamic network environments, both threat landscapes and normal operational behaviors are constantly changing, resulting in concept drift. While continuous learning mitigates the adverse effects of concept drift, insufficient attention to drift patterns and excessive preservation of outdated knowledge can still hinder the IDS's adaptability. In this paper, we propose SSF (Strategic Selection and Forgetting), a novel continual learning method for IDS, providing continuous model updates with a constantly refreshed memory buffer. Our approach features a strategic sample selection algorithm to select representative new samples and a strategic forgetting mechanism to drop outdated samples. The proposed strategic sample selection algorithm prioritizes new samples that cause the `drifted' pattern, enabling the model to better understand the evolving landscape. Additionally, we introduce strategic forgetting upon detecting significant drift by discarding outdated samples to free up memory, allowing the incorporation of more recent data. SSF captures evolving patterns effectively and ensures the model is aligned with the change of data patterns, significantly enhancing the IDS's adaptability to concept drift. The state-of-the-art performance of SSF on NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets demonstrates its superior adaptability to concept drift for network intrusion detection.

      <title>ArchComplete: Autoregressive 3D Architectural Design Generation with Hierarchical Diffusion-Based Upsampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generative models have shown promising results but often fall short in capturing the complexity of architectural geometries and topologies and fine geometric details at high resolutions. To tackle this, we present ArchComplete, a two-stage voxel-based 3D generative pipeline consisting of a vector-quantised model, whose composition is modelled with an autoregressive transformer for generating coarse shapes, followed by a hierarchical upsampling strategy for further enrichment with fine structures and details. Key to our pipeline is (i) learning a contextually rich codebook of local patch embeddings, optimised alongside a 2.5D perceptual loss that captures global spatial correspondence of projections onto three axis-aligned orthogonal planes, and (ii) redefining upsampling as a set of conditional diffusion models learning from a hierarchy of randomly cropped coarse-to-fine local volumetric patches. Trained on our introduced dataset of 3D house models with fully modelled exterior and interior, ArchComplete autoregressively generates models at the resolution of $64^{3}$ and progressively refines them up to $512^{3}$, with voxel sizes as small as $ \approx 9\text{cm}$. ArchComplete solves a variety of tasks, including genetic interpolation and variation, unconditional synthesis, shape and plan-drawing completion, as well as geometric detailisation, while achieving state-of-the-art performance in quality, diversity, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>GroverGPT: A Large Language Model with 8 Billion Parameters for Quantum Searching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00135v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting non-Von Neumann paradigm, offering provable speedups over classical computing for specific problems. However, the practical limits of classical simulatability for quantum circuits remain unclear, especially with current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the output of a quantum Turing machine using Grover's quantum circuits, known to provide quadratic speedups over classical counterparts. To this end, we developed GroverGPT, a specialized model based on LLaMA's 8-billion-parameter architecture, trained on over 15 trillion tokens. Unlike brute-force state-vector simulations, which demand substantial computational resources, GroverGPT employs pattern recognition to approximate quantum search algorithms without explicitly representing quantum states. Analyzing 97K quantum search instances, GroverGPT consistently outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o (45\% accuracy), achieving nearly 100\% accuracy on 6- and 10-qubit datasets when trained on 4-qubit or larger datasets. It also demonstrated strong generalization, surpassing 95\% accuracy for systems with over 20 qubits when trained on 3- to 6-qubit data. Analysis indicates GroverGPT captures quantum features of Grover's search rather than classical patterns, supported by novel prompting strategies to enhance performance. Although accuracy declines with increasing system size, these findings offer insights into the practical boundaries of classical simulatability. This work suggests task-specific LLMs can surpass general-purpose models like GPT-4o in quantum algorithm learning and serve as powerful tools for advancing quantum research.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation for Dynamic Few-shot Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text classification is a fundamental task in data mining, pivotal to various applications such as tabular understanding and recommendation. Although neural network-based models, such as CNN and BERT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in text classification, their effectiveness heavily relies on abundant labeled training data. This dependency makes these models less effective in dynamic few-shot text classification, where labeled data is scarce, and new target labels frequently appear based on application needs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their extensive pretraining and contextual understanding ability. Current approaches provide LLMs with text inputs, candidate labels, and additional side information (e.g., descriptions) to classify texts. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the increased input size and the noise introduced through side information processing. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-based online retrieval-augmented generation framework, namely GORAG, for dynamic few-shot text classification. Rather than treating each input independently, GORAG constructs and maintains a weighted graph by extracting side information across all target texts. In this graph, text keywords and labels are represented as nodes, with edges indicating the correlations between them. To model these correlations, GORAG employs an edge weighting mechanism to prioritize the importance and reliability of extracted information and dynamically retrieves relevant context using a minimum-cost spanning tree tailored for each text input. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GORAG outperforms existing approaches by providing more comprehensive and precise contextual information.</description>

      <title>Data Center Cooling System Optimization Using Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence have fueled a rapid expansion of the data center (DC) industry worldwide, accompanied by an immense appetite for electricity to power the DCs. In a typical DC, around 30~40% of the energy is spent on the cooling system rather than on computer servers, posing a pressing need for developing new energy-saving optimization technologies for DC cooling systems. However, optimizing such real-world industrial systems faces numerous challenges, including but not limited to a lack of reliable simulation environments, limited historical data, and stringent safety and control robustness requirements. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework for energy efficiency optimization of DC cooling systems. The proposed framework models the complex dynamical patterns and physical dependencies inside a server room using a purposely designed graph neural network architecture that is compliant with the fundamental time-reversal symmetry. Because of its well-behaved and generalizable state-action representations, the model enables sample-efficient and robust latent space offline policy learning using limited real-world operational data. Our framework has been successfully deployed and verified in a large-scale production DC for closed-loop control of its air-cooling units (ACUs). We conducted a total of 2000 hours of short and long-term experiments in the production DC environment. The results show that our method achieves 14~21% energy savings in the DC cooling system, without any violation of the safety or operational constraints. Our results have demonstrated the significant potential of offline RL in solving a broad range of data-limited, safety-critical real-world industrial control problems.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and Boosting the Power of Fine-Grained Visual Recognition for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in various visual understanding tasks. However, MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR), which aims to identify subordinate-level categories from images. This can negatively impact more advanced capabilities of MLLMs, such as object-centric visual question answering and reasoning. In our study, we revisit three quintessential capabilities of MLLMs for FGVR, including object information extraction, category knowledge reserve, object-category alignment, and position of the root cause as a misalignment problem. To address this issue, we present Finedefics, an MLLM that enhances the model's FGVR capability by incorporating informative attribute descriptions of objects into the training phase. We employ contrastive learning on object-attribute pairs and attribute-category pairs simultaneously and use examples from similar but incorrect categories as hard negatives, naturally bringing representations of visual objects and category names closer. Extensive evaluations across multiple popular FGVR datasets demonstrate that Finedefics outperforms existing MLLMs of comparable parameter sizes, showcasing its remarkable efficacy. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ICST-MIPL/Finedefics_ICLR2025.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Channel Access and Transmission for NR Sidelink and Wi-Fi Coexistence over Unlicensed Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of various internet of things (IoT) applications, including industrial IoT (IIoT) and visual IoT (VIoT), the demand for direct device-to-device communication to support high data rates continues to grow. To address this demand, 5G-Advanced has introduced sidelink communication over the unlicensed spectrum (SL-U) to increase data rates. However, the primary challenge of SL-U in the unlicensed spectrum is ensuring fair coexistence with other incumbent systems, such as Wi-Fi. In this paper, we address the challenge by designing channel access mechanisms and power control strategies to mitigate interference and ensure fair coexistence. First, we propose a novel collaborative channel access (CCHA) mechanism that integrates channel access with resource allocation through collaborative interactions between base stations (BS) and SL-U users. This mechanism ensures fair coexistence with incumbent systems while improving resource utilization. Second, to further enhance the performance of the coexistence system, we develop a cooperative subgoal-based hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (C-GHDRL) algorithm framework. The framework enables SL-U users to make globally optimal decisions by leveraging cooperative operations between the BS and SL-U users, effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional optimization methods in solving joint optimization problems with nonlinear constraints. Finally, we mathematically model the joint channel access and power control problem and balance the trade-off between fairness and transmission rate in the coexistence system by defining a suitable reward function in the C-GHDRL algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances the performance of the coexistence system while ensuring fair coexistence between SL-U and Wi-Fi users.</description>

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to mimic expert behavior without reward signals but faces challenges in cross-domain scenarios with high-dimensional, noisy, and incomplete visual observations. To address this, we propose Domain-Invariant Per-Frame Feature Extraction for Imitation Learning (DIFF-IL), a novel IL method that extracts domain-invariant features from individual frames and adapts them into sequences to isolate and replicate expert behaviors. We also introduce a frame-wise time labeling technique to segment expert behaviors by timesteps and assign rewards aligned with temporal contexts, enhancing task performance. Experiments across diverse visual environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DIFF-IL in addressing complex visual tasks.</description>

      <title>DiTAR: Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling for Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.</description>

      <title>A Regularized Newton Method for Nonconvex Optimization with Global and Local Complexity Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point of a nonconvex function with a Lipschitz continuous Hessian and propose a quadratic regularized Newton method incorporating a new class of regularizers constructed from the current and previous gradients. The method leverages a recently developed linear conjugate gradient approach with a negative curvature monitor to solve the regularized Newton equation. Notably, our algorithm is adaptive, requiring no prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, and achieves a global complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-\frac{3}{2}}) + \tilde O(1)$ in terms of the second-order oracle calls, and $\tilde O(\epsilon^{-\frac{7}{4}})$ for Hessian-vector products, respectively. Moreover, when the iterates converge to a point where the Hessian is positive definite, the method exhibits quadratic local convergence. Preliminary numerical results illustrate the competitiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Devil is in the Prompts: De-Identification Traces Enhance Memorization Risks in Synthetic Chest X-Ray Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models, particularly text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, play a crucial role in medical image analysis. However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals two unexpected findings: (1) prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures (markers introduced to hide Protected Health Information) are the most memorized, and (2) among all tokens, de-identification markers contribute the most towards memorization. This highlights a broader issue with the standard anonymization practices and T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. To exacerbate, existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens. On this front, we propose actionable strategies for different stakeholders to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results provide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking memorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset. The anonymized code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/diffusion_memorization-8011/</description>

      <title>COMBO-Grasp: Learning Constraint-Based Manipulation for Bimanual Occluded Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of occluded robot grasping, i.e. grasping in situations where the desired grasp poses are kinematically infeasible due to environmental constraints such as surface collisions. Traditional robot manipulation approaches struggle with the complexity of non-prehensile or bimanual strategies commonly used by humans in these circumstances. State-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods are unsuitable due to the inherent complexity of the task. In contrast, learning from demonstration requires collecting a significant number of expert demonstrations, which is often infeasible. Instead, inspired by human bimanual manipulation strategies, where two hands coordinate to stabilise and reorient objects, we focus on a bimanual robotic setup to tackle this challenge. In particular, we introduce Constraint-based Manipulation for Bimanual Occluded Grasping (COMBO-Grasp), a learning-based approach which leverages two coordinated policies: a constraint policy trained using self-supervised datasets to generate stabilising poses and a grasping policy trained using RL that reorients and grasps the target object. A key contribution lies in value function-guided policy coordination. Specifically, during RL training for the grasping policy, the constraint policy's output is refined through gradients from a jointly trained value function, improving bimanual coordination and task performance. Lastly, COMBO-Grasp employs teacher-student policy distillation to effectively deploy point cloud-based policies in real-world environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that COMBO-Grasp significantly improves task success rates compared to competitive baseline approaches, with successful generalisation to unseen objects in both simulated and real-world environments.</description>

      <title>TRISHUL: Towards Region Identification and Screen Hierarchy Understanding for Large VLM based GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled the development of LVLM-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents under various paradigms. Training-based approaches, such as CogAgent and SeeClick, struggle with cross-dataset and cross-platform generalization due to their reliance on dataset-specific training. Generalist LVLMs, such as GPT-4V, employ Set-of-Marks (SoM) for action grounding, but obtaining SoM labels requires metadata like HTML source, which is not consistently available across platforms. Moreover, existing methods often specialize in singular GUI tasks rather than achieving comprehensive GUI understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce TRISHUL, a novel, training-free agentic framework that enhances generalist LVLMs for holistic GUI comprehension. Unlike prior works that focus on either action grounding (mapping instructions to GUI elements) or GUI referring (describing GUI elements given a location), TRISHUL seamlessly integrates both. At its core, TRISHUL employs Hierarchical Screen Parsing (HSP) and the Spatially Enhanced Element Description (SEED) module, which work synergistically to provide multi-granular, spatially, and semantically enriched representations of GUI elements. Our results demonstrate TRISHUL's superior performance in action grounding across the ScreenSpot, VisualWebBench, AITW, and Mind2Web datasets. Additionally, for GUI referring, TRISHUL surpasses the ToL agent on the ScreenPR benchmark, setting a new standard for robust and adaptable GUI comprehension.</description>

Among these, graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at extracting higher-order structural information, while large language models (LLMs) are designed to process and comprehend natural language, making both approaches highly effective and widely adopted. Recent research has focused on graph foundation models (GFMs), which integrate the strengths of GNNs and LLMs to model complex RS problems more efficiently by leveraging the graph-based structure of user-item relationships alongside textual understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GFM-based RS technologies by introducing a clear taxonomy of current approaches, diving into methodological details, and highlighting key challenges and future directions. By synthesizing recent advancements, we aim to offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of GFM-based recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity Simulation-based Inference for Computationally Expensive Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Across many domains of science, stochastic models are an essential tool to understand the mechanisms underlying empirically observed data. Models can be of different levels of detail and accuracy, with models of high-fidelity (i.e., high accuracy) to the phenomena under study being often preferable. However, inferring parameters of high-fidelity models via simulation-based inference is challenging, especially when the simulator is computationally expensive. We introduce MF-NPE, a multifidelity approach to neural posterior estimation that leverages inexpensive low-fidelity simulations to infer parameters of high-fidelity simulators within a limited simulation budget. MF-NPE performs neural posterior estimation with limited high-fidelity resources by virtue of transfer learning, with the ability to prioritize individual observations using active learning. On one statistical task with analytical ground-truth and two real-world tasks, MF-NPE shows comparable performance to current approaches while requiring up to two orders of magnitude fewer high-fidelity simulations. Overall, MF-NPE opens new opportunities to perform efficient Bayesian inference on computationally expensive simulators.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Singular: The Essential Role of Multiple Generations in Effective Benchmark Evaluation and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant utilities in real-world applications, exhibiting impressive capabilities in natural language processing and understanding. Benchmark evaluations are crucial for assessing the capabilities of LLMs as they can provide a comprehensive assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. However, current evaluation methods often overlook the inherent randomness of LLMs by employing deterministic generation strategies or relying on a single random sample, resulting in unaccounted sampling variance and unreliable benchmark score estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical statistical model that provides a more comprehensive representation of the benchmarking process by incorporating both benchmark characteristics and LLM randomness. We show that leveraging multiple generations improves the accuracy of estimating the benchmark score and reduces variance. We also introduce $\mathbb P\left(\text{correct}\right)$, a prompt-level difficulty score based on correct ratios, providing fine-grained insights into individual prompts. Additionally, we create a data map that visualizes difficulty and semantic prompts, enabling error detection and quality control in benchmark construction.</description>

      <title>GEVRM: Goal-Expressive Video Generation Model For Robust Visual Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of embodied artificial intelligence, significant progress has been made in vision-language-action (VLA) models for general robot decision-making. However, the majority of existing VLAs fail to account for the inevitable external perturbations encountered during deployment. These perturbations introduce unforeseen state information to the VLA, resulting in inaccurate actions and consequently, a significant decline in generalization performance. The classic internal model control (IMC) principle demonstrates that a closed-loop system with an internal model that includes external input signals can accurately track the reference input and effectively offset the disturbance. We propose a novel closed-loop VLA method GEVRM that integrates the IMC principle to enhance the robustness of robot visual manipulation. The text-guided video generation model in GEVRM can generate highly expressive future visual planning goals. Simultaneously, we evaluate perturbations by simulating responses, which are called internal embeddings and optimized through prototype contrastive learning. This allows the model to implicitly infer and distinguish perturbations from the external environment. The proposed GEVRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both standard and perturbed CALVIN benchmarks and shows significant improvements in realistic robot tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing GPT for Video Understanding: Zero-Shot Performance and Prompt Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we tackle industry challenges in video content classification by exploring and optimizing GPT-based models for zero-shot classification across seven critical categories of video quality. We contribute a novel approach to improving GPT's performance through prompt optimization and policy refinement, demonstrating that simplifying complex policies significantly reduces false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a new decomposition-aggregation-based prompt engineering technique, which outperforms traditional single-prompt methods. These experiments, conducted on real industry problems, show that thoughtful prompt design can substantially enhance GPT's performance without additional finetuning, offering an effective and scalable solution for improving video classification systems across various domains in industry.</description>
