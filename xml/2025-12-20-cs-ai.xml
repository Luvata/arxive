      <title>Anubuddhi: A Multi-Agent AI System for Designing and Simulating Quantum Optics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Anubuddhi, a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts without requiring specialized programming knowledge. The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.</description>

      <title>The Principle of Proportional Duty: A Knowledge-Duty Framework for Ethical Equilibrium in Human and Artificial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty, treating it as a simple constraint on action. This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).
  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda &gt; 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.
  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.</description>

      <title>Prompt-to-Parts: Generative AI for Physical Assembly and Scalable Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for generating physically realizable assembly instructions from natural language descriptions. Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications. The work proposes a novel elemental lingua franca as a key missing piece from the previous pixel-based diffusion methods or computer-aided design (CAD) models that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange. Across four original designs, this novel "bag of bricks" method thus functions as a physical API: a constrained vocabulary connecting precisely oriented brick locations to a "bag of words" through which arbitrary functional requirements compile into material reality. Given such a consistent and repeatable AI representation opens new design options while guiding natural language implementations in manufacturing and engineering prototyping.</description>

      <title>Emergence: Overcoming Privileged Information Bias in Asymmetric Embodied Agents via Active Querying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) act as powerful reasoning engines but struggle with "symbol grounding" in embodied environments, particularly when information is asymmetrically distributed. We investigate the Privileged Information Bias (or "Curse of Knowledge"), where a knowledgeable "Leader" agent fails to guide a sensor-limited "Follower" due to a lack of Theory of Mind. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR. Our experiments reveal a significant "Success Gap": while the Leader successfully perceives the target in 35.0% of episodes, the collaborative team succeeds only 17.0% of the time, implying that nearly 50% of feasible plans fail solely due to communicative grounding errors. We demonstrate that a "Pull-based" protocol (active querying) is significantly more robust than standard "Push-based" instruction, with successful episodes featuring 2x the frequency of clarification requests. This research isolates the mechanism of active uncertainty reduction as a prerequisite for safe human-AI and robot-robot collaboration.</description>

      <title>AI Epidemiology: achieving explainable AI through expert oversight patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI Epidemiology is a framework for governing and explaining advanced AI systems by applying population-level surveillance methods to AI outputs. The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.
  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.
  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise.</description>

      <title>Beyond Training: Enabling Self-Evolution of Agents with MOBIMEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex workflows in mobile and desktop environments. However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.
  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.
  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.</description>

      <title>State-Augmented Graphs for Circular Economy Triage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular economy (CE) triage is the assessment of products to determine which sustainable pathway they can follow once they reach the end of their usefulness as they are currently being used. Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.</description>

      <title>PediatricAnxietyBench: Evaluating Large Language Model Safety Under Parental Anxiety and Pressure in Pediatric Consultations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted by parents for pediatric guidance, yet their safety under real-world adversarial pressures is poorly understood. Anxious parents often use urgent language that can compromise model safeguards, potentially causing harmful advice. PediatricAnxietyBench is an open-source benchmark of 300 high-quality queries across 10 pediatric topics (150 patient-derived, 150 adversarial) enabling reproducible evaluation. Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41). The 70B model outperformed the 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95, p&lt;0.001) with lower critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.02). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging strongly correlated with safety (r=0.68, p&lt;0.001), while emergency recognition was absent. Model scale influences safety, yet all models showed vulnerabilities to realistic parental pressures. PediatricAnxietyBench provides a reusable adversarial evaluation framework to reveal clinically significant failure modes overlooked by standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Darth Vecdor: An Open-Source System for Generating Knowledge Graphs Through Large Language Model Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many large language models (LLMs) are trained on a massive body of knowledge present on the Internet. Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database ("knowledge base" or "knowledge graph"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Users need to be cognizant of the potential risks and benefits of using DV and its outputs, and users are responsible for ensuring any use is safe and effective. DV should be assumed to have bugs, potentially very serious ones. However, the author hopes that appropriate use of current and future versions of DV and its outputs can help improve healthcare.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Spreading Activation for Improved Document Retrieval in Knowledge-Graph-Based RAG Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite initial successes and a variety of architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems still struggle to reliably retrieve and connect the multi-step evidence required for complicated reasoning tasks. Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Small Language Models for Efficient Agentic Tool Calling: Outperforming Large Models with Targeted Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As organizations scale adoption of generative AI, model cost optimization and operational efficiency have emerged as critical factors determining sustainability and accessibility. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\%). These findings emphasize that thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower barriers to adoption, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Where do objective functions come from? How do we select what goals to pursue? Human intelligence is adept at synthesizing new objective functions on the fly. How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability? This paper proposes an approach to answering these questions, starting with the concept of a subjective function, a higher-order objective function that is endogenous to the agent (i.e., defined with respect to the agent's features, rather than an external task). Expected prediction error is studied as a concrete example of a subjective function. This proposal has many connections to ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Conversational Time Series Foundation Models: Towards Explainable and Effective Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of time series foundation models has created a landscape where no single method achieves consistent superiority, framing the central challenge not as finding the best model, but as orchestrating an optimal ensemble with interpretability. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.</description>

Abstract: A well-calibrated model should express confidence that matches its actual accuracy -- when it claims 80\% confidence, it should be correct 80\% of the time. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their epistemic calibration remains poorly understood. We introduce \textbf{KalshiBench}, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring after model training cutoffs. Unlike traditional benchmarks measuring accuracy on static knowledge, KalshiBench evaluates whether models can appropriately quantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events. We evaluate five frontier models -- Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B, and Kimi-K2 -- and find \textbf{systematic overconfidence across all models}. Even the best-calibrated model (Claude Opus 4.5, ECE=0.120) shows substantial calibration errors, while reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh exhibit \emph{worse} calibration (ECE=0.395) despite comparable accuracy. Critically, only one model achieves a positive Brier Skill Score, indicating most models perform worse than simply predicting base rates. Our findings suggest that scaling and enhanced reasoning do not automatically confer calibration benefits, highlighting epistemic calibration as a distinct capability requiring targeted development.</description>

      <title>Topic Discovery and Classification for Responsible Generative AI Adaptation in Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) becomes increasingly capable of delivering personalized learning experiences and real-time feedback, a growing number of students are incorporating these tools into their academic workflows. They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics. By providing structured and interpretable policy information, this tool promotes the safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned use of GenAI technologies in education. Furthermore, the system can be integrated into educational technology platforms to help students understand and comply with relevant guidelines.</description>

      <title>WeMusic-Agent: Efficient Conversational Music Recommendation via Knowledge Internalization and Agentic Boundary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized music recommendation in conversational scenarios usually requires a deep understanding of user preferences and nuanced musical context, yet existing methods often struggle with balancing specialized domain knowledge and flexible tool integration. This paper proposes WeMusic-Agent, a training framework for efficient LLM-based conversational music recommendation. By integrating the knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning, the framework aims to teach the model to intelligently decide when to leverage internalized knowledge and when to call specialized tools (e.g., music retrieval APIs, music recommendation systems). Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions, including relevance, personalization, and diversity of the recommendations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models.</description>

      <title>ToolForge: A Data Synthesis Pipeline for Multi-Hop Search without Real-World APIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training LLMs to invoke tools and leverage retrieved information necessitates high-quality, diverse data. However, existing pipelines for synthetic data generation often rely on tens of thousands of real API calls to enhance generalization, incurring prohibitive costs while lacking multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolForge, an automated synthesis framework that achieves strong real-world tool-calling performance by constructing only a small number of virtual tools, eliminating the need for real API calls. ToolForge leverages a (question, golden context, answer) triple to synthesize large-scale tool-learning data specifically designed for multi-hop search scenarios, further enriching the generated data through multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms. To ensure data fidelity, we employ a Multi-Layer Validation Framework that integrates both rule-based and model-based assessments. Empirical results show that a model with only 8B parameters, when trained on our synthesized data, outperforms GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Buycar-arb/ToolForge .</description>

      <title>Weighted K-Harmonic Means Clustering: Convergence Analysis and Applications to Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the \emph{weighted K-harmonic means} (WKHM) clustering algorithm, a regularized variant of K-harmonic means designed to ensure numerical stability while enabling soft assignments through inverse-distance weighting. Unlike classical K-means and constrained K-means, WKHM admits a direct interpretation in wireless networks: its weights are exactly equivalent to fractional user association based on received signal strength. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees under both deterministic and stochastic settings, addressing key technical challenges arising from non-convexity and random initialization. Specifically, we prove monotone descent to a local minimum under fixed initialization, convergence in probability under Binomial Point Process (BPP) initialization, and almost sure convergence under mild decay conditions. These results provide the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering. Finally, through extensive simulations with diverse user distributions, we show that WKHM achieves a superior tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines, making it a principled tool for joint radio node placement and user association in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>PDE-Agent: A toolchain-augmented multi-agent framework for PDE solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone of engineering and scientific research. Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks. This new paradigm of toolchain-augmented multi-agent PDE solving will further advance future developments in automated scientific computing. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Scaling Spatial Reasoning in MLLMs through Programmatic Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied intelligence, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence, is fundamentally constrained by the limited spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of current models. Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>AlignMerge - Alignment-Preserving Large Language Model Merging via Fisher-Guided Geometric Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merging large language models (LLMs) is a practical way to compose capabilities from multiple fine-tuned checkpoints without retraining. Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.
  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:
  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,
  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.
  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models.</description>

      <title>AMUSE: Audio-Visual Benchmark and Alignment Framework for Agentic Multi-Speaker Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen3-Omni show strong perception but struggle in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric settings that demand agentic reasoning tracking who speaks, maintaining roles, and grounding events across time. These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.</description>

      <title>Learning to Wait: Synchronizing Agents with the Physical World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world agentic tasks, unlike synchronous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), often involve non-blocking actions with variable latencies, creating a fundamental \textit{Temporal Gap} between action initiation and completion. Existing environment-side solutions, such as blocking wrappers or frequent polling, either limit scalability or dilute the agent's context window with redundant observations. In this work, we propose an \textbf{Agent-side Approach} that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively align their \textit{Cognitive Timeline} with the physical world. By extending the Code-as-Action paradigm to the temporal domain, agents utilize semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL) to predict precise waiting durations (\texttt{time.sleep(t)}), effectively synchronizing with asynchronous environment without exhaustive checking. Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate that agents can precisely calibrate their internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency, validating that temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.</description>

      <title>QuadSentinel: Sequent Safety for Machine-Checkable Control in Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety risks arise as large language model-based agents solve complex tasks with tools, multi-step plans, and inter-agent messages. However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yyiliu/QuadSentinel.</description>

      <title>OS-Oracle: A Comprehensive Framework for Cross-Platform GUI Critic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With VLM-powered computer-using agents (CUAs) becoming increasingly capable at graphical user interface (GUI) navigation and manipulation, reliable step-level decision-making has emerged as a key bottleneck for real-world deployment. In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples. The resulting critic model, OS-Oracle-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, and surpasses proprietary models on the mobile domain. Furthermore, when serving as a pre-critic, OS-Oracle-7B improves the performance of native GUI agents such as UI-TARS-1.5-7B in OSWorld and AndroidWorld environments. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/numbmelon/OS-Oracle.</description>

      <title>Code-in-the-Loop Forensics: Agentic Tool Use for Image Forgery Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing image forgery detection (IFD) methods either exploit low-level, semantics-agnostic artifacts or rely on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with high-level semantic knowledge. Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD. The code will be released after the review process is completed.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>Design and Evaluation of Cost-Aware PoQ for Decentralized LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models. Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.
  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.</description>

      <title>AI Needs Physics More Than Physics Needs AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is commonly depicted as transformative. Yet, after more than a decade of hype, its measurable impact remains modest outside a few high-profile scientific and commercial successes. The 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics recognized AI's potential, but broader assessments indicate the impact to date is often more promotional than technical. We argue that while current AI may influence physics, physics has significantly more to offer this generation of AI. Current architectures - large language models, reasoning models, and agentic AI - can depend on trillions of meaningless parameters, suffer from distributional bias, lack uncertainty quantification, provide no mechanistic insights, and fail to capture even elementary scientific laws. We review critiques of these limits, highlight opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing, and lay down a roadmap for the adoption of 'Big AI': a synthesis of theory-based rigour with the flexibility of machine learning.</description>

      <title>PCIA: A Path Construction Imitation Algorithm for Global Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm, called Path Construction Imitation Algorithm (PCIA), is proposed. PCIA is inspired by how humans construct new paths and use them. Typically, humans prefer popular transportation routes. In the event of a path closure, a new route is built by mixing the existing paths intelligently. Also, humans select different pathways on a random basis to reach unknown destinations. PCIA generates a random population to find the best route toward the destination, similar to swarm-based algorithms. Each particle represents a path toward the destination. PCIA has been tested with 53 mathematical optimization problems and 13 constrained optimization problems. The results showed that the PCIA is highly competitive compared to both popular and the latest metaheuristic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Synthelite: Chemist-aligned and feasibility-aware synthesis planning with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has long been envisioned as a complementary tool for synthetic chemists. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to allow interaction with human experts, limiting their ability to integrate chemists' insights. In this work, we introduce Synthelite, a synthesis planning framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to directly propose retrosynthetic transformations. Synthelite can generate end-to-end synthesis routes by harnessing the intrinsic chemical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while allowing expert intervention through natural language prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that Synthelite can flexibly adapt its planning trajectory to diverse user-specified constraints, achieving up to 95\% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks. Additionally, Synthelite exhibits the ability to account for chemical feasibility during route design. We envision Synthelite to be both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs are the central orchestrators of synthesis planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly growing popularity of adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), is having a widespread impact throughout society, including the academic domain. AI-supported research has the potential to support researchers with tasks across the entire research life cycle. In this work, we demonstrate the TIB AIssistant, an AI-supported research platform providing support throughout the research life cycle. The AIssistant consists of a collection of assistants, each responsible for a specific research task. In addition, tools are provided to give access to external scholarly services. Generated data is stored in the assets and can be exported as an RO-Crate bundle to provide transparency and enhance reproducibility of the research project. We demonstrate the AIssistant's main functionalities by means of a sequential walk-through of assistants, interacting with each other to generate sections for a draft research paper. In the end, with the AIssistant, we lay the foundation for a larger agenda of providing a community-maintained platform for AI-supported research.</description>

      <title>StarCraft+: Benchmarking Multi-agent Algorithms in Adversary Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are booming in the field of collaborative intelligence, and StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) is widely-used as the benchmark therein. However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA), to refresh the benchmarking of MARL algorithms in an adversary paradigm. Taking StarCraft as infrastructure, the SC2BA environment is specifically created for inter-algorithm adversary with the consideration of fairness, usability and customizability, and meantime an adversarial PyMARL (APyMARL) library is developed with easy-to-use interfaces/modules. Grounding in SC2BA, we benchmark those classic MARL algorithms in two types of adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary, where the former conducts the adversary of pairwise algorithms while the latter focuses on the adversary to multiple behaviors from a group of algorithms. The extensive benchmark experiments exhibit some thought-provoking observations/problems in the effectivity, sensibility and scalability of these completed algorithms. The SC2BA environment as well as reproduced experiments are released in \href{https://github.com/dooliu/SC2BA}{Github}, and we believe that this work could mark a new step for the MARL field in the coming years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Generative AI and Large Language Models promise to transform the way research is conducted, potentially offering unprecedented opportunities to augment scholarly workflows. However, effectively integrating AI into research remains a challenge due to varying domain requirements, limited AI literacy, the complexity of coordinating tools and agents, and the unclear accuracy of Generative AI in research. We present the vision of the TIB AIssistant, a domain-agnostic human-machine collaborative platform designed to support researchers across disciplines in scientific discovery, with AI assistants supporting tasks across the research life cycle. The platform offers modular components - including prompt and tool libraries, a shared data store, and a flexible orchestration framework - that collectively facilitate ideation, literature analysis, methodology development, data analysis, and scholarly writing. We describe the conceptual framework, system architecture, and implementation of an early prototype that demonstrates the feasibility and potential impact of our approach.</description>

      <title>TimeSeries2Report prompting enables adaptive large language model management of lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for interpreting multivariate time-series data, yet their application to real-world battery energy storage system (BESS) operation and maintenance remains largely unexplored. Here, we present TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a prompting framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series into structured, semantically enriched reports, enabling LLMs to reason, predict, and make decisions in BESS management scenarios. TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics. Notably, TS2R-integrated LLMs achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency without retraining or architecture modification, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence.</description>

      <title>cuPilot: A Strategy-Coordinated Multi-agent Framework for CUDA Kernel Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing CUDA kernels is a challenging and labor-intensive task, given the need for hardware-software co-design expertise and the proprietary nature of high-performance kernel libraries. While recent large language models (LLMs) combined with evolutionary algorithms show promise in automatic kernel optimization, existing approaches often fall short in performance due to their suboptimal agent designs and mismatched evolution representations. This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization. Experimental results show that the generated kernels by cuPilot achieve an average speed up of 3.09$\times$ over PyTorch on a benchmark of 100 kernels. On the GEMM tasks, cuPilot showcases sophisticated optimizations and achieves high utilization of critical hardware units. The generated kernels are open-sourced at https://github.com/champloo2878/cuPilot-Kernels.git.</description>

      <title>Quantifying and Bridging the Fidelity Gap: A Decisive-Feature Approach to Comparing Synthetic and Real Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images "look real" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.</description>

      <title>Best Practices For Empirical Meta-Algorithmic Research Guidelines from the COSEAL Research Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical research on meta-algorithmics, such as algorithm selection, configuration, and scheduling, often relies on extensive and thus computationally expensive experiments. With the large degree of freedom we have over our experimental setup and design comes a plethora of possible error sources that threaten the scalability and validity of our scientific insights. Best practices for meta-algorithmic research exist, but they are scattered between different publications and fields, and continue to evolve separately from each other. In this report, we collect good practices for empirical meta-algorithmic research across the subfields of the COSEAL community, encompassing the entire experimental cycle: from formulating research questions and selecting an experimental design, to executing ex- periments, and ultimately, analyzing and presenting results impartially. It establishes the current state-of-the-art practices within meta-algorithmic research and serves as a guideline to both new researchers and practitioners in meta-algorithmic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative art systems often involve high-dimensional and complex parameter spaces in which aesthetically compelling outputs occupy only small, fragmented regions. Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5.js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Energy Efficiency of Local LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.</description>

      <title>From Personalization to Prejudice: Bias and Discrimination in Memory-Enhanced AI Agents for Recruitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents with advanced capabilities for understanding, reasoning, and interacting across diverse tasks. The addition of memory further enhances them by enabling continuity across interactions, learning from past experiences, and improving the relevance of actions and responses over time; termed as memory-enhanced personalization. Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias. While several previous studies have highlighted bias in ML and LLMs, bias due to memory-enhanced personalized agents is largely unexplored. Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation. Our experiments on agents using safety-trained LLMs reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, emphasizing the need for additional protective measures or agent guardrails in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents.</description>

      <title>Needle in the Web: A Benchmark for Retrieving Targeted Web Pages in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into sophisticated agents capable of automating complex real-world tasks, where browsing and reasoning over live web content is key to assessing retrieval and cognitive skills. Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Implementing a Sharia Chatbot as a Consultation Medium for Questions About Islam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents the implementation of a Sharia-compliant chatbot as an interactive medium for consulting Islamic questions, leveraging Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) integrated with Sentence-Transformers for semantic embedding to ensure contextual and accurate responses. Utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology, the system processes a curated Islam QA dataset of 25,000 question-answer pairs from authentic sources like the Qur'an, Hadith, and scholarly fatwas, formatted in JSON for flexibility and scalability. The chatbot prototype, developed with a Flask API backend and Flutter-based mobile frontend, achieves 87% semantic accuracy in functional testing across diverse topics including fiqh, aqidah, ibadah, and muamalah, demonstrating its potential to enhance religious literacy, digital da'wah, and access to verified Islamic knowledge in the Industry 4.0 era. While effective for closed-domain queries, limitations such as static learning and dataset dependency highlight opportunities for future enhancements like continuous adaptation and multi-turn conversation support, positioning this innovation as a bridge between traditional Islamic scholarship and modern AI-driven consultation.</description>

      <title>Prefix Probing: Lightweight Harmful Content Detection for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive AI Literacy: The Case for Centering Human Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid assimilation of Artificial Intelligence technologies into various facets of society has created a significant educational imperative that current frameworks are failing to effectively address. We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Thematic Clustering Of hadith Texts Using The Apriori Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research stems from the urgency to automate the thematic grouping of hadith in line with the growing digitalization of Islamic texts. Based on a literature review, the unsupervised learning approach with the Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data. The dataset used is the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari, which first goes through preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration. These findings demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm has the ability to automatically uncover latent semantic relationships, while contributing to the development of digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems.</description>

      <title>Do Multi-Agents Solve Better Than Single? Evaluating Agentic Frameworks for Diagram-Grounded Geometry Problem Solving and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

      <title>Cyber Humanism in Education: Reclaiming Agency through AI and Learning Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping how knowledge is produced and validated in education. Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures.
  We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \emph{reflexive competence}, \emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education.</description>

      <title>Dual Computational Horizons: Incompleteness and Unpredictability in Intelligent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize two independent computational limitations that constrain algorithmic intelligence: formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability. The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the later bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot compute its own maximal prediction horizon generally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Discovering and Learning Probabilistic Models of Black-Box AI Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box AI (BBAI) systems such as foundational models are increasingly being used for sequential decision making. To ensure that such systems are safe to operate and deploy, it is imperative to develop efficient methods that can provide a sound and interpretable representation of the BBAI's capabilities. This paper shows that PDDL-style representations can be used to efficiently learn and model an input BBAI's planning capabilities. It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities. Theoretical results show soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems illustrate the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of the presented methods.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Prediction of Cancer Pain Episodes: A Hybrid Decision Support Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung cancer patients frequently experience breakthrough pain episodes, with up to 91% requiring timely intervention. To enable proactive pain management, we propose a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline that predicts pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization using both structured and unstructured electronic health record data. A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model. This hybrid approach offers a clinically interpretable and scalable tool for early pain episode forecasting, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation in oncology care.</description>

      <title>CitySeeker: How Do VLMS Explore Embodied Urban Navigation With Implicit Human Needs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in explicit instruction-based navigation; however, their ability to interpret implicit human needs (e.g., "I am thirsty") in dynamic urban environments remains underexplored. This paper introduces CitySeeker, a novel benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making capabilities for exploring embodied urban navigation to address implicit needs. CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling "last-mile" navigation challenges.</description>

      <title>TOGGLE: Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression for Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance across natural language tasks but demand substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware.</description>

      <title>Distributional AGI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI safety and alignment research has predominantly been focused on methods for safeguarding individual AI systems, resting on the assumption of an eventual emergence of a monolithic Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The alternative AGI emergence hypothesis, where general capability levels are first manifested through coordination in groups of sub-AGI individual agents with complementary skills and affordances, has received far less attention. Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks.</description>

      <title>The Social Responsibility Stack: A Control-Theoretic Architecture for Governing Socio-Technical AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in domains that shape human behaviour, institutional decision-making, and societal outcomes. Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Reasoner: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Adversarial Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Pneumonia Localization from Chest X-Rays Using Deep Neural Network and Grad-CAM Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00456v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, but accurately localizing the pneumonia-affected regions typically requires detailed pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time consuming to obtain. To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia-affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer, under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high classification accuracy (96--98\%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V3 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.</description>

      <title>Large Model Enabled Embodied Intelligence for 6G Integrated Perception, Communication, and Computation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization. Together, this work positions LAM-enabled IBSAs as a practical path toward integrated perception, communication, and computation native, safety-critical 6G systems.</description>

      <title>DiscoverDCP: A Data-Driven Approach for Construction of Disciplined Convex Programs via Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Value Lens: Using Large Language Models to Understand Human Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The autonomous decision-making process, which is increasingly applied to computer systems, requires that the choices made by these systems align with human values. In this context, systems must assess how well their decisions reflect human values. To achieve this, it is essential to identify whether each available action promotes or undermines these values. This article presents Value Lens, a text-based model designed to detect human values using generative artificial intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed model operates in two stages: the first aims to formulate a formal theory of values, while the second focuses on identifying these values within a given text. In the first stage, an LLM generates a description based on the established theory of values, which experts then verify. In the second stage, a pair of LLMs is employed: one LLM detects the presence of values, and the second acts as a critic and reviewer of the detection process. The results indicate that Value Lens performs comparably to, and even exceeds, the effectiveness of other models that apply different methods for similar tasks.</description>

Abstract: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets the federal funds rate, shaping monetary policy and the broader economy. We introduce \emph{FedSight AI}, a multi-agent framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to simulate FOMC deliberations and predict policy outcomes. Member agents analyze structured indicators and unstructured inputs such as the Beige Book, debate options, and vote, replicating committee reasoning. A Chain-of-Draft (CoD) extension further improves efficiency and accuracy by enforcing concise multistage reasoning. Evaluated at 2023-2024 meetings, FedSight CoD achieved accuracy of 93.75\% and stability of 93.33\%, outperforming baselines including MiniFed and Ordinal Random Forest (RF), while offering transparent reasoning aligned with real FOMC communications.</description>

      <title>TinyMyo: a Tiny Foundation Model for Flexible EMG Signal Processing at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive sensing modality used in several domains, including biomechanics, rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and emerging human-machine interaction paradigms. Despite decades of use, significant challenges remain in achieving robust generalization across subjects, recording systems, and acquisition protocols. To tackle these challenges, foundation models (FMs) are gaining traction when targeting end-to-end applications based on EMG signals. Yet, existing EMG FMs remain limited to single downstream tasks and lack deployability on embedded platforms. In this work, we present TinyMyo, a lightweight FM based on a Transformer encoder architecture. The model is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on publicly available datasets and achieves high reconstruction fidelity with only 3.6M parameters. With minimal task-specific head adaptations, the same backbone is used to tackle multiple downstream tasks, leveraging datasets acquired from diverse sensing locations and hardware platforms. We demonstrate generalization across hand gesture classification, hand kinematic regression, speech production and recognition, with performance comparable to or surpassing the state of the art (SoA), and model size below 5M parameters. We achieve SoA results compared to previous FM-based works on the NinaPro DB5 ($89.4\pm0.16\%$), UCI-EMG ($97.56\pm0.32\%$), and EPN-612 ($96.74\pm0.09\%$) datasets. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first deployment of an EMG FM on an ultra-low-power microcontroller (GAP9), achieving an average power envelope of 36.45mW. By open-sourcing the pre-trained and the downstream task architectures (https://github.com/pulp-bio/BioFoundation), we aim to provide a flexible resource that can accelerate future research and serve as a common foundation for the EMG community.</description>

      <title>A Context-Free Smart Grid Model Using Complex System Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy and pollution are urging problems of the 21th century. By gradually changing the actual power grid system, smart grid may evolve into different systems by means of size, elements and strategies, but its fundamental requirements and objectives will not change such as optimizing production, transmission, and consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in real world due to time and cost related constraints. Moreover, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system based approach to the smart grid modeling, accentuating on the optimization by combining game theoretical and classical methods in different levels. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved with flexibility and scalability, while keeping its generality.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Ensemble Learning for S\&amp;P 500 Directional Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial market prediction is a challenging application of machine learning, where even small improvements in directional accuracy can yield substantial value. Most models struggle to exceed 55--57\% accuracy due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency. We introduce a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection, achieving 60.14\% directional accuracy on S\&amp;P 500 prediction, a 3.10\% improvement over individual models.
  Our framework addresses three limitations of prior approaches. First, architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity: combining different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the same data outperforms training identical architectures on multiple datasets (60.14\% vs.\ 52.80\%), confirmed by correlation analysis ($r&gt;0.6$ among same-architecture models). Second, a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit enhances sentiment analysis, providing +0.8\% to +1.5\% gains per model. Third, smart filtering excludes weak predictors (accuracy $&lt;52\%$), improving ensemble performance (Top-7 models: 60.14\% vs.\ all 35 models: 51.2\%).
  We evaluate on 2020--2023 market data across seven instruments, covering diverse regimes including the COVID-19 crash and inflation-driven correction. McNemar's test confirms statistical significance ($p&lt;0.05$). Preliminary backtesting with confidence-based filtering (6+ model consensus) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8, demonstrating practical trading potential.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Modeling for Uncertainty Management in Financial Risk Forecasting and Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bayesian analytics framework that precisely quantifies uncertainty offers a significant advance for financial risk management. We develop an integrated approach that consistently enhances the handling of risk in market volatility forecasting, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring. Our probabilistic, interpretable models deliver reliable results: We evaluate the performance of one-day-ahead 95% Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts on daily S&amp;P 500 returns, with a training period from 2000 to 2019 and an out-of-sample test period spanning 2020 to 2024. Formal tests of unconditional (Kupiec) and conditional (Christoffersen) coverage reveal that an LSTM baseline achieves near-nominal calibration. In contrast, a GARCH(1,1) model with Student-t innovations underestimates tail risk. Our proposed discount-factor DLM model produces a slightly liberal VaR estimate, with evidence of clustered violations. Bayesian logistic regression improves recall and AUC-ROC for fraud detection, and a hierarchical Beta state-space model provides transparent and adaptive compliance risk assessment. The pipeline is distinguished by precise uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and GPU-accelerated analysis, delivering up to 50x speedup. Remaining challenges include sparse fraud data and proxy compliance labels, but the framework enables actionable risk insights. Future expansion will extend feature sets, explore regime-switching priors, and enhance scalable inference.</description>

      <title>LLaDA2.0: Scaling Up Diffusion Language Models to 100B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.</description>

      <title>GLOW: Graph-Language Co-Reasoning for Agentic Workflow Performance Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic Workflows (AWs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, the scalability of automating their generation is severely constrained by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation. Existing AW performance prediction methods act as surrogates but fail to simultaneously capture the intricate topological dependencies and the deep semantic logic embedded in AWs. To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.</description>

      <title>TAO-Net: Two-stage Adaptive OOD Classification Network for Fine-grained Encrypted Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification aims to identify applications or services by analyzing network traffic data. One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single "Other" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.</description>

      <title>ReactorFold: Generative discovery of nuclear reactor cores via emergent physical reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing nuclear reactor cores requires navigating large discrete design spaces governed by complex neutronic interactions. Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.</description>

      <title>Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation for Personalized Intraoperative Hypotension Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) poses significant surgical risks, but accurate prediction remains challenging due to patient-specific variability. While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.</description>

      <title>AdaGradSelect: An adaptive gradient-guided layer selection method for efficient fine-tuning of SLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform many NLP tasks well, but fully fine-tuning them is expensive and requires a lot of memory. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.
  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.
  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.
  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B. It also achieves similar accuracy on the MATH dataset. Overall, AdaGradSelect provides a more effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.</description>

      <title>LOOPRAG: Enhancing Loop Transformation Optimization with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop transformations are semantics-preserving optimization techniques, widely used to maximize objectives such as parallelism. Despite decades of research, applying the optimal composition of loop transformations remains challenging due to inherent complexities, including cost modeling for optimization objectives. Recent studies have explored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization. However, our key observation is that LLMs often struggle with effective loop transformation optimization, frequently leading to errors or suboptimal optimization, thereby missing opportunities for performance improvements. To bridge this gap, we propose LOOPRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to guide LLMs in performing effective loop optimization on Static Control Part. We introduce a parameter-driven method to harness loop properties, which trigger various loop transformations, and generate diverse yet legal example codes serving as a demonstration source. To effectively obtain the most informative demonstrations, we propose a loop-aware algorithm based on loop features, which balances similarity and diversity for code retrieval. To enhance correct and efficient code generation, we introduce a feedback-based iterative mechanism that incorporates compilation, testing and performance results as feedback to guide LLMs. Each optimized code undergoes mutation, coverage and differential testing for equivalence checking. We evaluate LOOPRAG on PolyBench, TSVC and LORE benchmark suites, and compare it against compilers (GCC-Graphite, Clang-Polly, Perspective and ICX) and representative LLMs (DeepSeek and GPT-4). The results demonstrate average speedups over base compilers of up to 11.20$\times$, 14.34$\times$, and 9.29$\times$ for PolyBench, TSVC, and LORE, respectively, and speedups over base LLMs of up to 11.97$\times$, 5.61$\times$, and 11.59$\times$.</description>

      <title>Bridging Data and Physics: A Graph Neural Network-Based Hybrid Twin Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating complex unsteady physical phenomena relies on detailed mathematical models, simulated for instance by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of cyberattack data hinders the development of robust intrusion detection systems. This paper introduces PHANTOM, a novel adversarial variational framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic attack data. Its innovations include progressive training, a dual-path VAE-GAN architecture, and domain-specific feature matching to preserve the semantics of attacks. Evaluated on 100,000 network traffic samples, models trained on PHANTOM data achieve 98% weighted accuracy on real attacks. Statistical analyses confirm that the synthetic data preserves authentic distributions and diversity. Limitations in generating rare attack types are noted, highlighting challenges with severe class imbalance. This work advances the generation of synthetic data for training robust, privacy-preserving detection systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Chain Backdoor: Do You Trust Diffusion Models as Generative Data Supplier?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of generative models such as diffusion models for synthetic data augmentation has greatly reduced the cost of data collection and labeling in downstream perception tasks. However, this new data source paradigm may introduce important security concerns. This work investigates backdoor propagation in such emerging generative data supply chains, namely Data-Chain Backdoor (DCB). Specifically, we find that open-source diffusion models can become hidden carriers of backdoors. Their strong distribution-fitting ability causes them to memorize and reproduce backdoor triggers during generation, which are subsequently inherited by downstream models, resulting in severe security risks. This threat is particularly concerning under clean-label attack scenarios, as it remains effective while having negligible impact on the utility of the synthetic data. Furthermore, we discover an Early-Stage Trigger Manifestation (ESTM) phenomenon: backdoor trigger patterns tend to surface more explicitly in the early, high-noise stages of the diffusion model's reverse generation process before being subtly integrated into the final samples. Overall, this work reveals a previously underexplored threat in generative data pipelines and provides initial insights toward mitigating backdoor risks in synthetic data generation.</description>

      <title>TENG++: Time-Evolving Natural Gradient for Solving PDEs With Deep Neural Nets under General Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.</description>

      <title>TS-DP: Reinforcement Speculative Decoding For Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Policy Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) excels in embodied control but suffers from high inference latency and computational cost due to multiple iterative denoising steps. The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Web User Interface Design Via Cross-Device Responsiveness Assessment Using An Improved HCI-INTEGRATED DL Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User Interface (UI) optimization is essential in the digital era to enhance user satisfaction in web environments. Nevertheless, the existing UI optimization models had overlooked the Cross-Responsiveness (CR) assessment, affecting the user interaction efficiency. Consequently, this article proposes a dynamic web UI optimization through CR assessment using Finite Exponential Continuous State Machine (FECSM) and Quokka Nonlinear Difference Swarm Optimization Algorithm (QNDSOA). Initially, the design and user interaction related information is collected as well as pre-processed for min-max normalization. Next, the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)-based features are extracted, followed by user behaviour pattern grouping. Meanwhile, the CR assessment is done using FECSM. Then, the proposed Bidirectional Gated Luong and Mish Recurrent Unit (BiGLMRU) is used to classify the User eXperience (UX) change type, which is labelled based on the User Interface Change Prediction Index (UICPI). Lastly, a novel QNDSOA is utilized to optimize the UI design with an average fitness of 98.5632%. Feedback monitoring is done after optimal deployment.</description>

      <title>Cultural Rights and the Rights to Development in the Age of AI: Implications for Global Human Rights Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cultural rights and the right to development are essential norms within the wider framework of international human rights law. However, recent technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and adjacent digital frontier technologies pose significant challenges to the protection and realization of these rights. This owes to the increasing influence of AI systems on the creation and depiction of cultural content, affect the use and distribution of the intellectual property of individuals and communities, and influence cultural participation and expression worldwide. In addition, the growing influence of AI thus risks exacerbating preexisting economic, social and digital divides and reinforcing inequities for marginalized communities. This dynamic challenges the existing interplay between cultural rights and the right to development, and raises questions about the integration of cultural and developmental considerations into emerging AI governance frameworks. To address these challenges, the paper examines the impact of AI on both categories of rights. Conceptually, it analyzes the epistemic and normative limitations of AI with respect to cultural and developmental assumptions embedded in algorithmic design and deployment, but also individual and structural impacts of AI on both rights. On this basis, the paper identifies gaps and tensions in existing AI governance frameworks with respect to cultural rights and the right to development.
  By situating cultural rights and the right to development within the broader landscape of AI and human rights, this paper contributes to the academic discourse on AI ethics, legal frameworks, and international human rights law. Finally, it outlines avenues for future research and policy development based on existing conversations in global AI governance.</description>

      <title>Toward Agentic Environments: GenAI and the Convergence of AI, Sustainability, and Human-Centric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), have made human-computer interactions more frequent, efficient, and accessible across sectors ranging from banking to healthcare. AI tools embedded in digital devices support decision-making and operational management at both individual and organizational levels, including resource allocation, workflow automation, and real-time data analysis. However, the prevailing cloud-centric deployment of AI carries a substantial environmental footprint due to high computational demands. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of agentic environments, a sustainability-oriented AI framework that extends beyond reactive systems by leveraging GenAI, multi-agent systems, and edge computing to reduce the environmental impact of technology. Agentic environments enable more efficient resource use, improved quality of life, and sustainability-by-design, while simultaneously enhancing data privacy through decentralized, edge-driven solutions. Drawing on secondary research as well as primary data from focus groups and semi-structured interviews with AI professionals from leading technology companies, the paper proposes a conceptual framework for agentic environments examined through three lenses: the personal sphere, professional and commercial use, and urban operations. The findings highlight the potential of agentic environments to foster sustainable ecosystems through optimized resource utilization and strengthened data privacy. The study concludes with recommendations for edge-driven deployment models to reduce reliance on energy-intensive cloud infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of AI Ethics Tools in Language Models: A Developers' Perspective Case Stud</title>

Abstract: In Artificial Intelligence (AI), language models have gained significant importance due to the widespread adoption of systems capable of simulating realistic conversations with humans through text generation. Because of their impact on society, developing and deploying these language models must be done responsibly, with attention to their negative impacts and possible harms. In this scenario, the number of AI Ethics Tools (AIETs) publications has recently increased. These AIETs are designed to help developers, companies, governments, and other stakeholders establish trust, transparency, and responsibility with their technologies by bringing accepted values to guide AI's design, development, and use stages. However, many AIETs lack good documentation, examples of use, and proof of their effectiveness in practice. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating AIETs in language models. Our approach involved an extensive literature survey on 213 AIETs, and after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we selected four AIETs: Model Cards, ALTAI, FactSheets, and Harms Modeling. For evaluation, we applied AIETs to language models developed for the Portuguese language, conducting 35 hours of interviews with their developers. The evaluation considered the developers' perspective on the AIETs' use and quality in helping to identify ethical considerations about their model. The results suggest that the applied AIETs serve as a guide for formulating general ethical considerations about language models. However, we note that they do not address unique aspects of these models, such as idiomatic expressions. Additionally, these AIETs did not help to identify potential negative impacts of models for the Portuguese language.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become indispensable tools for acquiring information and supporting human decision-making. However, ensuring that these models uphold fairness across varied contexts is critical to their safe and responsible deployment. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive examination of four widely adopted LLMs, probing their underlying biases and inclinations across the dimensions of politics, ideology, alliance, language, and gender. Through a series of carefully designed experiments, we investigate their political neutrality using news summarization, ideological biases through news stance classification, tendencies toward specific geopolitical alliances via United Nations voting patterns, language bias in the context of multilingual story completion, and gender-related affinities as revealed by responses to the World Values Survey. Results indicate that while the LLMs are aligned to be neutral and impartial, they still show biases and affinities of different types.</description>

      <title>Explainable Ethical Assessment on Human Behaviors by Generating Conflicting Social Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human behaviors are often guided or constrained by social norms, which are defined as shared, commonsense rules. For example, underlying an action ``\textit{report a witnessed crime}" are social norms that inform our conduct, such as ``\textit{It is expected to be brave to report crimes}''. Current AI systems that assess valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human actions by leveraging large-scale data training not grounded on explicit norms may be difficult to explain, and thus untrustworthy. Emulating human assessors by considering social norms can help AI models better understand and predict valence. While multiple norms come into play, conflicting norms can create tension and directly influence human behavior. For example, when deciding whether to ``\textit{report a witnessed crime}'', one may balance \textit{bravery} against \textit{self-protection}. In this paper, we introduce \textit{ClarityEthic}, a novel ethical assessment approach, to enhance valence prediction and explanation by generating conflicting social norms behind human actions, which strengthens the moral reasoning capabilities of language models by using a contrastive learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baseline approaches, and human evaluations confirm that the generated social norms provide plausible explanations for the assessment of human behaviors.</description>

      <title>Cybercrime and Computer Forensics in Epoch of Artificial Intelligence in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of generative Artificial Intelligence into the digital ecosystem necessitates a critical re-evaluation of Indian criminal jurisprudence regarding computational forensics integrity. While algorithmic efficiency enhances evidence extraction, a research gap exists regarding the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023's compatibility with adversarial AI threats, specifically anti-forensics and deepfakes. This study scrutinizes the AI "dual-use" dilemma, functioning as both a cyber-threat vector and forensic automation mechanism, to delineate privacy boundaries in high-stakes investigations. Employing a doctrinal legal methodology, the research synthesizes statutory analysis of the DPDP Act with global ethical frameworks (IEEE, EU) to evaluate regulatory efficacy. Preliminary results indicate that while Machine Learning offers high accuracy in pattern recognition, it introduces vulnerabilities regarding data poisoning and algorithmic bias. Findings highlight a critical tension between the Act's data minimization principles and forensic data retention requirements. Furthermore, the paper identifies that existing legal definitions inadequately encompass AI-driven "tool crimes" and "target crimes." Consequently, the research proposes a "human-centric" forensic model prioritizing explainable AI (XAI) to ensure evidence admissibility. These implications suggest that synchronizing Indian privacy statutes with international forensic standards is imperative to mitigate synthetic media risks, establishing a roadmap for future legislative amendments and technical standardization.</description>

      <title>Edge-wise Topological Divergence Gaps: Guiding Search in Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a topological feedback mechanism for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) by analyzing the divergence between a tour and the minimum spanning tree (MST). Our key contribution is a canonical decomposition theorem that expresses the tour-MST gap as edge-wise topology-divergence gaps from the RTD-Lite barcode. Based on this, we develop a topological guidance for 2-opt and 3-opt heuristics that increases their performance. We carry out experiments with fine-optimization of tours obtained from heatmap-based methods, TSPLIB, and random instances. Experiments demonstrate the topology-guided optimization results in better performance and faster convergence in many cases.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models in Biomedical Imaging: Turning Hype into Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are driving a prominent shift in artificial intelligence across different domains, including biomedical imaging. These models are designed to move beyond narrow pattern recognition towards emulating sophisticated clinical reasoning, understanding complex spatial relationships, and integrating multimodal data with unprecedented flexibility. However, a critical gap exists between this potential and the current reality, where the clinical evaluation and deployment of FMs are hampered by significant challenges. Herein, we critically assess the current state-of-the-art, analyzing hype by examining the core capabilities and limitations of FMs in the biomedical domain. We also provide a taxonomy of reasoning, ranging from emulated sequential logic and spatial understanding to the integration of explicit symbolic knowledge, to evaluate whether these models exhibit genuine cognition or merely mimic surface-level patterns. We argue that a critical frontier lies beyond statistical correlation, in the pursuit of causal inference, which is essential for building robust models that understand cause and effect. Furthermore, we discuss the paramount issues in deployment stemming from trustworthiness, bias, and safety, dissecting the challenges of algorithmic bias, data bias and privacy, and model hallucinations. We also draw attention to the need for more inclusive, rigorous, and clinically relevant validation frameworks to ensure their safe and ethical application. We conclude that while the vision of autonomous AI-doctors remains distant, the immediate reality is the emergence of powerful technology and assistive tools that would benefit clinical practice. The future of FMs in biomedical imaging hinges not on scale alone, but on developing hybrid, causally aware, and verifiably safe systems that augment, rather than replace, human expertise.</description>

      <title>CodeMem: Architecting Reproducible Agents via Dynamic MCP and Procedural Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current tool-using AI agents suffer from limited action space, context inefficiency, and probabilistic instability that makes them unsuitable for handling repetitive tasks which are otherwise reliably and efficiently tackled by agentic workflows built on platforms like n8n and Zapier. Earlier works like CodeAct, DynaSaur, Code Mode have tried to tackle the first two issues by using the whole Python language as its action space: The number of tools that the agent can call becomes infinite. Python code blocks can execute complex actions into a single step and print only relevant results which helps in keeping the context lean. However, the probabilistic instability issue still remains, as for the same task in the same environment, the agent can follow different trajectories due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. Therefore, we need procedural memory for consistency and reliability. This paper proposes CodeMem, an architecture to implement procedural memory via code which can be used to build and run reusable agentic workflows with deterministic reliability.</description>

      <title>A Neurosymbolic Approach to Loop Invariant Generation via Weakest Precondition Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop invariant generation remains a critical bottleneck in automated program verification. Recent work has begun to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area, yet these approaches tend to lack a reliable and structured methodology, with little reference to existing program verification theory. This paper presents NeuroInv, a neurosymbolic approach to loop invariant generation. NeuroInv comprises two key modules: (1) a neural reasoning module that leverages LLMs and Hoare logic to derive and refine candidate invariants via backward-chaining weakest precondition reasoning, and (2) a verification-guided symbolic module that iteratively repairs invariants using counterexamples from OpenJML. We evaluate NeuroInv on a comprehensive benchmark of 150 Java programs, encompassing single and multiple (sequential) loops, multiple arrays, random branching, and noisy code segments. NeuroInv achieves a $99.5\%$ success rate, substantially outperforming the other evaluated approaches. Additionally, we introduce a hard benchmark of $10$ larger multi-loop programs (with an average of $7$ loops each); NeuroInv's performance in this setting demonstrates that it can scale to more complex verification scenarios.</description>

      <title>Human-like Working Memory from Artificial Intrinsic Plasticity Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working memory enables the brain to integrate transient information for rapid decision-making. Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a &gt;20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Agentic Language Model Inference via Speculative Tool Calls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are becoming increasingly dependent on external tools. LM-based agentic frameworks frequently interact with their environment via such tools to search files, run code, call APIs, etc. Further, modern reasoning-based LMs use tools such as web search and Python code execution to enhance their reasoning capabilities. While tools greatly improve the capabilities of LMs, they also introduce performance bottlenecks during the inference process. In this paper, we introduce novel systems optimizations to address such performance bottlenecks by speculating tool calls and forcing sequences to remain resident in the inference engine to minimize overheads. Our optimizations lead to throughput improvements of several hundred tokens per second when hosting inference for LM agents. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms to provide insights into speculation configurations that will yield the best performance. Further, we recommend a new "tool cache" API endpoint to enable LM providers to easily adopt these optimizations.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beyond Words: Self-Supervised Visual Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in connecting vision and language, yet their proficiency in fundamental visual reasoning tasks remains limited. This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities. Our source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/JARVIS.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mechanisms for Coordinating Long-term Working Memory Based on the Precision of Spike-timing in Cortical Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of the millisecond precision of spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could, in principle, preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. It could support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are synchronously stimulated. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025).</description>

      <title>VET Your Agent: Towards Host-Independent Autonomy via Verifiable Execution Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new generation of autonomous agents that operate over sustained periods and manage sensitive resources on behalf of users. Trusted for their ability to act without direct oversight, such agents are increasingly considered in high-stakes domains including financial management, dispute resolution, and governance. Yet in practice, agents execute on infrastructure controlled by a host, who can tamper with models, inputs, or outputs, undermining any meaningful notion of autonomy.
  We address this gap by introducing VET (Verifiable Execution Traces), a formal framework that achieves host-independent authentication of agent outputs and takes a step toward host-independent autonomy. Central to VET is the Agent Identity Document (AID), which specifies an agent's configuration together with the proof systems required for verification. VET is compositional: it supports multiple proof mechanisms, including trusted hardware, succinct cryptographic proofs, and notarized TLS transcripts (Web Proofs).
  We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads. We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient. As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy. Our results demonstrate that practical, host-agnostic authentication is already possible with current technology, laying the foundation for future systems that achieve full host-independent autonomy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reading stories evokes rich interpretive, affective, and evaluative responses, such as inferences about narrative intent or judgments about characters. Yet, computational models of reader response are limited, preventing nuanced analyses. To address this gap, we introduce SocialStoryFrames, a formalism for distilling plausible inferences about reader response, such as perceived author intent, explanatory and predictive reasoning, affective responses, and value judgments, using conversational context and a taxonomy grounded in narrative theory, linguistic pragmatics, and psychology. We develop two models, SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier, validated through human surveys (N=382 participants) and expert annotations, respectively. We conduct pilot analyses to showcase the utility of the formalism for studying storytelling at scale. Specifically, applying our models to SSF-Corpus, a curated dataset of 6,140 social media stories from diverse contexts, we characterize the frequency and interdependence of storytelling intents, and we compare and contrast narrative practices (and their diversity) across communities. By linking fine-grained, context-sensitive modeling with a generic taxonomy of reader responses, SocialStoryFrames enable new research into storytelling in online communities.</description>

      <title>Scalable Agentic Reasoning for Designing Biologics Targeting Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) represent crucial therapeutic targets due to their significant role in disease -- approximately 80\% of cancer-related proteins contain long disordered regions -- but their lack of stable secondary/tertiary structures makes them "undruggable". While recent computational advances, such as diffusion models, can design high-affinity IDP binders, translating these to practical drug discovery requires autonomous systems capable of reasoning across complex conformational ensembles and orchestrating diverse computational tools at scale.To address this challenge, we designed and implemented StructBioReasoner, a scalable multi-agent system for designing biologics that can be used to target IDPs. StructBioReasoner employs a novel tournament-based reasoning framework where specialized agents compete to generate and refine therapeutic hypotheses, naturally distributing computational load for efficient exploration of the vast design space. Agents integrate domain knowledge with access to literature synthesis, AI-structure prediction, molecular simulations, and stability analysis, coordinating their execution on HPC infrastructure via an extensible federated agentic middleware, Academy. We benchmark StructBioReasoner across Der f 21 and NMNAT-2 and demonstrate that over 50\% of 787 designed and validated candidates for Der f 21 outperformed the human-designed reference binders from literature, in terms of improved binding free energy. For the more challenging NMNAT-2 protein, we identified three binding modes from 97,066 binders, including the well-studied NMNAT2:p53 interface. Thus, StructBioReasoner lays the groundwork for agentic reasoning systems for IDP therapeutic discovery on Exascale platforms.</description>

      <title>SALVE: Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing for Mechanistic Control of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve impressive performance but remain difficult to interpret and control. We present SALVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing), a unified "discover, validate, and control" framework that bridges mechanistic interpretability and model editing. Using an $\ell_1$-regularized autoencoder, we learn a sparse, model-native feature basis without supervision. We validate these features with Grad-FAM, a feature-level saliency mapping method that visually grounds latent features in input data. Leveraging the autoencoder's structure, we perform precise and permanent weight-space interventions, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features. We further derive a critical suppression threshold, $\alpha_{crit}$, quantifying each class's reliance on its dominant feature, supporting fine-grained robustness diagnostics. Our approach is validated on both convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, demonstrating consistent, interpretable control over their behavior. This work contributes a principled methodology for turning feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing the development of transparent and controllable AI systems.</description>

      <title>Seeing is Believing (and Predicting): Context-Aware Multi-Human Behavior Prediction with Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting human behaviors is crucial for mobile robots operating in human-populated environments. While prior research primarily focuses on predicting actions in single-human scenarios from an egocentric view, several robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective. To this end, we present CAMP-VLM (Context-Aware Multi-human behavior Prediction): a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework that incorporates contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs to enhance prediction of humans-scene interactions. Due to the lack of suitable datasets for multi-human behavior prediction from an observer view, we perform fine-tuning of CAMP-VLM with synthetic human behavior data generated by a photorealistic simulator, and evaluate the resulting models on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess their generalization capabilities. Leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CAMP-VLM outperforms the best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit nonlinear relationships between performance, cost, and token usage. This paper presents a quantitative study on structured prompting using BRAID (Bounded Reasoning for Au tonomous Inference and Decisions) across multiple GPT model tiers, eval uated on the AdvancedIF, GSM-Hard, and the SCALE MultiChallenge benchmark datasets. BRAID introduces a bounded reasoning framework using Mermaid-based instruction graphs that enable models to reason struc turally rather than through unbounded natural-language token expansion. We show that structured machine-readable prompts substantially increase reasoning accuracy and cost efficiency for agents in production systems. The findings establish BRAID as an effective and scalable technique for optimizing inference efficiency in autonomous agent systems. All datasets and detailed result logs are available at https://benchmark.openserv.ai.</description>

      <title>OLAF: Towards Robust LLM-Based Annotation Framework in Empirical Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in empirical software engineering (ESE) to automate or assist annotation tasks such as labeling commits, issues, and qualitative artifacts. Yet the reliability and reproducibility of such annotations remain underexplored. Existing studies often lack standardized measures for reliability, calibration, and drift, and frequently omit essential configuration details. We argue that LLM-based annotation should be treated as a measurement process rather than a purely automated activity. In this position paper, we outline the \textbf{Operationalization for LLM-based Annotation Framework (OLAF)}, a conceptual framework that organizes key constructs: \textit{reliability, calibration, drift, consensus, aggregation}, and \textit{transparency}. The paper aims to motivate methodological discussion and future empirical work toward more transparent and reproducible LLM-based annotation in software engineering research.</description>

      <title>Embedding Software Intent: Lightweight Java Module Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an increasing number of software systems reach unprecedented scale, relying solely on code-level abstractions is becoming impractical. While architectural abstractions offer a means to manage these systems, maintaining their consistency with the actual code has been problematic. The Java Platform Module System (JPMS), introduced in Java 9, addresses this limitation by enabling explicit module specification at the language level. JPMS enhances architectural implementation through improved encapsulation and direct specification of ground-truth architectures within Java projects. Although many projects are written in Java, modularizing existing monolithic projects to JPMS modules is an open challenge due to ineffective module recovery by existing architecture recovery techniques. To address this challenge, this paper presents ClassLAR (Class-and Language model-based Architectural Recovery), a novel, lightweight, and efficient approach that recovers Java modules from monolithic Java systems using fully-qualified class names. ClassLAR leverages language models to extract semantic information from package and class names, capturing both structural and functional intent. In evaluations across 20 popular Java projects, ClassLAR outperformed all state-of-the-art techniques in architectural-level similarity metrics while achieving execution times that were 3.99 to 10.50 times faster.</description>

      <title>Provably Extracting the Features from a General Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely believed that complex machine learning models generally encode features through linear representations, but these features exist in superposition, making them challenging to recover. We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \[ f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\,\sigma_i(v_i^\top x), \] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $\sigma_i:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.
  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n &gt; d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \neq j$, and general response functions $\sigma_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Neural Architecture Codesign Package (SNAC-Pack)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search is a powerful approach for automating model design, but existing methods struggle to accurately optimize for real hardware performance, often relying on proxy metrics such as bit operations. We present Surrogate Neural Architecture Codesign Package (SNAC-Pack), an integrated framework that automates the discovery and optimization of neural networks focusing on FPGA deployment. SNAC-Pack combines Neural Architecture Codesign's multi-stage search capabilities with the Resource Utilization and Latency Estimator, enabling multi-objective optimization across accuracy, FPGA resource utilization, and latency without requiring time-intensive synthesis for each candidate model. We demonstrate SNAC-Pack on a high energy physics jet classification task, achieving 63.84% accuracy with resource estimation. When synthesized on a Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU13P FPGA, the SNAC-Pack model matches baseline accuracy while maintaining comparable resource utilization to models optimized using traditional BOPs metrics. This work demonstrates the potential of hardware-aware neural architecture search for resource-constrained deployments and provides an open-source framework for automating the design of efficient FPGA-accelerated models.</description>

      <title>Towards Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration for Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning: A Summary of Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the agroecosystem carbon cycle at decision-relevant scales is essential for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states. This work extends the prior SDSA-KGML framework.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Inference of Human Perceptions of Robot Performance in Social Navigation Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how humans evaluate robot behavior during human-robot interactions is crucial for developing socially aware robots that behave according to human expectations. While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy. This work paves the path to improving robot behavior in a scalable manner through user-centered feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative multilingual bias evaluation framework for assessing bias in Large Language Models, combining explicit bias assessment through the BBQ benchmark with implicit bias measurement using a prompt-based Implicit Association Test. By translating the prompts and word list into five target languages, English, Chinese, Arabic, French, and Spanish, we directly compare different types of bias across languages. The results reveal substantial gaps in bias across languages used in LLMs. For example, Arabic and Spanish consistently show higher levels of stereotype bias, while Chinese and English exhibit lower levels of bias. We also identify contrasting patterns across bias types. Age shows the lowest explicit bias but the highest implicit bias, emphasizing the importance of detecting implicit biases that are undetectable with standard benchmarks. These findings indicate that LLMs vary significantly across languages and bias dimensions. This study fills a key research gap by providing a comprehensive methodology for cross-lingual bias analysis. Ultimately, our work establishes a foundation for the development of equitable multilingual LLMs, ensuring fairness and effectiveness across diverse languages and cultures.</description>

      <title>Are We on the Right Way to Assessing LLM-as-a-Judge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely adopted as an evaluation method and served as supervised rewards in model training. However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation. Inspired by axioms of rational choice theory, Sage introduces two new lenses for measuring LLM-as-a-Judge: local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity across a full set of preferences). We curate a dataset of 650 questions by combining structured benchmark problems with real-world user queries. Our experiments demonstrate both the stability of our metrics and their high correlation with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2, confirming Sage's reliability as an evaluation suite for the robustness and accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge. Based on Sage, we reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant reliability problems when acting as judges in both scoring and pairwise settings; even the top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly a quarter of difficult cases. We attribute this to a new phenomenon called situational preference, which explains why explicit rubrics or criteria can help the model judge consistently across answer pairs. Our further analysis shows that finetuned LLM-as-a-Judge is a feasible method to boost performance, and the panel-based judge as well as deep reasoning can enhance the judging consistency. We also find substantial inconsistency in human judgments, which indicates that human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard.</description>

      <title>CauSTream: Causal Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning for Streamflow Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Large Language Model Framework for Automated Qualitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16063</link>

Abstract: Understanding patients experiences is essential for advancing patient centered care, especially in chronic diseases that require ongoing communication. However, qualitative thematic analysis, the primary approach for exploring these experiences, remains labor intensive, subjective, and difficult to scale. In this study, we developed a multi agent large language model framework that automates qualitative thematic analysis through three agents (Instructor, Thematizer, CodebookGenerator), named Collaborative Theme Identification Agent (CoTI). We applied CoTI to 12 heart failure patient interviews to analyze their perceptions of medication intensity. CoTI identified key phrases, themes, and codebook that were more similar to those of the senior investigator than both junior investigators and baseline NLP models. We also implemented CoTI into a user-facing application to enable AI human interaction in qualitative analysis. However, collaboration between CoTI and junior investigators provided only marginal gains, suggesting they may overrely on CoTI and limit their independent critical thinking.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Radio Frequency Based Wireless Sensing of Lead Contamination in Soil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widespread Pb (lead) contamination of urban soil significantly impacts food safety and public health and hinders city greening efforts. However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with &gt; 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified. The results of this study show that it is feasible to build portable and affordable Pb detection and screening devices based on wireless technology.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Generative Models for Emotional 3D Animation Generation in VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social interactions incorporate nonverbal signals to convey emotions alongside speech, including facial expressions and body gestures. Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development. Finally, participants positively recognized animation diversity across all generative models.</description>

      <title>Scaling Text2SQL via LLM-efficient Schema Filtering with Functional Dependency Graph Rerankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most modern Text2SQL systems prompt large language models (LLMs) with entire schemas -- mostly column information -- alongside the user's question. While effective on small databases, this approach fails on real-world schemas that exceed LLM context limits, even for commercial models. The recent Spider 2.0 benchmark exemplifies this with hundreds of tables and tens of thousands of columns, where existing systems often break. Current mitigations either rely on costly multi-step prompting pipelines or filter columns by ranking them against user's question independently, ignoring inter-column structure. To scale existing systems, we introduce \toolname, an open-source, LLM-efficient schema filtering framework that compacts Text2SQL prompts by (i) ranking columns with a query-aware LLM encoder enriched with values and metadata, (ii) reranking inter-connected columns via a lightweight graph transformer over functional dependencies, and (iii) selecting a connectivity-preserving sub-schema with a Steiner-tree heuristic. Experiments on real datasets show that \toolname achieves near-perfect recall and higher precision than CodeS, SchemaExP, Qwen rerankers, and embedding retrievers, while maintaining sub-second median latency and scaling to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

      <title>LAPX: Lightweight Hourglass Network with Global Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human pose estimation is a crucial task in computer vision. Methods that have SOTA (State-of-the-Art) accuracy, often involve a large number of parameters and incur substantial computational cost. Many lightweight variants have been proposed to reduce the model size and computational cost of them. However, several of these methods still contain components that are not well suited for efficient deployment on edge devices. Moreover, models that primarily emphasize inference speed on edge devices often suffer from limited accuracy due to their overly simplified designs. To address these limitations, we propose LAPX, an Hourglass network with self-attention that captures global contextual information, based on previous work, LAP. In addition to adopting the self-attention module, LAPX advances the stage design and refine the lightweight attention modules. It achieves competitive results on two benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO, with only 2.3M parameters, and demonstrates real-time performance, confirming its edge-device suitability.</description>

      <title>TurboDiffusion: Accelerating Video Diffusion Models by 100-200 Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TurboDiffusion, a video generation acceleration framework that can speed up end-to-end diffusion generation by 100-200x while maintaining video quality. TurboDiffusion mainly relies on several components for acceleration: (1) Attention acceleration: TurboDiffusion uses low-bit SageAttention and trainable Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) to speed up attention computation. (2) Step distillation: TurboDiffusion adopts rCM for efficient step distillation. (3) W8A8 quantization: TurboDiffusion quantizes model parameters and activations to 8 bits to accelerate linear layers and compress the model. In addition, TurboDiffusion incorporates several other engineering optimizations.
  We conduct experiments on the Wan2.2-I2V-14B-720P, Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-480P, Wan2.1-T2V-14B-720P, and Wan2.1-T2V-14B-480P models. Experimental results show that TurboDiffusion achieves 100-200x speedup for video generation even on a single RTX 5090 GPU, while maintaining comparable video quality. The GitHub repository, which includes model checkpoints and easy-to-use code, is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/TurboDiffusion.</description>

      <title>AIMM: An AI-Driven Multimodal Framework for Detecting Social-Media-Influenced Stock Market Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Market manipulation now routinely originates from coordinated social media campaigns, not isolated trades. Retail investors, regulators, and brokerages need tools that connect online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior. We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.
  The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak.
  The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance.</description>

      <title>ModelTables: A Corpus of Tables about Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ModelTables, a benchmark of tables in Model Lakes that captures the structured semantics of performance and configuration tables often overlooked by text only retrieval. The corpus is built from Hugging Face model cards, GitHub READMEs, and referenced papers, linking each table to its surrounding model and publication context. Compared with open data lake tables, model tables are smaller yet exhibit denser inter table relationships, reflecting tightly coupled model and benchmark evolution. The current release covers over 60K models and 90K tables. To evaluate model and table relatedness, we construct a multi source ground truth using three complementary signals: (1) paper citation links, (2) explicit model card links and inheritance, and (3) shared training datasets. We present one extensive empirical use case for the benchmark which is table search. We compare canonical Data Lake search operators (unionable, joinable, keyword) and Information Retrieval baselines (dense, sparse, hybrid retrieval) on this benchmark. Union based semantic table retrieval attains 54.8 % P@1 overall (54.6 % on citation, 31.3 % on inheritance, 30.6 % on shared dataset signals); table based dense retrieval reaches 66.5 % P@1, and metadata hybrid retrieval achieves 54.1 %. This evaluation indicates clear room for developing better table search methods. By releasing ModelTables and its creation protocol, we provide the first large scale benchmark of structured data describing AI model. Our use case of table discovery in Model Lakes, provides intuition and evidence for developing more accurate semantic retrieval, structured comparison, and principled organization of structured model knowledge. Source code, data, and other artifacts have been made available at https://github.com/RJMillerLab/ModelTables.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-based Denoising Defense against Adversarial Attacks on Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based object detection models play a critical role in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and security surveillance systems, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this work, we propose an autoencoder-based denoising defense to recover object detection performance degraded by adversarial perturbations. We conduct adversarial attacks using Perlin noise on vehicle-related images from the COCO dataset, apply a single-layer convolutional autoencoder to remove the perturbations, and evaluate detection performance using YOLOv5. Our experiments demonstrate that adversarial attacks reduce bbox mAP from 0.2890 to 0.1640, representing a 43.3% performance degradation. After applying the proposed autoencoder defense, bbox mAP improves to 0.1700 (3.7% recovery) and bbox mAP@50 increases from 0.2780 to 0.3080 (10.8% improvement). These results indicate that autoencoder-based denoising can provide partial defense against adversarial attacks without requiring model retraining.</description>

Abstract: We present INTELLECT-3, a 106B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model (12B active) trained with large-scale reinforcement learning on our end-to-end RL infrastructure stack. INTELLECT-3 achieves state of the art performance for its size across math, code, science and reasoning benchmarks, outperforming many larger frontier models. We open-source the model together with the full infrastructure stack used to create it, including RL frameworks, complete recipe, and a wide collection of environments, built with the verifiers library, for training and evaluation from our Environments Hub community platform. Built for this effort, we introduce prime-rl, an open framework for large-scale asynchronous reinforcement learning, which scales seamlessly from a single node to thousands of GPUs, and is tailored for agentic RL with first-class support for multi-turn interactions and tool use. Using this stack, we run both SFT and RL training on top of the GLM-4.5-Air-Base model, scaling RL training up to 512 H200s with high training efficiency.</description>

      <title>MRG-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Clinically Aligned Medical Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical report generation (MRG) aims to automatically derive radiology-style reports from medical images to aid in clinical decision-making. However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured "thinking report" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness. This work is a prior to explore semantic-reinforcement in supervising medical correctness in medical Large vision-language model(Med-LVLM) training.</description>

      <title>Decoding Fake Narratives in Spreading Hateful Stories: A Dual-Head RoBERTa Model with Multi-Task Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms, while enabling global connectivity, have become hubs for the rapid spread of harmful content, including hate speech and fake narratives \cite{davidson2017automated, shu2017fake}. The Faux-Hate shared task focuses on detecting a specific phenomenon: the generation of hate speech driven by fake narratives, termed Faux-Hate. Participants are challenged to identify such instances in code-mixed Hindi-English social media text. This paper describes our system developed for the shared task, addressing two primary sub-tasks: (a) Binary Faux-Hate detection, involving fake and hate speech classification, and (b) Target and Severity prediction, categorizing the intended target and severity of hateful content. Our approach combines advanced natural language processing techniques with domain-specific pretraining to enhance performance across both tasks. The system achieved competitive results, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging multi-task learning for this complex problem.</description>

      <title>C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual-Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Directly deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with prompt tuning in downstream UDA tasks faces the signifi cant challenge of mitigating domain discrepancies. Existing prompt-tuning strategies primarily align marginal distribu tion, but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, lead ing to critical issues such as class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability. To address these lim itations, the work proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation. C-DGPA syner gistically optimizes marginal distribution alignment and con ditional distribution alignment through a novel dual-branch architecture. The marginal distribution alignment branch em ploys a dynamic adversarial training framework to bridge marginal distribution discrepancies. Simultaneously, the con ditional distribution alignment branch introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to align conditional distribu tion discrepancies by standardizing semantic prompt under standing and preventing source domain over-reliance. This dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowl edge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensur ing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative repre sentations. Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017 validate the superiority of C-DGPA. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Web toward an agent-centric paradigm, driven by large language models (LLMs), has enabled autonomous agents to reason, plan, and interact in complex decentralized environments. However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized "Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards Closing the Domain Gap with Event Cameras</title>

Abstract: Although traditional cameras are the primary sensor for end-to-end driving, their performance suffers greatly when the conditions of the data they were trained on does not match the deployment environment, a problem known as the domain gap. In this work, we consider the day-night lighting difference domain gap. Instead of traditional cameras we propose event cameras as a potential alternative which can maintain performance across lighting condition domain gaps without requiring additional adjustments. Our results show that event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions, exhibiting domain-shift penalties that are generally comparable to or smaller than grayscale frames and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Open Ad-hoc Categorization with Contextualized Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive categorization of visual scenes is essential for AI agents to handle changing tasks. Unlike fixed common categories for plants or animals, ad-hoc categories are created dynamically to serve specific goals. We study open ad-hoc categorization: Given a few labeled exemplars and abundant unlabeled data, the goal is to discover the underlying context and to expand ad-hoc categories through semantic extension and visual clustering around it.
  Building on the insight that ad-hoc and common categories rely on similar perceptual mechanisms, we propose OAK, a simple model that introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP and optimizes with both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective.
  On Stanford and Clevr-4 datasets, OAK achieves state-of-the-art in accuracy and concept discovery across multiple categorizations, including 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%. Moreover, OAK produces interpretable saliency maps, focusing on hands for Action, faces for Mood, and backgrounds for Location, promoting transparency and trust while enabling adaptive and generalizable categorization.</description>

      <title>Neural emulation of gravity-driven geohazard runout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting geohazard runout is critical for protecting lives, infrastructure and ecosystems. Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting. These results highlight neural emulation as a promising pathway for extending physically realistic geohazard modelling to spatial and temporal scales relevant for large scale early warning systems.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Framework for Robust Large Language Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools in science, technology, and society, enabling transformative advances across diverse fields. However, errors or outdated information within these models can undermine their accuracy and restrict their safe deployment. Developing efficient strategies for updating model knowledge without the expense and disruption of full retraining remains a critical challenge. Current model editing techniques frequently struggle to generalize corrections beyond narrow domains, leading to unintended consequences and limiting their practical impact. Here, we introduce a novel framework for editing LLMs, grounded in information bottleneck theory. This approach precisely compresses and isolates the essential information required for generalizable knowledge correction while minimizing disruption to unrelated model behaviors. Building upon this foundation, we present the Information Bottleneck Knowledge Editor (IBKE), which leverages compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates, enabling robust and broadly applicable model editing. We validate IBKE's effectiveness across multiple LLM architectures and standard benchmark tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and improved generality and specificity of edits. These findings establish a theoretically principled and practical paradigm for open-domain knowledge editing, advancing the utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Dermatological Diagnosis: From Interpretable Models to Clinical Implementation A Comprehensive Framework for Accessible and Trustworthy Skin Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dermatological conditions affect 1.9 billion people globally, yet accurate diagnosis remains challenging due to limited specialist availability and complex clinical presentations. Family history significantly influences skin disease susceptibility and treatment responses, but is often underutilized in diagnostic processes. This research addresses the critical question: How can AI-powered systems integrate family history data with clinical imaging to enhance dermatological diagnosis while supporting clinical trial validation and real-world implementation?
  We developed a comprehensive multi-modal AI framework that combines deep learning-based image analysis with structured clinical data, including detailed family history patterns. Our approach employs interpretable convolutional neural networks integrated with clinical decision trees that incorporate hereditary risk factors. The methodology includes prospective clinical trials across diverse healthcare settings to validate AI-assisted diagnosis against traditional clinical assessment.
  In this work, validation was conducted with healthcare professionals to assess AI-assisted outputs against clinical expectations; prospective clinical trials across diverse healthcare settings are proposed as future work. The integrated AI system demonstrates enhanced diagnostic accuracy when family history data is incorporated, particularly for hereditary skin conditions such as melanoma, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Expert feedback indicates potential for improved early detection and more personalized recommendations; formal clinical trials are planned. The framework is designed for integration into clinical workflows while maintaining interpretability through explainable AI mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Reranking Models in Information Retrieval: From Heuristic Methods to Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reranking is a critical stage in contemporary information retrieval (IR) systems, improving the relevance of the user-presented final results by honing initial candidate sets. This paper is a thorough guide to examine the changing reranker landscape and offer a clear view of the advancements made in reranking methods. We present a comprehensive survey of reranking models employed in IR, particularly within modern Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where retrieved documents notably influence output quality.
  We embark on a chronological journey through the historical trajectory of reranking techniques, starting with foundational approaches, before exploring the wide range of sophisticated neural network architectures such as cross-encoders, sequence-generation models like T5, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilized for structural information. Recognizing the computational cost of advancing neural rerankers, we analyze techniques for enhancing efficiency, notably knowledge distillation for creating competitive, lighter alternatives. Furthermore, we map the emerging territory of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking, examining novel prompting strategies and fine-tuning tactics. This survey seeks to elucidate the fundamental ideas, relative effectiveness, computational features, and real-world trade-offs of various reranking strategies. The survey provides a structured synthesis of the diverse reranking paradigms, highlighting their underlying principles and comparative strengths and weaknesses.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-Fine Open-Set Graph Node Classification with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for foundation models due to its efficient and powerful scalability. In this work, we present Sigma-MoE-Tiny, an MoE language model that achieves the highest sparsity compared to existing open-source models. Sigma-MoE-Tiny employs fine-grained expert segmentation with up to 96 experts per layer, while activating only one expert for each token, resulting in 20B total parameters with just 0.5B activated. The major challenge introduced by such extreme sparsity lies in expert load balancing. We find that the widely-used load balancing loss tends to become ineffective in the lower layers under this setting. To address this issue, we propose a progressive sparsification schedule aiming to balance expert utilization and training stability. Sigma-MoE-Tiny is pre-trained on a diverse and high-quality corpus, followed by post-training to further unlock its capabilities. The entire training process remains remarkably stable, with no occurrence of irrecoverable loss spikes. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that, despite activating only 0.5B parameters, Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves top-tier performance among counterparts of comparable or significantly larger scale. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of load balancing in highly sparse MoE models, offering insights for advancing sparsity in future MoE architectures.

      <title>Interpretable Deep Learning for Stock Returns: A Consensus-Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the \textit{Consensus-Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model} (CB-APM), a partially interpretable neural network that replicates the reasoning processes of sell-side analysts by capturing how dispersed investor beliefs are compressed into asset prices through a consensus formation process. By modeling this ``bottleneck'' to summarize firm- and macro-level information, CB-APM not only predicts future risk premiums of U.S. equities but also links belief aggregation to expected returns in a structurally interpretable manner. The model improves long-horizon return forecasts and outperforms standard deep learning approaches in both predictive accuracy and explanatory power. Comprehensive portfolio analyses show that CB-APM's out-of-sample predictions translate into economically meaningful payoffs, with monotonic return differentials and stable long-short performance across regularization settings. Empirically, CB-APM leverages consensus as a regularizer to amplify long-horizon predictability and yields interpretable consensus-based components that clarify how information is priced in returns. Moreover, regression and GRS-based pricing diagnostics reveal that the learned consensus representations capture priced variation only partially spanned by traditional factor models, demonstrating that CB-APM uncovers belief-driven structure in expected returns beyond the canonical factor space. Overall, CB-APM provides an interpretable and empirically grounded framework for understanding belief-driven return dynamics.</description>

      <title>TextEditBench: Evaluating Reasoning-aware Text Editing Beyond Rendering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text rendering has recently emerged as one of the most challenging frontiers in visual generation, drawing significant attention from large-scale diffusion and multimodal models. However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration. By focusing evaluation on this long-overlooked yet fundamental capability, TextEditBench establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation.</description>

      <title>Domain-Agnostic Causal-Aware Audio Transformer for Infant Cry Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of infant cry paralinguistics is essential for early detection of neonatal distress and clinical decision support. However, many existing deep learning methods rely on correlation-driven acoustic representations, which makes them vulnerable to noise, spurious cues, and domain shifts across recording environments. We propose DACH-TIC, a Domain-Agnostic Causal-Aware Hierarchical Audio Transformer for robust infant cry classification. The model integrates causal attention, hierarchical representation learning, multi-task supervision, and adversarial domain generalization within a unified framework.
  DACH-TIC employs a structured transformer backbone with local token-level and global semantic encoders, augmented by causal attention masking and controlled perturbation training to approximate counterfactual acoustic variations. A domain-adversarial objective promotes environment-invariant representations, while multi-task learning jointly optimizes cry type recognition, distress intensity estimation, and causal relevance prediction. The model is evaluated on the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets, with ESC-50 environmental noise overlays for domain augmentation.
  Experimental results show that DACH-TIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including HTS-AT and SE-ResNet Transformer, achieving improvements of 2.6 percent in accuracy and 2.2 points in macro-F1 score, alongside enhanced causal fidelity. The model generalizes effectively to unseen acoustic environments, with a domain performance gap of only 2.4 percent, demonstrating its suitability for real-world neonatal acoustic monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Blind Spots: Analytic Hints for Mitigating LLM-Based Evaluation Pitfalls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as judges (LaaJ) in code generation pipelines. While attractive for scalability, LaaJs tend to overlook domain specific issues raising concerns about their reliability in critical evaluation tasks. To better understand these limitations in practice, we examine LaaJ behavior in a concrete industrial use case: legacy code modernization via COBOL code generation. In this setting, we find that even production deployed LaaJs can miss domain critical errors, revealing consistent blind spots in their evaluation capabilities.
  To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy. Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice. We use its outputs as analytic hints, dynamically injecting them into the judges prompt to encourage LaaJ to revisit aspects it may have overlooked.
  Experiments on a test set of 100 programs using four production level LaaJs show that LaaJ alone detects only about 45% of the errors present in the code (in all judges we tested), while the analytic checker alone lacks explanatory depth. When combined, the LaaJ+Hints configuration achieves up to 94% coverage (for the best performing judge and injection prompt) and produces qualitatively richer, more accurate explanations, demonstrating that analytic-LLM hybrids can substantially enhance evaluation reliability in deployed pipelines. We release the dataset and all used prompts.</description>

      <title>GFLAN: Generative Functional Layouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.</description>

      <title>Love, Lies, and Language Models: Investigating AI's Role in Romance-Baiting Scams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Romance-baiting scams have become a major source of financial and emotional harm worldwide. These operations are run by organized crime syndicates that traffic thousands of people into forced labor, requiring them to build emotional intimacy with victims over weeks of text conversations before pressuring them into fraudulent cryptocurrency investments. Because the scams are inherently text-based, they raise urgent questions about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both current and future automation.
  We investigate this intersection by interviewing 145 insiders and 5 scam victims, performing a blinded long-term conversation study comparing LLM scam agents to human operators, and executing an evaluation of commercial safety filters. Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans). Meanwhile, popular safety filters detected 0.0% of romance baiting dialogues. Together, these results suggest that romance-baiting scams may be amenable to full-scale LLM automation, while existing defenses remain inadequate to prevent their expansion.</description>

      <title>CKA-Guided Modular Quantization: Beyond Bit-Width to Algorithmic Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current mainstream post-training quantization methods for large language models typically apply a uniform quantization strategy across all network layers, overlooking the substantial differences in algorithmic suitability among layers. To address this limitation, we propose CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization. Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer. The individually optimized strategies are then integrated to construct a hybrid quantized model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods across mainstream LLMs including LLaMA and Qwen ,in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance.</description>

      <title>Feature-Selective Representation Misdirection for Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on. Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications. We release the replication package at https://figshare.com/s/d5931192a8824de26aff.</description>

      <title>PixelArena: A benchmark for Pixel-Precision Visual Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models that have image output are emerging. Many image generation benchmarks focus on aesthetics instead of fine-grained generation capabilities. In PixelArena, we propose using semantic segmentation tasks to objectively examine their fine-grained generative intelligence with pixel precision. We find the latest Gemini 3 Pro Image has emergent image generation capabilities that generate semantic masks with high fidelity under zero-shot settings, showcasing visual intelligence unseen before and true generalization in new image generation tasks. We further investigate its results, compare them qualitatively and quantitatively with those of other models, and present failure cases. The findings not only signal exciting progress in the field but also provide insights into future research related to multimodality, reasoning, interpretability and benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Benchmark: Innovative Defenses Against Prompt Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this fast-evolving area of LLMs, our paper discusses the significant security risk presented by prompt injection attacks. It focuses on small open-sourced models, specifically the LLaMA family of models. We introduce novel defense mechanisms capable of generating automatic defenses and systematically evaluate said generated defenses against a comprehensive set of benchmarked attacks. Thus, we empirically demonstrated the improvement proposed by our approach in mitigating goal-hijacking vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our work recognizes the increasing relevance of small open-sourced LLMs and their potential for broad deployments on edge devices, aligning with future trends in LLM applications. We contribute to the greater ecosystem of open-source LLMs and their security in the following: (1) assessing present prompt-based defenses against the latest attacks, (2) introducing a new framework using a seed defense (Chain Of Thoughts) to refine the defense prompts iteratively, and (3) showing significant improvements in detecting goal hijacking attacks. Out strategies significantly reduce the success rates of the attacks and false detection rates while at the same time effectively detecting goal-hijacking capabilities, paving the way for more secure and efficient deployments of small and open-source LLMs in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Agent Tools Orchestration Leaks More: Dataset, Benchmark, and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by Large Language Models, the single-agent, multi-tool architecture has become a popular paradigm for autonomous agents due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, this architecture also introduces a new and severe privacy risk, which we term Tools Orchestration Privacy Risk (TOP-R), where an agent, to achieve a benign user goal, autonomously aggregates information fragments across multiple tools and leverages its reasoning capabilities to synthesize unexpected sensitive information. We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624. Our work reveals both a new class of risk and inherent structural limitations in current agent architectures, while also offering feasible mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT): A battery life prediction foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early prediction of battery cycle life is essential for accelerating battery research, manufacturing, and deployment. Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries of LIBs. This work establishes a foundation model pathway for battery lifetime prediction, paving the way toward universal battery lifetime prediction systems.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Edge-to-Server Inference for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hearing to Translate: The Effectiveness of Speech Modality Integration into LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.</description>

      <title>Kascade: A Practical Sparse Attention Method for Long-Context LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.</description>

      <title>Using Gaussian Splats to Create High-Fidelity Facial Geometry and Texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We leverage increasingly popular three-dimensional neural representations in order to construct a unified and consistent explanation of a collection of uncalibrated images of the human face. Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by illustrating its use in a text-driven asset creation pipeline.</description>

      <title>Hypernetworks That Evolve Themselves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can neural networks evolve themselves without relying on external optimizers? We propose Self-Referential Graph HyperNetworks, systems where the very machinery of variation and inheritance is embedded within the network. By uniting hypernetworks, stochastic parameter generation, and graph-based representations, Self-Referential GHNs mutate and evaluate themselves while adapting mutation rates as selectable traits. Through new reinforcement learning benchmarks with environmental shifts (CartPoleSwitch, LunarLander-Switch), Self-Referential GHNs show swift, reliable adaptation and emergent population dynamics. In the locomotion benchmark Ant-v5, they evolve coherent gaits, showing promising fine-tuning capabilities by autonomously decreasing variation in the population to concentrate around promising solutions. Our findings support the idea that evolvability itself can emerge from neural self-reference. Self-Referential GHNs reflect a step toward synthetic systems that more closely mirror biological evolution, offering tools for autonomous, open-ended learning agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the volume of published scholarly literature continues to grow, finding relevant literature becomes increasingly difficult. With the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), and particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), new possibilities emerge to find and explore literature. We introduce ASK (Assistant for Scientific Knowledge), an AI-driven scholarly literature search and exploration system that follows a neuro-symbolic approach. ASK aims to provide active support to researchers in finding relevant scholarly literature by leveraging vector search, LLMs, and knowledge graphs. The system allows users to input research questions in natural language and retrieve relevant articles. ASK automatically extracts key information and generates answers to research questions using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. We present an evaluation of ASK, assessing the system's usability and usefulness. Findings indicate that the system is user-friendly and users are generally satisfied while using the system.</description>

      <title>Emergent Bias and Fairness in Multi-Agent Decision Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems have demonstrated the ability to improve performance on a variety of predictive tasks by leveraging collaborative decision making. However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.</description>

Abstract: Choosing the number of topics $T$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a key design decision that strongly affects both the statistical fit and interpretability of topic models. In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.</description>

      <title>E-SDS: Environment-aware See it, Do it, Sorted - Automated Environment-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16446</link>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in automating reward design in humanoid locomotion, which could eliminate the need for tedious manual engineering. However, current VLM-based methods are essentially "blind", as they lack the environmental perception required to navigate complex terrain. We present E-SDS (Environment-aware See it, Do it, Sorted), a framework that closes this perception gap. E-SDS integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions that facilitate training of robust perceptive locomotion policies, grounded by example videos. Evaluated on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four distinct terrains (simple, gaps, obstacles, stairs), E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent, while policies trained with manually-designed rewards or a non-perceptive automated baseline were unable to complete the task. In all terrains, E-SDS also reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%. Our framework reduces the human effort of reward design from days to less than two hours while simultaneously producing more robust and capable locomotion policies.</description>

      <title>IoMT-based Automated Leukemia Classification using CNN and Higher Order Singular Value</title>

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept by which objects find identity and can communicate with each other in a network. One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step.</description>

      <title>Guiding Perception-Reasoning Closer to Human in Blind Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, integrating sensory cues with implicit reasoning to form self-consistent judgments. In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.</description>

      <title>Smile on the Face, Sadness in the Eyes: Bridging the Emotion Gap with a Multimodal Dataset of Eye and Facial Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion Recognition (ER) is the process of analyzing and identifying human emotions from sensing data. Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance. Our EMER dataset and the trained EMERT models will be publicly available at https://github.com/kejun1/EMER.</description>

      <title>PoseMoE: Mixture-of-Experts Network for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lifting-based methods have dominated monocular 3D human pose estimation by leveraging detected 2D poses as intermediate representations. The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.</description>

Abstract: Achieving high efficiency on AI operators demands precise control over computation and data movement. However, existing scheduling languages are locked into specific compiler ecosystems, preventing fair comparison, reuse, and evaluation across frameworks. No unified interface currently decouples scheduling specification from code generation and measurement. We introduce XTC, a platform that unifies scheduling and performance evaluation across compilers. With its common API and reproducible measurement framework, XTC enables portable experimentation and accelerates research on optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>The Universe Learning Itself: On the Evolution of Dynamics from the Big Bang to Machine Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified, dynamical-systems narrative of the universe that traces a continuous chain of structure formation from the Big Bang to contemporary human societies and their artificial learning systems. Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories.</description>

      <title>TTP: Test-Time Padding for Adversarial Detection and Robust Adaptation on Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigated the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simplifying biomedical texts to enhance health literacy. Using a public dataset, which included plain language adaptations of biomedical abstracts, we developed and evaluated several approaches, specifically a baseline approach using a prompt template, a two AI agent approach, and a fine-tuning approach. We selected OpenAI gpt-4o and gpt-4o mini models as baselines for further research. We evaluated our approaches with quantitative metrics, such as Flesch-Kincaid grade level, SMOG Index, SARI, and BERTScore, G-Eval, as well as with qualitative metric, more precisely 5-point Likert scales for simplicity, accuracy, completeness, brevity. Results showed a superior performance of gpt-4o-mini and an underperformance of FT approaches. G-Eval, a LLM based quantitative metric, showed promising results, ranking the approaches similarly as the qualitative metric.</description>

      <title>Yuan-TecSwin: A text conditioned Diffusion model with Swin-transformer blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis based on their U-shaped architecture and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as basic blocks. The locality of the convolution operation in CNN may limit the model's ability to understand long-range semantic information. To address this issue, we propose Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer in this work. The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones.</description>

      <title>Refusal Steering: Fine-grained Control over LLM Refusal Behaviour for Sensitive Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Refusal Steering, an inference-time method to exercise fine-grained control over Large Language Models refusal behaviour on politically sensitive topics without retraining. We replace fragile pattern-based refusal detection with an LLM-as-a-judge that assigns refusal confidence scores and we propose a ridge-regularized variant to compute steering vectors that better isolate the refusal--compliance direction. On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, our method removes the refusal behaviour of the model around politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired. We analize the steering vectors and show that refusal signals concentrate in deeper layers of the transformer and are distributed across many dimensions. Together, these results demonstrate that activation steering can remove political refusal behaviour while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback: Preference Optimization as a Sequential Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a new framework for preference optimization. SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Protecting Deep Neural Network Intellectual Property with Chaos-Based White-Box Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of deep neural networks (DNNs) across several domains has led to increasing concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection and model misuse. Trained DNNs represent valuable assets, often developed through significant investments. However, the ease with which models can be copied, redistributed, or repurposed highlights the urgent need for effective mechanisms to assert and verify model ownership. In this work, we propose an efficient and resilient white-box watermarking framework that embeds ownership information into the internal parameters of a DNN using chaotic sequences. The watermark is generated using a logistic map, a well-known chaotic function, producing a sequence that is sensitive to its initialization parameters. This sequence is injected into the weights of a chosen intermediate layer without requiring structural modifications to the model or degradation in predictive performance. To validate ownership, we introduce a verification process based on a genetic algorithm that recovers the original chaotic parameters by optimizing the similarity between the extracted and regenerated sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that the embedded watermark remains detectable after fine-tuning, with negligible loss in model accuracy. In addition to numerical recovery of the watermark, we perform visual analyses using weight density plots and construct activation-based classifiers to distinguish between original, watermarked, and tampered models. Overall, the proposed method offers a flexible and scalable solution for embedding and verifying model ownership in white-box settings well-suited for real-world scenarios where IP protection is critical.</description>

Abstract: In today's information-driven world, access to scientific publications has become increasingly easy. At the same time, filtering through the massive volume of available research has become more challenging than ever. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and graph attention mechanisms have shown strong effectiveness in searching large-scale information databases, particularly when combined with modern large language models. In this paper, we propose an Attention-Based Subgraph Retriever, a GNN-as-retriever model that applies attention-based pruning to extract a refined subgraph, which is then passed to a large language model for advanced knowledge reasoning.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Fingerprinting Subject Re-Identification in 3D-MRI and 2D-X-Ray</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining open-source datasets can introduce data leakage if the same subject appears in multiple sets, leading to inflated model performance. To address this, we explore subject fingerprinting, mapping all images of a subject to a distinct region in latent space, to enable subject re-identification via similarity matching. Using a ResNet-50 trained with triplet margin loss, we evaluate few-shot fingerprinting on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data in both standard (20-way 1-shot) and challenging (1000-way 1-shot) scenarios. The model achieves high Mean- Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS- 2021.</description>

      <title>Towards Reproducibility in Predictive Process Mining: SPICE - A Deep Learning Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Predictive Process Mining (PPM) techniques based on artificial neural networks have evolved as a method for monitoring the future behavior of unfolding business processes and predicting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). However, many PPM approaches often lack reproducibility, transparency in decision making, usability for incorporating novel datasets and benchmarking, making comparisons among different implementations very difficult. In this paper, we propose SPICE, a Python framework that reimplements three popular, existing baseline deep-learning-based methods for PPM in PyTorch, while designing a common base framework with rigorous configurability to enable reproducible and robust comparison of past and future modelling approaches. We compare SPICE to original reported metrics and with fair metrics on 11 datasets.</description>

Abstract: Reducing computational complexity remains a critical challenge for the widespread adoption of learning-based image compression techniques. In this work, we propose TreeNet, a novel low-complexity image compression model that leverages a binary tree-structured encoder-decoder architecture to achieve efficient representation and reconstruction. We employ attentional feature fusion mechanism to effectively integrate features from multiple branches. We evaluate TreeNet on three widely used benchmark datasets and compare its performance against competing methods including JPEG AI, a recent standard in learning-based image compression. At low bitrates, TreeNet achieves an average improvement of 4.83% in BD-rate over JPEG AI, while reducing model complexity by 87.82%. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies to investigate the influence of various latent representations within TreeNet, offering deeper insights into the factors contributing to reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Plausibility as Failure: How LLMs and Humans Co-Construct Epistemic Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as epistemic partners in everyday reasoning, yet their errors remain predominantly analyzed through predictive metrics rather than through their interpretive effects on human judgment. This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication.</description>

      <title>GinSign: Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural language (NL) to temporal logic (TL) translation enables engineers to specify, verify, and enforce system behaviors without manually crafting formal specifications-an essential capability for building trustworthy autonomous systems. While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\%$, a $1.4\times$ improvement over SOTA.</description>

Abstract: We present a new use of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to discover the molecular structure of chemical samples based on the relative abundance of elements and structural fragments, as measured in mass spectrometry. To constrain the exponential search space for this combinatorial problem, we develop canonical representations of molecular structures and an ASP implemen- tation that uses these definitions. We evaluate the correctness of our implementation over a large set of known molecular structures, and we compare its quality and performance to other ASP symmetry-breaking methods and to a commercial tool from analytical chemistry.

      <title>KineST: A Kinematics-guided Spatiotemporal State Space Model for Human Motion Tracking from Sparse Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-body motion tracking plays an essential role in AR/VR applications, bridging physical and virtual interactions. However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework.

      <title>Delay-Aware Multi-Stage Edge Server Upgrade with Budget Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Multi-stage Edge Server Upgrade (M-ESU) is proposed as a new network planning problem, involving the upgrading of an existing multi-access edge computing (MEC) system through multiple stages (e.g., over several years). More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.</description>

      <title>From Facts to Conclusions : Integrating Deductive Reasoning in Retrieval-Augmented LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in external evidence, but fails when retrieved sources conflict or contain outdated or subjective information. Prior work address these issues independently but lack unified reasoning supervision. We propose a reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework that adds structured, interpretable reasoning across three stages : (1) document-level adjudication, (2) conflict analysis, and (3) grounded synthesis, producing citation-linked answers or justified refusals. A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline is introduced which evaluates groundedness, factual correctness, refusal accuracy, and conflict-behavior alignment using an LLM-as-a-Judge. Our 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline establish a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems. Experimental results demonstrate substantial gains over baselines, most notably with Qwen, where Supervised Fine-Tuning improved End-to-End answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Anti-Jamming Resilience in Swarm Networks via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reactive jammers pose a severe security threat to robotic-swarm networks by selectively disrupting inter-agent communications and undermining formation integrity and mission success. Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.</description>

      <title>Grammar-Forced Translation of Natural Language to Temporal Logic using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translating natural language (NL) into a formal language such as temporal logic (TL) is integral for human communication with robots and autonomous systems. State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation License Plate Detection and Recognition System using YOLOv8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of traffic management and vehicle surveillance, efficient license plate detection and recognition are indispensable. Historically, many methodologies have tackled this challenge, but consistent real-time accuracy, especially in diverse environments, remains elusive. This study examines the performance of YOLOv8 variants on License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Character Recognition tasks, crucial for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Two distinct datasets were employed for training and evaluation, yielding notable findings. The YOLOv8 Nano variant demonstrated a precision of 0.964 and mAP50 of 0.918 on the LPR task, while the YOLOv8 Small variant exhibited a precision of 0.92 and mAP50 of 0.91 on the Character Recognition task. A custom method for character sequencing was introduced, effectively sequencing the detected characters based on their x-axis positions. An optimized pipeline, utilizing YOLOv8 Nano for LPR and YOLOv8 Small for Character Recognition, is proposed. This configuration not only maintains computational efficiency but also ensures high accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for future real-world deployments on edge devices within Intelligent Transportation Systems. This effort marks a significant stride towards the development of smarter and more efficient urban infrastructures.</description>

      <title>OPENTOUCH: Bringing Full-Hand Touch to Real-World Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human hand is our primary interface to the physical world, yet egocentric perception rarely knows when, where, or how forcefully it makes contact. Robust wearable tactile sensors are scarce, and no existing in-the-wild datasets align first-person video with full-hand touch. To bridge the gap between visual perception and physical interaction, we present OpenTouch, the first in-the-wild egocentric full-hand tactile dataset, containing 5.1 hours of synchronized video-touch-pose data and 2,900 curated clips with detailed text annotations. Using OpenTouch, we introduce retrieval and classification benchmarks that probe how touch grounds perception and action. We show that tactile signals provide a compact yet powerful cue for grasp understanding, strengthen cross-modal alignment, and can be reliably retrieved from in-the-wild video queries. By releasing this annotated vision-touch-pose dataset and benchmark, we aim to advance multimodal egocentric perception, embodied learning, and contact-rich robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>LLMCache: Layer-Wise Caching Strategies for Accelerated Reuse in Transformer Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their high inference latency poses a significant challenge for real-timeand large-scale deployment. While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with &lt;0.5% accuracy degradation. Our results highlight LLMCache as a practical and general-purpose solution for optimizing transformer inference in real-world applications</description>

      <title>Meta-RL Induces Exploration in Language Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.</description>

      <title>PrivateXR: Defending Privacy Attacks in Extended Reality Through Explainable AI-Guided Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial AI and XR technologies (AI XR) promises innovative applications across many domains. However, the sensitive nature of data (e.g., eye-tracking) used in these systems raises significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit these data and models to infer and leak personal information through membership inference attacks (MIA) and re-identification (RDA) with a high success rate. Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate such privacy attacks, including differential privacy (DP). However, AI XR datasets often contain numerous features, and applying DP uniformly can introduce unnecessary noise to less relevant features, degrade model accuracy, and increase inference time, limiting real-time XR deployment. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and DP-enabled privacy-preserving mechanisms to defend against privacy attacks. Specifically, we leverage post-hoc explanations to identify the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively apply DP to those features during inference. We evaluate our XAI-guided DP approach on three state-of-the-art AI XR models and three datasets: cybersickness, emotion, and activity classification. Our results show that the proposed method reduces MIA and RDA success rates by up to 43% and 39%, respectively, for cybersickness tasks while preserving model utility with up to 97% accuracy using Transformer models. Furthermore, it improves inference time by up to ~2x compared to traditional DP approaches. To demonstrate practicality, we deploy the XAI-guided DP AI XR models on an HTC VIVE Pro headset and develop a user interface (UI), namely PrivateXR, allowing users to adjust privacy levels (e.g., low, medium, high) while receiving real-time task predictions, protecting user privacy during XR gameplay.</description>

      <title>GenEval 2: Addressing Benchmark Drift in Text-to-Image Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating Text-to-Image (T2I) model evaluation is challenging; a judge model must be used to score correctness, and test prompts must be selected to be challenging for current T2I models but not the judge. We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>ReinforceGen: Hybrid Skill Policies with Automated Data Generation and Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon manipulation has been a long-standing challenge in the robotics community. We propose ReinforceGen, a system that combines task decomposition, data generation, imitation learning, and motion planning to form an initial solution, and improves each component through reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning. ReinforceGen first segments the task into multiple localized skills, which are connected through motion planning. The skills and motion planning targets are trained with imitation learning on a dataset generated from 10 human demonstrations, and then fine-tuned through online adaptation and reinforcement learning. When benchmarked on the Robosuite dataset, ReinforceGen reaches 80% success rate on all tasks with visuomotor controls in the highest reset range setting. Additional ablation studies show that our fine-tuning approaches contributes to an 89% average performance increase. More results and videos available in https://reinforcegen.github.io/</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Online Learning on the Edge by Transforming Knowledge from Teacher Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: "How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.</description>

      <title>Sequencing to Mitigate Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.</description>

      <title>Pixel Seal: Adversarial-only training for invisible image and video watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invisible watermarking is essential for tracing the provenance of digital content. However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings.</description>

      <title>Training Together, Diagnosing Better: Federated Learning for Collagen VI-Related Dystrophies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.</description>

      <title>LinkedOut: Linking World Knowledge Representation Out of Video LLM for Next-Generation Video Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Racial Bias in Historical Training Data for News AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI technologies have rapidly moved into business and research applications that involve large text corpora, including computational journalism research and newsroom settings. These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning "blacks" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the "blacks" label operates partially as a general "racism detector" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.</description>

      <title>Flowing from Reasoning to Motion: Learning 3D Hand Trajectory Prediction from Egocentric Human Interaction Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior works on 3D hand trajectory prediction are constrained by datasets that decouple motion from semantic supervision and by models that weakly link reasoning and action. To address these, we first present the EgoMAN dataset, a large-scale egocentric dataset for interaction stage-aware 3D hand trajectory prediction with 219K 6DoF trajectories and 3M structured QA pairs for semantic, spatial, and motion reasoning. We then introduce the EgoMAN model, a reasoning-to-motion framework that links vision-language reasoning and motion generation via a trajectory-token interface. Trained progressively to align reasoning with motion dynamics, our approach yields accurate and stage-aware trajectories with generalization across real-world scenes.</description>

      <title>Posterior Behavioral Cloning: Pretraining BC Policies for Efficient RL Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.</description>

      <title>Exploration v.s. Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.</description>

      <title>DVGT: Driving Visual Geometry Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 3D scene geometry from visual inputs is crucial for autonomous driving. However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors. Trained on a large mixture of driving datasets including nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, and DDAD, DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/wzzheng/DVGT.</description>

      <title>EasyV2V: A High-quality Instruction-based Video Editing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While image editing has advanced rapidly, video editing remains less explored, facing challenges in consistency, control, and generalization. We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduce \emph{EasyV2V}, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing. On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images. Overall, EasyV2V works with flexible inputs, e.g., video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text, and achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.

      <title>Differences That Matter: Auditing Models for Capability Gap Discovery and Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.</description>

      <title>Enter the Void - Planning to Seek Entropy When Reward is Scarce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers an intuitive way to increase the sample efficiency of model-free RL methods by simultaneously training a world model that learns to predict the future. These models constitute the large majority of training compute and time and they are subsequently used to train actors entirely in simulation, but once this is done they are quickly discarded. We show in this work that utilising these models at inference time can significantly boost sample efficiency. We propose a novel approach that anticipates and actively seeks out informative states using the world model's short-horizon latent predictions, offering a principled alternative to traditional curiosity-driven methods that chase outdated estimates of high uncertainty states. While many model predictive control (MPC) based methods offer similar alternatives, they typically lack commitment, synthesising multiple multi-step plans at every step. To mitigate this, we present a hierarchical planner that dynamically decides when to replan, planning horizon length, and the commitment to searching entropy. While our method can theoretically be applied to any model that trains its own actors with solely model generated data, we have applied it to Dreamer to illustrate the concept. Our method finishes MiniWorld's procedurally generated mazes 50% faster than base Dreamer at convergence and in only 60% of the environment steps that base Dreamer's policy needs; it displays reasoned exploratory behaviour in Crafter, achieves the same reward as base Dreamer in a third of the steps; planning tends to improve sample efficiency on DeepMind Control tasks.</description>

      <title>TRiSM for Agentic AI: A Review of Trust, Risk, and Security Management in LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04133v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems, built upon large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligence, autonomy, collaboration, and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around key pillars: \textit{ Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy} and \textit{their Lifecycle Governance}, each contextualized to the challenges of AMAS. A risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI, as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, highlighting key directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles-ensuring safety, transparency, and accountability in their operation.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of intelligent agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping the pervasive computing field. Their ability to perceive, reason, and act through natural language understanding enables autonomous problem-solving in complex pervasive environments, including the management of heterogeneous sensors, devices, and data. This survey outlines the architectural components of LLM agents (profiling, memory, planning, and action) and examines their deployment and evaluation across various scenarios. Than it reviews computational and infrastructural advancements (cloud to edge) in pervasive computing and how AI is moving in this field. It highlights state-of-the-art agent deployment strategies and applications, including local and distributed execution on resource-constrained devices. This survey identifies key challenges of these agents in pervasive computing such as architectural, energetic and privacy limitations. It finally proposes what we called "Agent as a Tool", a conceptual framework for pervasive agentic AI, emphasizing context awareness, modularity, security, efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical GraphRAG: Efficient Knowledge Graph Construction and Hybrid Retrieval at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi- hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited due to reliance on expensive large language model (LLM)-based extraction and complex traversal strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) an efficient knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages dependency parsing to achieve 94% of LLM-based performance (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing costs and improving scalability; and (2) a hybrid retrieval strategy that fuses vector similarity with graph traversal using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), maintaining separate embeddings for entities, chunks, and relations to enable multi-granular matching. We evaluate our framework on two enterprise datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate improvements of up to 15% and 4.35% over vanilla vector retrieval baselines using LLM-as-Judge evaluation metrics. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG in production enterprise environments, demonstrating that careful engineering of classical NLP techniques can match modern LLM-based approaches while enabling practical, cost-effective, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning at scale.</description>

      <title>SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8977 (95% CI: 0.88-0.91). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.</description>

      <title>MoHoBench: Assessing Honesty of Multimodal Large Language Models via Unanswerable Visual Questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly, especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/yanxuzhu/MoHoBench.</description>

      <title>MEML-GRPO: Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Mutual Learning for RLVR Advancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR faces challenges with reward sparsity, where zero rewards from consistently incorrect candidate answers provide no learning signal, particularly in challenging tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Expert Mutual Learning GRPO (MEML-GRPO), an innovative framework that utilizes diverse expert prompts as system prompts to generate a broader range of responses, substantially increasing the likelihood of identifying correct solutions. Additionally, we introduce an inter-expert mutual learning mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing and transfer among experts, further boosting the model's performance through RLVR. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that MEML-GRPO delivers significant improvements, achieving an average performance gain of 4.89% with Qwen and 11.33% with Llama, effectively overcoming the core limitations of traditional RLVR methods.</description>

      <title>Scaling Neuro-symbolic Problem Solving: Solver-Free Learning of Constraints and Objectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20978v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets, there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.</description>

      <title>D2E: Scaling Vision-Action Pretraining on Desktop Data for Transfer to Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection. Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/</description>

      <title>ProtoSiTex: Learning Semi-Interpretable Prototypes for Multi-label Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated text across digital platforms has intensified the need for interpretable models capable of fine-grained text classification and explanation. Existing prototype-based models offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity (sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex employs a dual-phase alternate training strategy: an unsupervised prototype discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across subsentence, sentence, and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the subsentence level with multiple labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.</description>

      <title>KarmaTS: A Universal Simulation Platform for Multivariate Time Series with Functional Causal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce KarmaTS, an interactive framework for constructing lag-indexed, executable spatiotemporal causal graphical models for multivariate time series (MTS) simulation. Motivated by the challenge of access-restricted physiological data, KarmaTS generates synthetic MTS with known causal dynamics and augments real-world datasets with expert knowledge. The system constructs a discrete-time structural causal process (DSCP) by combining expert knowledge and algorithmic proposals in a mixed-initiative, human-in-the-loop workflow. The resulting DSCP supports simulation and causal interventions, including those under user-specified distribution shifts. KarmaTS handles mixed variable types, contemporaneous and lagged edges, and modular edge functionals ranging from parameterizable templates to neural network models. Together, these features enable flexible validation and benchmarking of causal discovery algorithms through expert-informed simulation.</description>

      <title>N2N: A Parallel Framework for Large-Scale MILP under Distributed Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18723v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&amp;B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.</description>

      <title>Toward Closed-loop Molecular Discovery via Language Model, Property Alignment and Strategic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drug discovery is a time-consuming and expensive process, with traditional high-throughput and docking-based virtual screening hampered by low success rates and limited scalability. Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets. Experimental results show that Trio reliably achieves chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%) and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold. By combining generalization, plausibility, and interpretability, Trio establishes a closed-loop generative paradigm that redefines how chemical space can be navigated, offering a transformative foundation for the next era of AI-driven drug discovery.</description>

      <title>TiCard: Deployable EXPLAIN-only Residual Learning for Cardinality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a key bottleneck for cost-based query optimization, yet deployable improvements remain difficult: classical estimators miss correlations, while learned estimators often require workload-specific training pipelines and invasive integration into the optimizer. This paper presents TiCard, a low intrusion, correction-based framework that augments (rather than replaces) a database's native estimator. TiCard learns multiplicative residual corrections using EXPLAIN-only features, and uses EXPLAIN ANALYZE only for offline labels. We study two practical instantiations: (i) a Gradient Boosting Regressor for sub-millisecond inference, and (ii) TabPFN, an in-context tabular foundation model that adapts by refreshing a small reference set without gradient retraining. On TiDB with TPCH and the Join Order Benchmark, in a low-trace setting (263 executions total; 157 used for learning), TiCard improves operator-level tail accuracy substantially: P90 Q-error drops from 312.85 (native) to 13.69 (TiCard-GBR), and P99 drops from 37,974.37 to 3,416.50 (TiCard-TabPFN), while a join-only policy preserves near-perfect median behavior. We position TiCard as an AI4DB building block focused on deployability: explicit scope, conservative integration policies, and an integration roadmap from offline correction to in-optimizer use.</description>

      <title>LADY: Linear Attention for Autonomous Driving Efficiency without Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end paradigms have demonstrated great potential for autonomous driving. Additionally, most existing methods are built upon Transformer architectures. However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms. As autonomous driving inherently demands efficient temporal modeling, this challenge severely limits their deployment and real-time performance. Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose LADY, the first fully linear attention-based generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving. LADY enables fusion of long-range temporal context at inference with constant computational and memory costs, regardless of the history length of camera and LiDAR features. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight linear cross-attention mechanism that enables effective cross-modal information exchange. Experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that LADY achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant-time and memory complexity, offering improved planning performance and significantly reduced computational cost. Additionally, the model has been deployed and validated on edge devices, demonstrating its practicality in resource-limited scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bandits with Preference Feedback: A Stackelberg Game Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bandits with preference feedback present a powerful tool for optimizing unknown target functions when only pairwise comparisons are allowed instead of direct value queries. This model allows for incorporating human feedback into online inference and optimization and has been employed in systems for fine-tuning large language models. The problem is well understood in simplified settings with linear target functions or over finite small domains that limit practical interest. Taking the next step, we consider infinite domains and nonlinear (kernelized) rewards. In this setting, selecting a pair of actions is quite challenging and requires balancing exploration and exploitation at two levels: within the pair, and along the iterations of the algorithm. We propose MAXMINLCB, which emulates this trade-off as a zero-sum Stackelberg game, and chooses action pairs that are informative and yield favorable rewards. MAXMINLCB consistently outperforms existing algorithms and satisfies an anytime-valid rate-optimal regret guarantee. This is due to our novel preference-based confidence sequences for kernelized logistic estimators.</description>

      <title>WildFit: Autonomous In-situ Model Adaptation for Resource-Constrained IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07796v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resource-constrained IoT devices increasingly rely on deep learning models, however, these models experience significant accuracy drops due to domain shifts when encountering variations in lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. While cloud-based retraining can address this issue, many IoT deployments operate with limited connectivity and energy constraints, making traditional fine-tuning approaches impractical. We explore this challenge through the lens of wildlife ecology, where camera traps must maintain accurate species classification across changing seasons, weather, and habitats without reliable connectivity. We introduce WildFit, an autonomous in-situ adaptation framework that leverages the key insight that background scenes change more frequently than the visual characteristics of monitored species. WildFit combines background-aware synthesis to generate training samples on-device with drift-aware fine-tuning that triggers model updates only when necessary to conserve resources. Our background-aware synthesis surpasses efficient baselines by 7.3% and diffusion models by 3.0% while being orders of magnitude faster, our drift-aware fine-tuning achieves Pareto optimality with 50% fewer updates and 1.5% higher accuracy, and the end-to-end system outperforms domain adaptation approaches by 20-35% while consuming only 11.2 Wh over 37 days-enabling battery-powered deployment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Long-term RAG Chatbots with Psychological Models of Memory Importance and Forgetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing long-term conversations, the increasing memory load as conversations progress degrades retrieval accuracy. Drawing on psychological insights, we propose LUFY, a simple yet effective method that focuses on emotionally arousing memories and retains less than 10% of the conversation. In the user experiment, participants interacted with three types of RAG chatbots, each for 2 hours over 4 sessions, marking the most extensive assessment of a chatbot's long-term capabilities to date -- more than four times longer than any existing benchmark. The results demonstrate that prioritizing arousing memories while forgetting the majority of the conversation significantly enhances user experience. This study pushes the frontier of long-term conversations and highlights the importance of forgetting unimportant parts of conversations.

      <title>Easy Come, Easy Go? Examining the Perceptions and Learning Effects of LLM-based Chatbot in the Context of Search-as-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cognitive process of Search-as-Learning (SAL) is most effective when searching promotes active encoding of information. The rise of LLMs-based chatbots, which provide instant answers, introduces a trade-off between efficiency and depth of processing. Such answer-centric approaches accelerate information access, but they also raise concerns about shallower learning. To examine these issues in the context of SAL, we conducted a large-scale survey of educators and students to capture perceived risks and benefits of LLM-based chatbots. In addition, we adopted the encoding-storage paradigm to design a within-subjects experiment, where participants (N=92) engaged in SAL tasks using three different modalities: books, search engines, and chatbots. Our findings provide a counterintuitive insight into stakeholder concerns: while LLM-based chatbots and search engines validated perceived benefits on learning efficiency by outperforming book-based search in immediate conceptual understanding, they did not result in a long-term inferiority as feared. Our study provides insights for designing human-AI collaborative learning systems that promote cognitive engagement by balancing learning efficiency and long-term knowledge retention.</description>

      <title>From Logits to Hierarchies: Hierarchical Clustering made Simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hierarchical structure inherent in many real-world datasets makes the modeling of such hierarchies a crucial objective in both unsupervised and supervised machine learning. While recent advancements have introduced deep architectures specifically designed for hierarchical clustering, we adopt a critical perspective on this line of research. Our findings reveal that these methods face significant limitations in scalability and performance when applied to realistic datasets. Given these findings, we present an alternative approach and introduce a lightweight method that builds on pre-trained non-hierarchical clustering models. Remarkably, our approach outperforms specialized deep models for hierarchical clustering, and it is broadly applicable to any pre-trained clustering model that outputs logits, without requiring any fine-tuning. To highlight the generality of our approach, we extend its application to a supervised setting, demonstrating its ability to recover meaningful hierarchies from a pre-trained ImageNet classifier. Our results establish a practical and effective alternative to existing deep hierarchical clustering methods, with significant advantages in efficiency, scalability and performance.</description>

      <title>Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08435v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.

      <title>Multi-Modality Collaborative Learning for Sentiment Analysis</title>

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) identifies individuals' sentiment states in videos by integrating visual, audio, and text modalities. Despite progress in existing methods, the inherent modality heterogeneity limits the effective capture of interactive sentiment features across modalities. In this paper, by introducing a Multi-Modality Collaborative Learning (MMCL) framework, we facilitate cross-modal interactions and capture enhanced and complementary features from modality-common and modality-specific representations, respectively. Specifically, we design a parameter-free decoupling module and separate uni-modality into modality-common and modality-specific components through semantics assessment of cross-modal elements. For modality-specific representations, inspired by the act-reward mechanism in reinforcement learning, we design policy models to adaptively mine complementary sentiment features under the guidance of a joint reward. For modality-common representations, intra-modal attention is employed to highlight crucial components, playing enhanced roles among modalities. Experimental results, including superiority evaluations on four databases, effectiveness verification of each module, and assessment of complementary features, demonstrate that MMCL successfully learns collaborative features across modalities and significantly improves performance.

      <title>Provable Ordering and Continuity in Vision-Language Pretraining for Generalizable Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-training vision-language representations on human action videos has emerged as a promising approach to reduce reliance on large-scale expert demonstrations for training embodied agents. However, prior methods often employ time contrastive learning based on goal-reaching heuristics, progressively aligning language instructions from the initial to the final frame. This overemphasis on future frames can result in erroneous vision-language associations, as actions may terminate early or include irrelevant moments in the end. To address this issue, we propose Action Temporal Coherence Learning (AcTOL) to learn ordered and continuous vision-language representations without rigid goal-based constraint. AcTOL treats a video as a continuous trajectory where it (1) contrasts semantic differences between frames to reflect their natural ordering, and (2) imposes a local Brownian bridge constraint to ensure smooth transitions across intermediate frames. Extensive imitation learning experiments on both simulated and real robots show that the pretrained features significantly enhance downstream manipulation tasks with high robustness to different linguistic styles of instructions, offering a viable pathway toward generalized embodied agents.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Discrete Diffusion Models with Policy Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to process complex discrete structures for language modeling. However, fine-tuning these models with policy gradient methods, as is commonly done in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), remains a challenging task. We propose an efficient, broadly applicable, and theoretically justified policy gradient algorithm, called Score Entropy Policy Optimization (\SEPO), for fine-tuning discrete diffusion models over non-differentiable rewards. Our numerical experiments across several discrete generative tasks demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ozekri/SEPO.</description>

      <title>Efficient Zero-Order Federated Finetuning of Language Models for Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated fine-tuning offers a promising approach for tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, fine-tuning these models on edge devices remains challenging due to high memory, communication, and computational demands. Zero-order optimization with task alignment provides a potential solution, enabling fine-tuning with inference-level memory requirements but requires a longer convergence time. In this paper, we propose \ac{METHOD} that divides the network into two blocks, applying a different number of perturbations per block in a computationally effective way, achieving faster convergence. Our evaluation shows a $1.6-3\times$ reduction in computation overhead compared to zero-order state of the art techniques in federated learning.</description>

      <title>Speech-FT: Merging Pre-trained And Fine-Tuned Speech Representation Models For Cross-Task Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning speech representation models can enhance performance on specific tasks but often compromises their cross-task generalization ability. This degradation is often caused by excessive changes in the representations, making it difficult to retain information learned during pre-training. Existing approaches, such as regularizing weight changes during fine-tuning, may fail to maintain sufficiently high feature similarity with the pre-trained model, and thus could possibly lose cross-task generalization. To address this issue, we propose Speech-FT, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework designed to maintain cross-task generalization while benefiting from fine-tuning. Speech-FT first applies fine-tuning specifically designed to reduce representational drift, followed by weight-space interpolation with the pre-trained model to restore cross-task generalization. Extensive experiments on HuBERT, wav2vec 2.0, DeCoAR 2.0, and WavLM Base+ demonstrate that Speech-FT consistently improves performance across a wide range of supervised, unsupervised, and multitask fine-tuning scenarios. Moreover, Speech-FT achieves superior cross-task generalization compared to fine-tuning baselines that explicitly constrain weight changes, such as weight-space regularization and LoRA fine-tuning. Our analysis reveals that Speech-FT maintains higher feature similarity to the pre-trained model compared to alternative strategies, despite allowing larger weight-space updates. Notably, Speech-FT achieves significant improvements on the SUPERB benchmark. For example, when fine-tuning HuBERT on automatic speech recognition, Speech-FT is able to reduce phone error rate from 5.17% to 3.94%, lower word error rate from 6.38% to 5.75%, and increase speaker identification accuracy from 81.86% to 84.11%. Speech-FT provides a simple yet powerful solution for further refining speech representation models after pre-training.</description>

      <title>Preference-Guided Diffusion for Multi-Objective Offline Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline multi-objective optimization aims to identify Pareto-optimal solutions given a dataset of designs and their objective values. In this work, we propose a preference-guided diffusion model that generates Pareto-optimal designs by leveraging a classifier-based guidance mechanism. Our guidance classifier is a preference model trained to predict the probability that one design dominates another, directing the diffusion model toward optimal regions of the design space. Crucially, this preference model generalizes beyond the training distribution, enabling the discovery of Pareto-optimal solutions outside the observed dataset. We introduce a novel diversity-aware preference guidance, augmenting Pareto dominance preference with diversity criteria. This ensures that generated solutions are optimal and well-distributed across the objective space, a capability absent in prior generative methods for offline multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our approach on various continuous offline multi-objective optimization tasks and find that it consistently outperforms other inverse/generative approaches while remaining competitive with forward/ surrogate-based optimization methods. Our results highlight the effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion models in generating diverse and high-quality solutions that approximate the Pareto front well.</description>

      <title>FinAudio: A Benchmark for Audio Large Language Models in Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have received widespread attention and have significantly improved performance on audio tasks such as conversation, audio understanding, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Despite these advancements, there is an absence of a benchmark for assessing AudioLLMs in financial scenarios, where audio data, such as earnings conference calls and CEO speeches, are crucial resources for financial analysis and investment decisions. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{FinAudio}, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capacity of AudioLLMs in the financial domain. We first define three tasks based on the unique characteristics of the financial domain: 1) ASR for short financial audio, 2) ASR for long financial audio, and 3) summarization of long financial audio. Then, we curate two short and two long audio datasets, respectively, and develop a novel dataset for financial audio summarization, comprising the \textsc{FinAudio} benchmark. Then, we evaluate seven prevalent AudioLLMs on \textsc{FinAudio}. Our evaluation reveals the limitations of existing AudioLLMs in the financial domain and offers insights for improving AudioLLMs. All datasets and codes will be released.</description>

      <title>HPU: High-Bandwidth Processing Unit for Scalable, Cost-effective LLM Inference via GPU Co-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The attention layer, a core component of Transformer-based LLMs, brings out inefficiencies in current GPU systems due to its low operational intensity and the substantial memory requirements of KV caches. We propose a High-bandwidth Processing Unit (HPU), a memoryintensive co-processor that enhances GPU resource utilization during large-batched LLM inference. By offloading memory-bound operations, the HPU allows the GPU to focus on compute-intensive tasks, increasing overall efficiency. Also, the HPU, as an add-on card, scales out to accommodate surging memory demands driven by large batch sizes and extended sequence lengths. In this paper, we show the HPU prototype implemented with PCIe-based FPGA cards mounted on a GPU system. Our novel GPU-HPU heterogeneous system demonstrates up to 4.1x performance gains and 4.6x energy efficiency improvements over a GPUonly system, providing scalability without increasing the number of GPUs.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Driven Agentic Scientific Corpus Distillation Framework for Biomedical Large Language Models Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Corpus distillation for biomedical large language models (LLMs) seeks to address the pressing challenge of insufficient quantity and quality in open-source annotated scientific corpora, which remains a bottleneck for effective LLM training in biomedical research. This paper proposes a knowledge-driven, agentic framework for scientific corpus distillation, tailored explicitly for LLM training in the biomedical domain, addressing the challenge posed by the complex hierarchy of biomedical knowledge. Central to our approach is a collaborative multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents, each guided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy, work in concert to autonomously extract, synthesize, and self-evaluate high-quality textual data from vast scientific literature. This agentic framework collectively generates and refines domain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and consistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement. Extensive experimental results show that language models trained on our multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines and advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables Llama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger scale. Detailed ablation studies and case analyses further validate the effectiveness and synergy of each agent within the framework, highlighting the potential of multi-agent collaboration in biomedical LLM training.</description>

      <title>A Token is Worth over 1,000 Tokens: Efficient Knowledge Distillation through Low-Rank Clone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training high-performing Small Language Models (SLMs) remains costly, even with knowledge distillation and pruning from larger teacher models. Existing work often faces three key challenges: (1) information loss from hard pruning, (2) inefficient alignment of representations, and (3) underutilization of informative activations, particularly from Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). To address these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient pre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence with strong teacher models. LRC trains a set of low-rank projection matrices that jointly enable soft pruning by compressing teacher weights, and activation clone by aligning student activations, including FFN signals, with those of the teacher. This unified design maximizes knowledge transfer while removing the need for explicit alignment modules. Extensive experiments with open-source teachers (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct) show that LRC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models trained on trillions of tokens--while using only 20B tokens, achieving over 1,000x training efficiency. Our codes and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/CURRENTF/LowRankClone and https://huggingface.co/collections/JitaiHao/low-rank-clone-lrc-6828389e96a93f1d4219dfaf.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Performance Ceiling in Reinforcement Learning requires Inference Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference. Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies for complex RL to date. Our experimental data and code are available at https://sites.google.com/view/inference-strategies-rl.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models in Crisis Detection: A Real-World Benchmark from Psychological Support Hotlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Psychological support hotlines serve as critical lifelines for crisis intervention but encounter significant challenges due to rising demand and limited resources. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential support in crisis assessments, yet their effectiveness in emotionally sensitive, real-world clinical settings remains underexplored. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a comprehensive benchmark of 540 annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline, assessing four key tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection, suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. 64 LLMs across 15 model families (including closed-source such as GPT, Claude, Gemini and open-source such as Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) were evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. LLMs showed strong results in suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779), and risk assessment (F1=0.907), with notable gains from few-shot prompting and fine-tuning. Compared to trained human operators, LLMs achieved comparable or superior performance on suicide plan identification and risk assessment, while humans retained advantages on mood status recognition and suicidal ideation detection. Mood status recognition remained challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to missing vocal cues and semantic ambiguity. Notably, a fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) outperformed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation tasks. LLMs demonstrate performance broadly comparable to trained human operators in text-based crisis assessment, with complementary strengths across task types. PsyCrisisBench provides a robust, real-world evaluation framework to guide future model development and ethical deployment in clinical mental health.</description>

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), particularly at the mild cognitive impairment stage, is essential for timely intervention. However, this process faces significant barriers, including reliance on subjective assessments and the high cost of advanced imaging techniques. While deep learning offers automated solutions to improve diagnostic accuracy, its widespread adoption remains constrained due to high energy requirements and computational demands, particularly in resource-limited settings. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide a promising alternative, as their brain-inspired design is well-suited to model the sparse and event-driven patterns characteristic of neural degeneration in AD. These networks offer the potential for developing interpretable, energy-efficient diagnostic tools. Despite their advantages, existing SNNs often suffer from limited expressiveness and challenges in stable training, which reduce their effectiveness in handling complex medical tasks. To address these shortcomings, we introduce FasterSNN, a hybrid neural architecture that combines biologically inspired Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention mechanisms. This approach facilitates efficient, sparse processing of 3D MRI data while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets reveal that FasterSNN delivers competitive performance with significantly enhanced efficiency and training stability, highlighting its potential for practical application in AD screening.

      <title>Scene-aware SAR ship detection guided by unsupervised sea-land segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DL based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection has tremendous advantages in numerous areas. However, it still faces some problems, such as the lack of prior knowledge, which seriously affects detection accuracy. In order to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method based on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical two-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and sea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module (LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on land according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add prior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby reducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore detection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection and enhances the interpretability of the model. Specifically, in consideration of the lack of land sea segmentation labels in existing deep learning-based SAR ship detection datasets, ULSM uses an unsupervised approach to classify the input data scene into inshore and offshore types and performs sea-land segmentation for inshore scenes. LASM uses the sea-land segmentation information as prior knowledge to reduce the network's attention to land. We conducted our experiments using the publicly available SSDD dataset, which demonstrated the effectiveness of our network.</description>

      <title>Echoes of AI: Investigating the Downstream Effects of AI Assistants on Software Maintainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: [Context] AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are transforming software engineering. While several studies highlight productivity improvements, their impact on maintainability requires further investigation. [Objective] This study investigates whether co-development with AI assistants affects software maintainability, specifically how easily other developers can evolve the resulting source code. [Method] We conducted a two-phase controlled experiment involving 151 participants, 95% of whom were professional developers. In Phase 1, participants added a new feature to a Java web application, with or without AI assistance. In Phase 2, a randomized controlled trial, new participants evolved these solutions without AI assistance. [Results] Phase 2 revealed no significant differences in subsequent evolution with respect to completion time or code quality. Bayesian analysis suggests that any speed or quality improvements from AI use were at most small and highly uncertain. Observational results from Phase 1 corroborate prior research: using an AI assistant yielded a 30.7% median reduction in completion time, and habitual AI users showed an estimated 55.9% speedup. [Conclusions] Overall, we did not detect systematic maintainability advantages or disadvantages when other developers evolved code co-developed with AI assistants. Within the scope of our tasks and measures, we observed no consistent warning signs of degraded code-level maintainability. Future work should examine risks such as code bloat from excessive code generation and cognitive debt as developers offload more mental effort to assistants.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Deep Learning Framework for Brain Stroke Diagnosis Using Computed Tomography Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain stroke is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, underscoring the need for precise and rapid prediction techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. Most stroke classification techniques use a single slice-level prediction mechanism, requiring radiologists to manually select the most critical CT slice from the original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques, this study investigates machine learning models for early brain stroke prediction using CT scan images. This research proposes a novel machine learning approach to brain stroke detection, focusing on optimizing classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are used for feature extraction. Feature engineering techniques, including BFO, PCA, and LDA, further enhance model performance. These features are then classified using machine learning algorithms, including SVC, RF, XGB, DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of 97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Improving Action Smoothness for a Cascaded Online Learning Flight Control System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to improve the action smoothness of a cascaded online learning flight control system. Although the cascaded structure is widely used in flight control design, its stability can be compromised by oscillatory control actions, which poses challenges for practical engineering applications. To address this issue, we introduce an online temporal smoothness technique and a low-pass filter to reduce the amplitude and frequency of the control actions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze policy performance in the frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate the improvements achieved by the two proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Beyond Rate Coding: Surrogate Gradients Enable Spike Timing Learning in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surrogate gradient descent algorithm enabled spiking neural networks to be trained to carry out challenging sensory processing tasks, an important step in understanding how spikes contribute to neural computations. However, it is unclear the extent to which these algorithms fully explore the space of possible spiking solutions to problems. We investigated whether spiking networks trained with surrogate gradient descent can learn to make use of information that is only encoded in the timing and not the rate of spikes. We constructed synthetic datasets with a range of types of spike timing information (interspike intervals, spatio-temporal spike patterns or polychrony, and coincidence codes). We find that surrogate gradient descent training can extract all of these types of information. In more realistic speech-based datasets, both timing and rate information is present. We therefore constructed variants of these datasets in which all rate information is removed, and find that surrogate gradient descent can still perform well. We tested all networks both with and without trainable axonal delays. We find that delays can give a significant increase in performance, particularly for more challenging tasks. To determine what types of spike timing information are being used by the networks trained on the speech-based tasks, we test these networks on time-reversed spikes which perturb spatio-temporal spike patterns but leave interspike intervals and coincidence information unchanged. We find that when axonal delays are not used, networks perform well under time reversal, whereas networks trained with delays perform poorly. This suggests that spiking neural networks with delays are better able to exploit temporal structure. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified speech-based datasets.</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding as a Reconfiguration of Intent Mediation in Software Development: Definition, Implications, and Research Agenda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now being generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and Generative AI (GenAI) engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding redistributes epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting expertise from technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks such as black-box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-, technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future investigations of this paradigm.</description>

      <title>RL from Teacher-Model Refinement: Gradual Imitation Learning for Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance, promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher, mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement. On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy) and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.</description>

      <title>Constitutional Law and AI Governance: Constraints on Model Licensing and Research Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformative AI systems may pose unprecedented catastrophic risks, but the U.S. Constitution places significant constraints on the government's ability to govern this technology. This paper examines how the First Amendment, administrative law, and the Fourteenth Amendment shape the legal vulnerability of two regulatory proposals: model licensing and AI research classification. While the First Amendment may provide some degree of protection for model algorithms or outputs, this protection does not foreclose regulation. Policymakers must also consider administrative legal requirements, due to both agency review and authority. Finally, while substantive due process and equal protection pose minimal obstacles, procedural due process requires the government to clearly define when developers vest a legal interest in their models. Given this analysis, effective AI governance requires careful implementation to avoid these legal challenges.</description>

      <title>Long-Horizon Visual Imitation Learning via Plan and Code Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence, which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Alzheimer's Disease Progression via SDE-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Deep Learning on Longitudinal Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity (600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation, CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal reasoning.</description>

      <title>TACOS: Task Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the task may demand varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans interacting with the real world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot coordination. We demonstrate the system on a real-world multi-drone system, and conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.</description>

      <title>BigCodeArena: Unveiling More Reliable Human Preferences in Code Generation via Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation performance among recent emerging models.</description>

      <title>Reverse Supervision at Scale: Exponential Search Meets the Economics of Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster -- computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view, generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing. Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.</description>

      <title>DriveVLA-W0: World Models Amplify Data Scaling Law in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</description>

      <title>LLM one-shot style transfer for Authorship Attribution and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational stylometry studies writing style through quantitative textual patterns, enabling applications such as authorship attribution, identity linking, and plagiarism detection. Existing supervised and contrastive approaches often rely on datasets with spurious correlations, conflating style with topic. Despite the relevance of language modeling to these tasks, the pre-training of modern large language models (LLMs) has been underutilized in general authorship analysis. We introduce an unsupervised framework that uses the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability between two texts. This framework takes advantage of the extensive CLM pre-training and in-context capabilities of modern LLMs. Our approach avoids explicit supervision with spuriously correlated data. Our method substantially outperforms unsupervised prompting-based baselines at similar model sizes and exceeds contrastively trained models when controlling for topical overlap. Our framework's performance improves with model size. In the case of authorship verification, we present an additional mechanism that increases test-time computation to improve accuracy; enabling flexible trade-offs between computational cost and task performance.</description>

      <title>Alternative Fairness and Accuracy Optimization in Criminal Justice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04505v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual, and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related tools.</description>

      <title>Voice-Interactive Surgical Agent for Multimodal Patient Data Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In robotic surgery, surgeons fully engage their hands and visual attention in procedures, making it difficult to access and manipulate multimodal patient data without interrupting the workflow. To overcome this problem, we propose a Voice-Interactive Surgical Agent (VISA) built on a hierarchical multi-agent framework consisting of an orchestration agent and three task-specific agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). These LLM-based agents autonomously plan, refine, validate, and reason to interpret voice commands and execute tasks such as retrieving clinical information, manipulating CT scans, or navigating 3D anatomical models within surgical video. We construct a dataset of 240 user commands organized into hierarchical categories and introduce the Multi-level Orchestration Evaluation Metric (MOEM) that evaluates the performance and robustness at both the command and category levels. Experimental results demonstrate that VISA achieves high stage-level accuracy and workflow-level success rates, while also enhancing its robustness by correcting transcription errors, resolving linguistic ambiguity, and interpreting diverse free-form expressions. These findings highlight the strong potential of VISA to support robotic surgery and its scalability for integrating new functions and agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main drawback of using generative AI models for advanced mathematics is that these models are not primarily logical reasoning engines. However, Large Language Models, and their refinements, can pick up on patterns in higher mathematics that are difficult for humans to see. By putting the design of generative AI models to their advantage, mathematicians may use them as powerful interactive assistants that can carry out laborious tasks, generate and debug code, check examples, formulate conjectures and more. We discuss how generative AI models can be used to advance mathematics research. We also discuss their integration with neuro-symbolic solvers, Computer Algebra Systems and formal proof assistants such as Lean.</description>

      <title>Biologically-Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attacks on Generative Genomic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increased availability of genetic data has transformed genomics research, but raised many privacy concerns regarding its handling due to its sensitive nature. This work explores the use of language models (LMs) for the generation of synthetic genetic mutation profiles, leveraging differential privacy (DP) for the protection of sensitive genetic data. We empirically evaluate the privacy guarantees of our DP modes by introducing a novel Biologically-Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attack (biHMIA), which combines traditional black box MIA with contextual genomics metrics for enhanced attack power. Our experiments show that both small and large transformer GPT-like models are viable synthetic variant generators for small-scale genomics, and that our hybrid attack leads, on average, to higher adversarial success compared to traditional metric-based MIAs.</description>

      <title>EnviSAgE: A Survey of Environment Scaling for Qualitative Agentic Experience Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based agents can autonomously accomplish complex tasks across various domains. However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze implementation frameworks, challenges, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) contains dietary information remains unknown. We trained a language model on 1.1M meals to predict meal descriptions from PPG, aligning PPG to text. PPG nontrivially predicts meal content; predictability decreases for PPGs farther from meals. This transfers to dietary tasks: PPG increases AUC by 11% for intake and satiety across held-out and independent cohorts, with gains robust to text degradation. Wearable PPG may enable passive dietary monitoring.</description>

      <title>First, do NOHARM: towards clinically safe large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely used by physicians and patients for medical advice, yet their clinical safety profiles remain poorly characterized. We present NOHARM (Numerous Options Harm Assessment for Risk in Medicine), a benchmark using 100 real primary care-to-specialist consultation cases to measure frequency and severity of harm from LLM-generated medical recommendations. NOHARM covers 10 specialties, with 12,747 expert annotations for 4,249 clinical management options. Across 31 LLMs, potential for severe harm from LLM recommendations occurs in up to 22.2% (95% CI 21.6-22.8%) of cases, with harm of omission accounting for 76.6% (95% CI 76.4-76.8%) of errors. Safety performance is only moderately correlated (r = 0.61-0.64) with existing AI and medical knowledge benchmarks. The best models outperform generalist physicians on safety (mean difference 9.7%, 95% CI 7.0-12.5%), and a diverse multi-agent approach improves safety compared to solo models (mean difference 8.0%, 95% CI 4.0-12.1%). Therefore, despite strong performance on existing evaluations, widely used AI models can produce severely harmful medical advice at nontrivial rates, underscoring clinical safety as a distinct performance dimension necessitating explicit measurement.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{D}^\mathrm{3}$-Predictor: Noise-Free Deterministic Diffusion for Dense Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although diffusion models with strong visual priors have emerged as powerful dense prediction backboens, they overlook a core limitation: the stochastic noise at the core of diffusion sampling is inherently misaligned with dense prediction that requires a deterministic mapping from image to geometry. In this paper, we show that this stochastic noise corrupts fine-grained spatial cues and pushes the model toward timestep-specific noise objectives, consequently destroying meaningful geometric structure mappings. To address this, we introduce $\mathrm{D}^\mathrm{3}$-Predictor, a noise-free deterministic framework built by reformulating a pretrained diffusion model without stochasticity noise. Instead of relying on noisy inputs to leverage diffusion priors, $\mathrm{D}^\mathrm{3}$-Predictor views the pretrained diffusion network as an ensemble of timestep-dependent visual experts and self-supervisedly aggregates their heterogeneous priors into a single, clean, and complete geometric prior. Meanwhile, we utilize task-specific supervision to seamlessly adapt this noise-free prior to dense prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on various dense prediction tasks demonstrate that $\mathrm{D}^\mathrm{3}$-Predictor achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios. In addition, it requires less than half the training data previously used and efficiently performs inference in a single step. Our code, data, and checkpoints are publicly available at https://x-gengroup.github.io/HomePage_D3-Predictor/.</description>

      <title>Robust Finetuning of Vision-Language-Action Robot Policies via Parameter Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalist robot policies, trained on large and diverse datasets, have demonstrated the ability to generalize across a wide spectrum of behaviors, enabling a single policy to act in varied real-world environments. However, they still fall short on new tasks not covered in the training data. When finetuned on limited demonstrations of a new task, these policies often overfit to the specific demonstrations--not only losing their prior abilities to solve a wide variety of generalist tasks but also failing to generalize within the new task itself. In this work, we aim to develop a method that preserves the generalization capabilities of the generalist policy during finetuning, allowing a single policy to robustly incorporate a new skill into its repertoire. Our goal is a single policy that both learns to generalize to variations of the new task and retains the broad competencies gained from pretraining. We show that this can be achieved through a simple yet effective strategy: interpolating the weights of a finetuned model with that of the pretrained model. We show, across extensive simulated and real-world experiments, that such model merging produces a single model that inherits the generalist abilities of the base model and learns to solve the new task robustly, outperforming both the pretrained and finetuned model on out-of-distribution variations of the new task. Moreover, we show that model merging performance scales with the amount of pretraining data, and enables continual acquisition of new skills in a lifelong learning setting, without sacrificing previously learned generalist abilities.</description>

      <title>Developing Distance-Aware, and Evident Uncertainty Quantification in Dynamic Physics-Constrained Neural Networks for Robust Bearing Degradation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and uncertainty-aware degradation estimation is essential for predictive maintenance in safety-critical systems like rotating machinery with rolling-element bearings. Many existing uncertainty methods lack confidence calibration, are costly to run, are not distance-aware, and fail to generalize under out-of-distribution data. We introduce two distance-aware uncertainty methods for deterministic physics-guided neural networks: PG-SNGP, based on Spectral Normalization Gaussian Process, and PG-SNER, based on Deep Evidential Regression. We apply spectral normalization to the hidden layers so the network preserves distances from input to latent space. PG-SNGP replaces the final dense layer with a Gaussian Process layer for distance-sensitive uncertainty, while PG-SNER outputs Normal Inverse Gamma parameters to model uncertainty in a coherent probabilistic form. We assess performance using standard accuracy metrics and a new distance-aware metric based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which measures how well predicted uncertainty tracks the distance between test and training samples. We also design a dynamic weighting scheme in the loss to balance data fidelity and physical consistency. We test our methods on rolling-element bearing degradation using the PRONOSTIA, XJTU-SY and HUST datasets and compare them with Monte Carlo and Deep Ensemble PGNNs. Results show that PG-SNGP and PG-SNER improve prediction accuracy, generalize reliably under OOD conditions, and remain robust to adversarial attacks and noise.</description>

      <title>Digital Modeling of Spatial Pathway Activity from Histology Reveals Tumor Microenvironment Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables simultaneous mapping of tissue morphology and spatially resolved gene expression, offering unique opportunities to study tumor microenvironment heterogeneity. Here, we introduce a computational framework that predicts spatial pathway activity directly from hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained histology images at microscale resolution 55 and 100 um. Using image features derived from a computational pathology foundation model, we found that TGFb signaling was the most accurately predicted pathway across three independent breast and lung cancer ST datasets. In 87-88% of reliably predicted cases, the resulting spatial TGFb activity maps reflected the expected contrast between tumor and adjacent non-tumor regions, consistent with the known role of TGFb in regulating interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, linear and nonlinear predictive models performed similarly, suggesting that image features may relate to pathway activity in a predominantly linear fashion or that nonlinear structure is small relative to measurement noise. These findings demonstrate that features extracted from routine histopathology may recover spatially coherent and biologically interpretable pathway patterns, offering a scalable strategy for integrating image-based inference with ST information in tumor microenvironment studies.</description>

      <title>MindShift: Analyzing Language Models' Reactions to Psychological Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to absorb and reflect personality traits and attitudes specified by users. In our study, we investigated this potential using robust psychometric measures. We adapted the most studied test in psychological literature, namely Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and examined LLMs' behavior to identify traits. To asses the sensitivity of LLMs' prompts and psychological biases we created personality-oriented prompts, crafting a detailed set of personas that vary in trait intensity. This enables us to measure how well LLMs follow these roles. Our study introduces MindShift, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' psychological adaptability. The results highlight a consistent improvement in LLMs' role perception, attributed to advancements in training datasets and alignment techniques. Additionally, we observe significant differences in responses to psychometric assessments across different model types and families, suggesting variability in their ability to emulate human-like personality traits. MindShift prompts and code for LLM evaluation will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>AI Autonomy Coefficient ($\alpha$): Defining Boundaries for Responsible AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integrity of many contemporary AI systems is compromised by the misuse of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) models to obscure systems that remain heavily dependent on human labor. We define this structural dependency as Human-Instead-of-AI (HISOAI), an ethically problematic and economically unsustainable design in which human workers function as concealed operational substitutes rather than intentional, high-value collaborators. To address this issue, we introduce the AI-First, Human-Empowered (AFHE) paradigm, which requires AI systems to demonstrate a quantifiable level of functional independence prior to deployment. This requirement is formalized through the AI Autonomy Coefficient, measuring the proportion of tasks completed without mandatory human intervention. We further propose the AFHE Deployment Algorithm, an algorithmic gate that enforces a minimum autonomy threshold during offline evaluation and shadow deployment. Our results show that the AI Autonomy Coefficient effectively identifies HISOAI systems with an autonomy level of 0.38, while systems governed by the AFHE framework achieve an autonomy level of 0.85. We conclude that AFHE provides a metric-driven approach for ensuring verifiable autonomy, transparency, and sustainable operational integrity in modern AI systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Edge-Cloud Inference for Speech-to-Action Systems Using ASR and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voice-based interaction has emerged as a natural and intuitive modality for controlling IoT devices. However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependence, and privacy concerns, and edge-based solutions, which provide low latency and improved privacy but are limited by computational constraints. This paper presents ASTA, an adaptive speech-to-action solution that dynamically routes voice commands between edge and cloud inference to balance performance and system resource utilization. ASTA integrates on-device automatic speech recognition and lightweight offline language-model inference with cloud-based LLM processing, guided by real-time system metrics such as CPU workload, device temperature, and network latency. A metric-aware routing mechanism selects the inference path at runtime, while a rule-based command validation and repair component ensures successful end-to-end command execution. We implemented our solution on an NVIDIA Jetson-based edge platform and evaluated it using a diverse dataset of 80 spoken commands. Experimental results show that ASTA successfully routes all input commands for execution, achieving a balanced distribution between online and offline inference. The system attains an ASR accuracy of 62.5% and generates executable commands without repair for only 47.5% of inputs, highlighting the importance of the repair mechanism in improving robustness. These results suggest that adaptive edge-cloud orchestration is a viable approach for resilient and resource-aware voice-controlled IoT systems.</description>

      <title>UniVCD: A New Method for Unsupervised Change Detection in the Open-Vocabulary Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Change detection (CD) identifies scene changes from multi-temporal observations and is widely used in urban development and environmental monitoring. Most existing CD methods rely on supervised learning, making performance strongly dataset-dependent and incurring high annotation costs; they typically focus on a few predefined categories and generalize poorly to diverse scenes. With the rise of vision foundation models such as SAM2 and CLIP, new opportunities have emerged to relax these constraints. We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU. The results demonstrate that unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary CD. Code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/Die-Xie/UniVCD.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Restoration for Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection in Adverse Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal 3D object detection is important for reliable perception in robotics and autonomous driving. However, its effectiveness remains limited under adverse weather conditions due to weather-induced distortions and misalignment between different data modalities. In this work, we propose DiffFusion, a novel framework designed to enhance robustness in challenging weather through diffusion-based restoration and adaptive cross-modal fusion. Our key insight is that diffusion models possess strong capabilities for denoising and generating data that can adapt to various weather conditions. Building on this, DiffFusion introduces Diffusion-IR restoring images degraded by weather effects and Point Cloud Restoration (PCR) compensating for corrupted LiDAR data using image object cues. To tackle misalignments between two modalities, we develop Bidirectional Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Module (BAFAM). It enables dynamic multi-modal fusion and bidirectional bird's-eye view (BEV) alignment to maintain consistent spatial correspondence. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that DiffFusion achieves state-of-the-art robustness under adverse weather while preserving strong clean-data performance. Zero-shot results on the real-world DENSE dataset further validate its generalization. The implementation of our DiffFusion will be released as open-source.</description>

      <title>Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR): A Computational Framework for Contextual Identity and Ambiguity Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems, despite remarkable capabilities in text generation and pattern recognition, exhibit a fundamental architectural limitation: they resolve ambiguity prematurely. This premature semantic collapse -- the tendency to collapse multiple valid interpretations into a single output -- stems from classical identity assumptions embedded in standard neural architectures. We propose Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a computational framework that treats ambiguity retention as a valid reasoning mode rather than a defect to be eliminated. NRR introduces three core principles: (1) Non-Identity ($A \neq A$) -- the same symbol refers to different entities across contexts; (2) Approximate Identity ($A \approx A$) -- entities share partial structural overlap without being identical; and (3) Non-Resolution -- conflicting interpretations can coexist without forced convergence. We formalize these principles through three architectural components: Multi-Vector Embeddings for context-dependent representation, Non-Collapsing Attention for parallel interpretation retention, and Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT) for maintaining $A \neq A$ across inference. We demonstrate NRR's advantages through case studies in paradox handling, creative generation, and context-dependent reasoning. Crucially, we provide a minimal empirical validation on a synthetic context-shift task where an NRR-lite model achieves 90.9% out-of-distribution accuracy compared to 9.1% for standard architectures, demonstrating that ambiguity preservation enables structural generalization. NRR challenges the assumption that meaning must collapse to be useful, offering a foundation for AI systems capable of sophisticated ambiguity handling and creative reasoning. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control.</description>

      <title>From Context to EDUs: Faithful and Structured Context Compression via Elementary Discourse Unit Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Managing extensive context remains a critical bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in applications like long-document question answering and autonomous agents where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.</description>

      <title>Spoken DialogSum: An Emotion-Rich Conversational Dataset for Spoken Dialogue Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. We release an online demo at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/, with plans to release the full dataset in the near future. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.</description>

      <title>SEED: Spectral Entropy-Guided Evaluation of SpatialTemporal Dependencies for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective multivariate time series forecasting often benefits from accurately modeling complex inter-variable dependencies. However, existing attention- or graph-based methods face three key issues: (a) strong temporal self-dependencies are often disrupted by irrelevant variables; (b) softmax normalization ignores and reverses negative correlations; (c) variables struggle to perceive their temporal positions. To address these, we propose \textbf{SEED}, a Spectral Entropy-guided Evaluation framework for spatial-temporal Dependency modeling. SEED introduces a Dependency Evaluator, a key innovation that leverages spectral entropy to dynamically provide a preliminary evaluation of the spatial and temporal dependencies of each variable, enabling the model to adaptively balance Channel Independence (CI) and Channel Dependence (CD) strategies. To account for temporal regularities originating from the influence of other variables rather than intrinsic dynamics, we propose Spectral Entropy-based Fuser to further refine the evaluated dependency weights, effectively separating this part. Moreover, to preserve negative correlations, we introduce a Signed Graph Constructor that enables signed edge weights, overcoming the limitations of softmax. Finally, to help variables perceive their temporal positions and thereby construct more comprehensive spatial features, we introduce the Context Spatial Extractor, which leverages local contextual windows to extract spatial features. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generality.</description>

      <title>Let the Barbarians In: How AI Can Accelerate Systems Performance Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform the research process by automating the discovery of new solutions. This shift depends on the availability of reliable verifiers, which AI-driven approaches require to validate candidate solutions. Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight.
  Note: This paper is an extension of our prior work [14]. It adds extensive evaluation across multiple ADRS frameworks and provides deeper analysis and insights into best practices.</description>

      <title>Meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised optic disc and cup segmentation on fundus images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study develops meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation (FWS) to address the challenge of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation for glaucoma diagnosis with limited labeled fundus images. We significantly improve existing meta-learners by introducing Omni meta-training which balances data usage and diversifies the number of shots. We also develop their efficient versions that reduce computational costs. In addition, we develop sparsification techniques that generate more customizable and representative scribbles and other sparse labels. After evaluating multiple datasets, we find that Omni and efficient versions outperform the original versions, with the best meta-learner being Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg). It achieves intersection over union (IoU) scores of 88.15% for OD and 71.17% for OC on the REFUGE dataset using just one sparsely labeled image, outperforming few-shot and semi-supervised methods which require more labeled images. Its best performance reaches 86.80% for OD and 71.78%for OC on DRISHTIGS, 88.21% for OD and 73.70% for OC on REFUGE, 80.39% for OD and 52.65% for OC on REFUGE. EO-ProtoSeg is comparable to unsupervised domain adaptation methods yet much lighter with less than two million parameters and does not require any retraining.</description>

      <title>"I am here for you": How relational conversational AI appeals to adolescents, especially those who are socially and emotionally vulnerable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General-purpose conversational AI chatbots and AI companions increasingly provide young adolescents with emotionally supportive conversations, raising questions about how conversational style shapes anthropomorphism and emotional reliance. In a preregistered online experiment with 284 adolescent-parent dyads, youth aged 11-15 and their parents read two matched transcripts in which a chatbot responded to an everyday social problem using either a relational style (first-person, affiliative, commitment language) or a transparent style (explicit nonhumanness, informational tone). Adolescents more often preferred the relational than the transparent style, whereas parents were more likely to prefer transparent style than adolescents. Adolescents rated the relational chatbot as more human-like, likable, trustworthy and emotionally close, while perceiving both styles as similarly helpful. Adolescents who preferred relational style had lower family and peer relationship quality and higher stress and anxiety than those preferring transparent style or both chatbots. These findings identify conversational style as a key design lever for youth AI safety, showing that relational framing heightens anthropomorphism, trust and emotional closeness and can be especially appealing to socially and emotionally vulnerable adolescents, who may be at increased risk for emotional reliance on conversational AI.</description>
