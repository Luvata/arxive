      <title>MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and analysis.</description>

      <title>Post-surgical Endometriosis Segmentation in Laparoscopic Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved video browsing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments. Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained. The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially in few-shot learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Finding Holes: Pathologist Level Performance Using AI for Cribriform Morphology Detection in Prostate Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance. However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430 patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261 slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions for prostate cancer patients.</description>

      <title>NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However, non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.</description>

      <title>Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs); however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs, which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips, resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Multiple Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts. However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently, generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared, compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/</description>

      <title>Capture, Canonicalize, Splat: Zero-Shot 3D Gaussian Avatars from Unstructured Phone Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic, identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This "Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured photos.</description>

      <title>cubic: CUDA-accelerated 3D Bioimage Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration, lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM. cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods, enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis workflows. cubic is openly available at https://github$.$com/alxndrkalinin/cubic</description>

      <title>Virtually Being: Customizing Camera-Controllable Video Diffusion Models with Multi-View Performance Captures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video generation into virtual production.

      <title>Joint Modeling of Big Five and HEXACO for Multimodal Apparent Personality-trait Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology, for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.</description>

      <title>LOTA: Bit-Planes Guided AI-Generated Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%} (\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.</description>

      <title>PIA: Deepfake Detection Using Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences, lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities.

      <title>Event Interval Modulation: A Novel Scheme for Event-based Optical Camera Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge, no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme, called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over 10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.</description>

      <title>MACE: Mixture-of-Experts Accelerated Coordinate Encoding for Large-Scale Scene Localization and Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes. Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks, ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference. Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.</description>

      <title>Identity-Preserving Image-to-Video Generation via Reward-Guided Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Identity-GRPO: Optimizing Multi-Human Identity-preserving Video Generation via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.</description>

      <title>MatchAttention: Matching the Relative Positions for High-Resolution Cross-View Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism, MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component. To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference. MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and high-accuracy cross-view matching possible.

      <title>GauSSmart: Enhanced 3D Reconstruction through 2D Foundation Models and Geometric Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision, with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges 2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes. Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches, highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either approach alone.</description>

      <title>CLEAR: Causal Learning Framework For Robust Histopathology Tumor Detection Under Out-Of-Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset, demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result, our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.</description>

      <title>Watermarking for Factuality: Guiding Vision-Language Models Toward Truth via Tri-layer Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1) select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2) identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE, MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded responses.</description>

      <title>A Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN for Iris Presentation Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs) where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this, we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN (MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Vision-Centric Activation and Coordination for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However, mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs, thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs. Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Cycle-Consistent Anchor Points for Self-Supervised RGB-D Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for geometric reasoning of scenes. While many RGB-D registration meth- ods rely on geometric and feature-based similarity, we take a different approach. We use cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet and 3DMatch, even outperforming some older supervised methods. We also integrate our components into existing methods, showing their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Spatial Preference Rewarding for MLLMs Spatial Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with minimal overhead in training.

      <title>DOS: Directional Object Separation in Text Embeddings for Multi-Object Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks. These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving multi-object image generation.</description>

      <title>DRBD-Mamba for Robust and Efficient Brain Tumor Segmentation with Analytical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions. Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance. However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the 20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of 0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor. Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>BoardVision: Deployment-ready and Robust Motherboard Defect Detection with YOLO+Faster-RCNN Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work, we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble, Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes, highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard manufacturing.</description>

      <title>DCMIL: A Progressive Representation Learning Model of Whole Slide Images for Cancer Prognosis Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles) demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models. Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/tuuuc/DCMIL.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Neural Video Compression with Unified Intra and Inter Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations, including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled, disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding, where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and models will be released.</description>

      <title>Structured Universal Adversarial Attacks on Object Detection for Video Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/jsve96/AO-Exp-Attack.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Deep Generative Models for Anomaly Detection in Neuroimaging: A Systematic Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging. Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49 studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual) reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce, as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning, supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within- and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling, development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and rigorous clinical validation.</description>

      <title>Pruning Overparameterized Multi-Task Networks for Degraded Web Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters, making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining, dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at https://github.com/Thomkat/MIR-L.</description>

      <title>Grazing Detection using Deep Learning and Sentinel-2 Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Vision Mamba for Permeability Prediction of Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically, a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time, a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of ViTs.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Surgical Instrument Defect Detection via Non-Destructive Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defective surgical instruments pose serious risks to sterility, mechanical integrity, and patient safety, increasing the likelihood of surgical complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects in real-time, ensuring high accuracy and industrial scalability. The model is trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images, covering 11 instrument types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image, making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection, addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable, cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards, paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Noise Projection: Closing the Prompt-Agnostic Gap Behind Text-to-Image Misalignment in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection. In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch: during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising. Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training, without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves text-image alignment across diverse prompts.</description>

      <title>PaddleOCR-VL: Boosting Multilingual Document Parsing via a 0.9B Ultra-Compact Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report, we propose PaddleOCR-VL, a SOTA and resource-efficient model tailored for document parsing. Its core component is PaddleOCR-VL-0.9B, a compact yet powerful vision-language model (VLM) that integrates a NaViT-style dynamic resolution visual encoder with the ERNIE-4.5-0.3B language model to enable accurate element recognition. This innovative model efficiently supports 109 languages and excels in recognizing complex elements (e.g., text, tables, formulas, and charts), while maintaining minimal resource consumption. Through comprehensive evaluations on widely used public benchmarks and in-house benchmarks, PaddleOCR-VL achieves SOTA performance in both page-level document parsing and element-level recognition. It significantly outperforms existing solutions, exhibits strong competitiveness against top-tier VLMs, and delivers fast inference speeds. These strengths make it highly suitable for practical deployment in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalist Intelligence in Dentistry: Vision Foundation Models for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design, and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM, the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry. DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases, imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation. Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable. DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address critical gaps in global oral healthcare.</description>

      <title>Acquisition of interpretable domain information during brain MR image harmonization for content-based image retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images $\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images. PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image $f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image $\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.</description>

      <title>Exploring Image Representation with Decoupled Classical Visual Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge, colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for visual understanding.

      <title>Exploring Cross-Modal Flows for Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on challenging datasets.</description>

      <title>Consistent text-to-image generation via scene de-contextualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes. This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity preservation while maintaining scene diversity.</description>

      <title>Eyes Wide Open: Ego Proactive Video-LLM for Streaming Video</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Envision an AI capable of functioning in human-like settings, moving beyond mere observation to actively understand, anticipate, and proactively respond to unfolding events. Towards this vision, we focus on the innovative task where, given ego-streaming video input, an assistant proactively answers diverse, evolving questions at the opportune moment, while maintaining synchronized perception and reasoning. This task embodies three key properties: (1) Proactive Coherence, (2) Just-in-Time Responsiveness, and (3) Synchronized Efficiency. To evaluate and address these properties, we first introduce ESTP-Bench (Ego Streaming Proactive Benchmark) alongside the ESTP-F1 metric-a novel framework designed for their rigorous assessment. Secondly, we propose a comprehensive technical pipeline to enable models to tackle this challenging task. This pipeline comprises: (1) a data engine, (2) a multi-stage training strategy, and (3) a proactive dynamic compression technique. Our proposed model effectively addresses these critical properties while outperforming multiple baselines across diverse online and offline benchmarks.

      <title>BalanceGS: Algorithm-System Co-design for Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting Training on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting. Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible quality degradation.</description>

      <title>CALM-Net: Curvature-Aware LiDAR Point Cloud-based Multi-Branch Neural Network for Vehicle Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle re-identification.</description>

      <title>Talking Points: Describing and Localizing Pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional nature of our framework should enable future applications in both keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/matanr/Talking_Points.</description>

      <title>STANCE: Motion Coherent Video Generation Via Sparse-to-Dense Anchored Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps) often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance; and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse, user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB \(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Re-Classification: Combining Animal Classification Models with Vision Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art animal classification models like SpeciesNet provide predictions across thousands of species but use conservative rollup strategies, resulting in many animals labeled at high taxonomic levels rather than species. We present a hierarchical re-classification system for the Animal Detect platform that combines SpeciesNet EfficientNetV2-M predictions with CLIP embeddings and metric learning to refine high-level taxonomic labels toward species-level identification. Our five-stage pipeline (high-confidence acceptance, bird override, centroid building, triplet-loss metric learning, and adaptive cosine-distance scoring) is evaluated on a segment of the LILA BC Desert Lion Conservation dataset (4,018 images, 15,031 detections). After recovering 761 bird detections from "blank" and "animal" labels, we re-classify 456 detections labeled animal, mammal, or blank with 96.5% accuracy, achieving species-level identification for 64.9 percent</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Wildlife Sorting Using Vision Transformers: Evaluating Clustering and Continuous Similarity Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera traps generate millions of wildlife images, yet many datasets contain species that are absent from existing classifiers. This work evaluates zero-shot approaches for organizing unlabeled wildlife imagery using self-supervised vision transformers, developed and tested within the Animal Detect platform for camera trap analysis. We compare unsupervised clustering methods (DBSCAN, GMM) across three architectures (CLIP, DINOv2, MegaDescriptor) combined with dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP), and we demonstrate continuous 1D similarity ordering via t-SNE projection. On a 5-species test set with ground truth labels used only for evaluation, DINOv2 with UMAP and GMM achieves 88.6 percent accuracy (macro-F1 = 0.874), while 1D sorting reaches 88.2 percent coherence for mammals and birds and 95.2 percent for fish across 1,500 images. Based on these findings, we deployed continuous similarity ordering in production, enabling rapid exploratory analysis and accelerating manual annotation workflows for biodiversity monitoring.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-based Visual Question Answer with Multimodal Processing, Retrieval and Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>Shot2Tactic-Caption: Multi-Scale Captioning of Badminton Videos for Tactical Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions. Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic captioning.</description>

      <title>Efficient Video Sampling: Pruning Temporally Redundant Tokens for Faster VLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling (EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity, requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.</description>

      <title>Adapting Self-Supervised Representations as a Latent Space for Efficient Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective. This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for efficient generative modeling.</description>

      <title>SteeringTTA: Guiding Diffusion Trajectories for Robust Test-Time-Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA, an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning with Unpaired Clips for Instruction-based Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality. Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation Speeds Up Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence. Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data, confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.</description>

      <title>EuroMineNet: A Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Benchmark for Spatiotemporal Mining Footprint Analysis in the European Union (2015-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations. Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.</description>

      <title>WeCKD: Weakly-supervised Chained Distillation Network for Efficient Multimodal Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain, where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which highlights its potential for real-world adoption.</description>

      <title>VTimeCoT: Thinking by Drawing for Video Temporal Grounding and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project page: https://vtimecot.github.io</description>

      <title>Leveraging Learned Image Prior for 3D Gaussian Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful representational capacity of learned image priors to recover compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.</description>

      <title>Where are the Whales: A Human-in-the-loop Detection Method for Identifying Whales in High-resolution Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of 90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to 99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open sourced this pipeline at https://github.com/microsoft/whales.</description>

      <title>Camera Movement Classification in Historical Footage: A Comparative Study of Deep Video Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera movement conveys spatial and narrative information essential for understanding video content. While recent camera movement classification (CMC) methods perform well on modern datasets, their generalization to historical footage remains unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of deep video CMC models on archival film material. We summarize representative methods and datasets, highlighting differences in model design and label definitions. Five standard video classification models are assessed on the HISTORIAN dataset, which includes expert-annotated World War II footage. The best-performing model, Video Swin Transformer, achieves 80.25% accuracy, showing strong convergence despite limited training data. Our findings highlight the challenges and potential of adapting existing models to low-quality video and motivate future work combining diverse input modalities and temporal architectures.</description>

      <title>Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module for Multi-Scale Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module (CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance, achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO (vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.</description>

      <title>Free-Grained Hierarchical Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy, but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic, mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These, along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical classification under real-world constraints.</description>

      <title>DEXTER: Diffusion-Guided EXplanations with TExtual Reasoning for Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

      <title>LightQANet: Quantized and Adaptive Feature Learning for Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative results across various challenging lighting scenarios.</description>

      <title>Inpainting the Red Planet: Diffusion Models for the Reconstruction of Martian Environments in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks, such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE) and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.</description>

      <title>MoCom: Motion-based Inter-MAV Visual Communication Using Event Vision and Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns, which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down), horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right, representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption, and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV communication in constrained environments.</description>

      <title>CoT-PL: Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Meets Pseudo-Labeling for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings, our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4% and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9 mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.</description>

      <title>Morphology-Aware Prognostic model for Five-Year Survival Prediction in Colorectal Cancer from H&amp;E Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally, with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior, therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%; HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p &lt; 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens, replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between treatments.</description>

      <title>Scaling Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Tumor Early Detection with More Reports, Fewer Masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence (AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly, requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%, surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably, R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate, bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor types.
  We plan to release our trained models, code, and dataset at https://github.com/MrGiovanni/R-Super</description>

      <title>Unifying Environment Perception and Route Choice Modeling for Trajectory Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.</description>

      <title>FraQAT: Quantization Aware Training with Fractional bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4 bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana, \pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).</description>

      <title>Scaling Tumor Segmentation: Best Lessons from Real and Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data, we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130 tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver, kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23 expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs. It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.</description>

      <title>QDepth-VLA: Quantized Depth Prediction as Auxiliary Supervision for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential 3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder, enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>ImagerySearch: Adaptive Test-Time Search for Video Generation Beyond Semantic Dependency Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video generation.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework for Skin Lesion Classification, ABCDE Feature Quantification, and Evolution Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A, B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall, this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of skin cancer progression.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal video data-pipelines for machine learning with minimal human supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans, languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -&gt; semantic or text -&gt; sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently distilled into a low-parameter (&lt;1M) can have competitive results compared to models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work, we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition, offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in the project page.</description>

      <title>TOUCH: Text-guided Controllable Generation of Free-Form Hand-Object Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent. Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language. Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing, poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

      <title>BADAS: Context Aware Collision Prediction Using Real-World Dashcam Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation. We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision prediction research.</description>

      <title>ScaleWeaver: Weaving Efficient Controllable T2I Generation with Multi-Scale Reference Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency. While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information. Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.</description>

      <title>You May Speak Freely: Improving the Fine-Grained Visual Recognition Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models with Answer Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge. Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings, we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural language.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multimodal LLM Descriptions of Activity for Explainable Semi-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level, our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets without interaction anomalies.</description>

      <title>MaskCaptioner : Learning to Jointly Segment and Caption Object Trajectories in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting, tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language. Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are available at https://www.gabriel.fiastre.fr/maskcaptioner/.</description>

      <title>3D Scene Prompting for Scene-Consistent Camera-Controllable Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality.

      <title>OmniMotion: Multimodal Motion Generation with Continuous Masked Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges: creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer, where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization, we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance. The code of our method will be made public.</description>

      <title>RealDPO: Real or Not Real, that is the Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>MathCanvas: Intrinsic Visual Chain-of-Thought for Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity, strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing. Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project Page: https://mathcanvas.github.io/</description>

      <title>C4D: 4D Made from 3D through Dual Correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to 4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information, facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes. Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and point tracking.

      <title>RainDiff: End-to-end Precipitation Nowcasting Via Token-wise Attention Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder, adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion, thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.</description>

      <title>ChangingGrounding: 3D Visual Grounding in Changing Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding (3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that 3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point, we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target, and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications. Project page: https://hm123450.github.io/CGB/ .</description>

      <title>WithAnyone: Towards Controllable and ID Consistent Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we (1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2) introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable generation.</description>

      <title>Ponimator: Unfolding Interactive Pose for Versatile Human-human Interaction Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics, drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors, Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Terra: Explorable Native 3D World Model with Point Latents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and generation with high 3D consistency.</description>

      <title>Learning an Image Editing Model without Image Editing Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data, our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.</description>

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-) How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.</description>

      <title>Coupled Diffusion Sampling for Training-Free Multi-View Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for multi-view consistent editing.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Social Media: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25991v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios, however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world multimodal deception detection.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Large Language Models for Medical VQA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical NLP tasks.</description>

      <title>Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting for Robust Gradual Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$ (progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains. Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Dramwig/STDW.</description>

      <title>GenCellAgent: Generalizable, Training-Free Cellular Image Segmentation via Large Language Model Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular image segmentation is essential for quantitative biology yet remains difficult due to heterogeneous modalities, morphological variability, and limited annotations. We present GenCellAgent, a training-free multi-agent framework that orchestrates specialist segmenters and generalist vision-language models via a planner-executor-evaluator loop (choose tool $\rightarrow$ run $\rightarrow$ quality-check) with long-term memory. The system (i) automatically routes images to the best tool, (ii) adapts on the fly using a few reference images when imaging conditions differ from what a tool expects, (iii) supports text-guided segmentation of organelles not covered by existing models, and (iv) commits expert edits to memory, enabling self-evolution and personalized workflows. Across four cell-segmentation benchmarks, this routing yields a 15.7\% mean accuracy gain over state-of-the-art baselines. On endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria from new datasets, GenCellAgent improves average IoU by 37.6\% over specialist models. It also segments novel objects such as the Golgi apparatus via iterative text-guided refinement, with light human correction further boosting performance. Together, these capabilities provide a practical path to robust, adaptable cellular image segmentation without retraining, while reducing annotation burden and matching user preferences.</description>

      <title>Weight Weaving: Parameter Pooling for Data-Free Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining. Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters $\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually. Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data (data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9 percentage points in a data-free setting.</description>

      <title>Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing. Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal (regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity). Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements, often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses, and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional fidelity losses for inverse problems.</description>

      <title>PoissonNet: A Local-Global Approach for Learning on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability -- both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples. These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces. Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that learn on surfaces.</description>

      <title>Towards Reversible Model Merging For Low-rank Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model. Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed, recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed models by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Spatio-Temporal Echocardiography Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain adaptation methods aim to bridge the gap between datasets by enabling knowledge transfer across domains, reducing the need for additional expert annotations. However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator, which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques without the need for any labels on the target domain.

      <description>arXiv:2510.14293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness, generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability. Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns (straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23 participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>A Density-Informed Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Framework for Improving Breast Cancer Detection Across All Breast Densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mammography, the current standard for breast cancer screening, has reduced sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, contributing to missed or delayed diagnoses. Thermalytix, an AI-based thermal imaging modality, captures functional vascular and metabolic cues that may complement mammographic structural data. This study investigates whether a breast density-informed multi-modal AI framework can improve cancer detection by dynamically selecting the appropriate imaging modality based on breast tissue composition. A total of 324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. Mammography images were analyzed using a multi-view deep learning model, while Thermalytix assessed thermal images through vascular and thermal radiomics. The proposed framework utilized Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for dense breasts, optimizing predictions based on tissue type. This multi-modal AI framework achieved a sensitivity of 94.55% (95% CI: 88.54-100) and specificity of 79.93% (95% CI: 75.14-84.71), outperforming standalone mammography AI (sensitivity 81.82%, specificity 86.25%) and Thermalytix AI (sensitivity 92.73%, specificity 75.46%). Importantly, the sensitivity of Mammography dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%), whereas Thermalytix AI maintained high and consistent sensitivity in both (92.59% and 92.86%, respectively). This demonstrates that a density-informed multi-modal AI framework can overcome key limitations of unimodal screening and deliver high performance across diverse breast compositions. The proposed framework is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable, offering a practical path to improving breast cancer screening outcomes in both high-resource and resource-limited settings.</description>

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant, demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.</description>

      <title>Deep Compositional Phase Diffusion for Long Motion Sequence Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research on motion generation has shown significant progress in generating semantically aligned motion with singular semantics. However, when employing these models to create composite sequences containing multiple semantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the continuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips, resulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these challenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module (TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from adjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM operate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the pre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them to learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from variable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating compositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input conditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding and succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made possible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed throughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the proposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios.

      <title>GOPLA: Generalizable Object Placement Learning via Synthetic Augmentation of Human Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility (e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data. Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Supervised Fine-Tuning or Contrastive Learning? Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders, various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts ''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components: weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and applications in this area.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Unlearning by Linear Task Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety. Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks. This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space, finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement. Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present state-of-the-art defenses.</description>

      <title>DialectGen: Benchmarking and Improving Dialect Robustness in Multimodal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200 unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance by small margins (&lt; 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.</description>

      <title>From Language to Locomotion: Retargeting-free Humanoid Control via Motion Latent Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable. They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages. Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for vision-language-action humanoid systems.</description>

      <title>RDD: Retrieval-Based Demonstration Decomposer for Planner Alignment in Long-Horizon Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action (VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer (RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are available at rdd-neurips.github.io.</description>

      <title>pi-Flow: Policy-Based Few-Step Generation via Imitation Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep. The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while maintaining teacher-level quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth observation (EO) in open-world settings presents a unique challenge: different applications rely on diverse sensor modalities, each with varying ground sampling distances, spectral ranges, and numbers of spectral bands. However, existing EO foundation models are typically tailored to specific sensor types, making them inflexible when generalizing across the heterogeneous landscape of EO data. To address this, we propose the Dynamic One-For-All (DOFA) model, a unified, multimodal foundation framework designed for diverse vision tasks in EO. Inspired by neural plasticity, DOFA utilizes a wavelength-conditioned dynamic hypernetwork to process inputs from five distinct satellite sensors flexibly. By continually pretraining on five EO modalities, DOFA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks and generalizes well to unseen modalities. Enhanced with hybrid continual pretraining, DOFA+ requires significantly fewer computational resources while outperforming counterparts trained with extensive GPU budgets. Experiments on diverse datasets highlight DOFA's potential as a foundation for general-purpose vision models in the sensor-diverse EO domain. The code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/DOFA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-world entity segmentation, as an emerging computer vision task, aims at segmenting entities in images without being restricted by pre-defined classes, offering impressive generalization capabilities on unseen images and concepts. Despite its promise, existing entity segmentation methods like Segment Anything Model (SAM) rely heavily on costly expert annotators. This work presents Self-supervised Open-world Hierarchical Entity Segmentation (SOHES), a novel approach that eliminates the need for human annotations. SOHES operates in three phases: self-exploration, self-instruction, and self-correction. Given a pre-trained self-supervised representation, we produce abundant high-quality pseudo-labels through visual feature clustering. Then, we train a segmentation model on the pseudo-labels, and rectify the noises in pseudo-labels via a teacher-student mutual-learning procedure. Beyond segmenting entities, SOHES also captures their constituent parts, providing a hierarchical understanding of visual entities. Using raw images as the sole training data, our method achieves unprecedented performance in self-supervised open-world segmentation, marking a significant milestone towards high-quality open-world entity segmentation in the absence of human-annotated masks.

      <title>Incomplete Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Detection via Cross-Modal Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13571v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies of multimodal industrial anomaly detection (IAD) based on 3D point clouds and RGB images have highlighted the importance of exploiting the redundancy and complementarity among modalities for accurate classification and segmentation. However, achieving multimodal IAD in practical production lines remains a work in progress. It is essential to consider the trade-offs between the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of new modalities while ensuring compatibility with current processes. Existing quality control processes combine rapid in-line inspections, such as optical and infrared imaging with high-resolution but time-consuming near-line characterization techniques, including industrial CT and electron microscopy to manually or semi-automatically locate and analyze defects in the production of Li-ion batteries and composite materials. Given the cost and time limitations, only a subset of the samples can be inspected by all in-line and near-line methods, and the remaining samples are only evaluated through one or two forms of in-line inspection. To fully exploit data for deep learning-driven automatic defect detection, the models must have the ability to leverage multimodal training and handle incomplete modalities during inference. In this paper, we propose CMDIAD, a Cross-Modal Distillation framework for IAD to demonstrate the feasibility of a Multi-modal Training, Few-modal Inference (MTFI) pipeline. Our findings show that the MTFI pipeline can more effectively utilize incomplete multimodal information compared to applying only a single modality for training and inference. Moreover, we investigate the reasons behind the asymmetric performance improvement using point clouds or RGB images as the main modality of inference. This provides a foundation for our future multimodal dataset construction with additional modalities from manufacturing scenarios.</description>

      <title>AttenCraft: Attention-guided Disentanglement of Multiple Concepts for Text-to-Image Customization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) customization empowers users to adapt the T2I diffusion model to new concepts absent in the pre-training dataset. On this basis, capturing multiple new concepts from a single image has emerged as a new task, allowing the model to learn multiple concepts simultaneously or discard unwanted concepts. However, multiple-concept disentanglement remains a key challenge. Existing disentanglement models often exhibit two main issues: feature fusion and asynchronous learning across different concepts. To address these issues, we propose AttenCraft, an attention-based method for multiple-concept disentanglement. Our method uses attention maps to generate accurate masks for each concept in a single initialization step, aiding in concept disentanglement without requiring mask preparation from humans or specialized models. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive algorithm based on attention scores to estimate sampling ratios for different concepts, promoting balanced feature acquisition and synchronized learning. AttenCraft also introduces a feature-retaining training framework that employs various loss functions to enhance feature recognition and prevent fusion. Extensive experiments show that our model effectively mitigates these two issues, achieving state-of-the-art image fidelity and comparable prompt fidelity to baseline models.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Reliable Guidance for Unpaired Multi-view Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this thesis, we address the challenging problem of unpaired multi-view clustering (UMC), which aims to achieve effective joint clustering using unpaired samples observed across multiple views. Traditional incomplete multi-view clustering (IMC) methods typically rely on paired samples to capture complementary information between views. However, such strategies become impractical in the UMC due to the absence of paired samples. Although some researchers have attempted to address this issue by preserving consistent cluster structures across views, effectively mining such consistency remains challenging when the cluster structures {with low confidence}. Therefore, we propose a novel method, Multi-level Reliable Guidance for UMC (MRG-UMC), which integrates multi-level clustering and reliable view guidance to learn consistent and confident cluster structures from three perspectives. Specifically, inner-view multi-level clustering exploits high-confidence sample pairs across different levels to reduce the impact of boundary samples, resulting in more confident cluster structures. Synthesized-view alignment leverages a synthesized-view to mitigate cross-view discrepancies and promote consistency. Cross-view guidance employs a reliable view guidance strategy to enhance the clustering confidence of poorly clustered views. These three modules are jointly optimized across multiple levels to achieve consistent and confident cluster structures. Furthermore, theoretical analyses verify the effectiveness of MRG-UMC in enhancing clustering confidence. Extensive experimental results show that MRG-UMC outperforms state-of-the-art UMC methods, achieving an average NMI improvement of 12.95\% on multi-view datasets. {The source code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MRG-UMC-5E20.</description>

      <title>Shape of Motion: 4D Reconstruction from a Single Video</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monocular dynamic reconstruction is a challenging and long-standing vision problem due to the highly ill-posed nature of the task. Existing approaches depend on templates, are effective only in quasi-static scenes, or fail to model 3D motion explicitly. We introduce a method for reconstructing generic dynamic scenes, featuring explicit, persistent 3D motion trajectories in the world coordinate frame, from casually captured monocular videos. We tackle the problem with two key insights: First, we exploit the low-dimensional structure of 3D motion by representing scene motion with a compact set of SE(3) motion bases. Each point's motion is expressed as a linear combination of these bases, facilitating soft decomposition of the scene into multiple rigidly-moving groups. Second, we take advantage of off-the-shelf data-driven priors such as monocular depth maps and long-range 2D tracks, and devise a method to effectively consolidate these noisy supervisory signals, resulting in a globally consistent representation of the dynamic scene. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for both long-range 3D/2D motion estimation and novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes.

      <title>GRAB: A Challenging GRaph Analysis Benchmark for Large Multimodal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have exhibited proficiencies across many visual tasks. Although numerous well-known benchmarks exist to evaluate model performance, they increasingly have insufficient headroom. As such, there is a pressing need for a new generation of benchmarks challenging enough for the next generation of LMMs. One area that LMMs show potential is graph analysis, specifically, the tasks an analyst might typically perform when interpreting figures such as estimating the mean, intercepts or correlations of functions and data series. In this work, we introduce GRAB, a graph analysis benchmark, fit for current and future frontier LMMs. Our benchmark is predominantly synthetic, ensuring high-quality, noise-free questions. GRAB is comprised of 3284 questions, covering five tasks and 23 graph properties. We evaluate 20 LMMs on GRAB, finding it to be a challenging benchmark, with the highest performing model attaining a score of just 21.0%. Finally, we conduct various ablations to investigate where the models succeed and struggle. We release GRAB and a lightweight GRAB-Lite to encourage progress in this important, growing domain.</description>

      <title>The Fluorescent Veil: A Stealthy and Effective Physical Adversarial Patch Against Traffic Sign Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems have become a prominent target for physical adversarial attacks. These attacks typically rely on conspicuous stickers and projections, or using invisible light and acoustic signals that can be easily blocked. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack medium, i.e., fluorescent ink, to design a stealthy and effective physical adversarial patch, namely FIPatch, to advance the state-of-the-art. Specifically, we first model the fluorescence effect in the digital domain to identify the optimal attack settings, which guide the real-world fluorescence parameters. By applying a carefully designed fluorescence perturbation to the target sign, the attacker can later trigger a fluorescent effect using invisible ultraviolet light, causing the TSR system to misclassify the sign and potentially leading to traffic accidents. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of FIPatch, which shows a success rate of 98.31% in low-light conditions. Furthermore, our attack successfully bypasses five popular defenses and achieves a success rate of 96.72%.</description>

      <title>Impact of Regularization on Calibration and Robustness: from the Representation Space Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that regularization techniques using soft labels, e.g., label smoothing, Mixup, and CutMix, not only enhance image classification accuracy but also mitigate miscalibration due to overconfident predictions, and improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However, the underlying mechanisms of such improvements remain underexplored. In this paper, we offer a novel explanation from the perspective of the representation space (i.e., the space of the features obtained at the penultimate layer). Based on examination of decision boundaries and structure of features (or representation vectors), our study investigates confidence contours and gradient directions within the representation space. Furthermore, we analyze the adjustments in feature distributions due to regularization in relation to these contours and directions, from which we uncover central mechanisms inducing improved calibration and robustness. Our findings provide new insights into the characteristics of the high-dimensional representation space in relation to training and regularization using soft labels.</description>

      <title>Emergent Visual Grounding in Large Multimodal Models Without Grounding Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current large multimodal models (LMMs) face challenges in grounding, which requires the model to relate language components to visual entities. Contrary to the common practice that fine-tunes LMMs with additional grounding supervision, we find that the grounding ability can in fact emerge in LMMs trained without explicit grounding supervision. To reveal this emerging grounding, we introduce an "attend-and-segment" method which leverages attention maps from standard LMMs to perform pixel-level segmentation. Furthermore, to enhance the grounding ability, we propose DIFFLMM, an LMM utilizing a diffusion-based visual encoder, as opposed to the standard CLIP visual encoder, and trained with the same weak supervision. Without being constrained by the biases and limited scale of grounding-specific supervision data, our approach is more generalizable and scalable. We achieve competitive performance on both grounding-specific and general visual question answering benchmarks, compared with grounding LMMs and generalist LMMs, respectively. Notably, we achieve a 44.2 grounding mask recall on grounded conversation generation without any grounding supervision, outperforming the extensively supervised model GLaMM.

      <description>arXiv:2412.10426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the task of advertisement image generation and introduce three evaluation metrics to assess Creativity, prompt Alignment, and Persuasiveness (CAP) in generated advertisement images. Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation and their performance in generating high-quality images for explicit descriptions, evaluating these models remains challenging. Existing evaluation methods focus largely on assessing alignment with explicit, detailed descriptions, but evaluating alignment with visually implicit prompts remains an open problem. Additionally, creativity and persuasiveness are essential qualities that enhance the effectiveness of advertisement images, yet are seldom measured. To address this, we propose three novel metrics for evaluating the creativity, alignment, and persuasiveness of generated images. Our findings reveal that current T2I models struggle with creativity, persuasiveness, and alignment when the input text is implicit messages. We further introduce a simple yet effective approach to enhance T2I models' capabilities in producing images that are better aligned, more creative, and more persuasive.</description>

      <title>Perspective-Aware Teaching: Adapting Knowledge for Heterogeneous Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) involves transferring knowledge from a pre-trained heavy teacher model to a lighter student model, thereby reducing the inference cost while maintaining comparable effectiveness. Prior KD techniques typically assume homogeneity between the teacher and student models. However, as technology advances, a wide variety of architectures have emerged, ranging from initial Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Multi-Level Perceptrons (MLPs). Consequently, developing a universal KD framework compatible with any architecture has become an important research topic. In this paper, we introduce a perspective-aware teaching (PAT) KD framework to enable feature distillation across diverse architectures. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we design prompt tuning blocks that incorporate student feedback, allowing teacher features to adapt to the student model's learning process. Second, we propose region-aware attention to mitigate the view mismatch problem between heterogeneous architectures. By leveraging these two modules, effective distillation of intermediate features can be achieved across heterogeneous architectures. Extensive experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and COCO demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/jimmylin0979/PAT.git.</description>

      <title>HuGDiffusion: Generalizable Single-Image Human Rendering via 3D Gaussian Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present HuGDiffusion, a generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) learning pipeline to achieve novel view synthesis (NVS) of human characters from single-view input images. Existing approaches typically require monocular videos or calibrated multi-view images as inputs, whose applicability could be weakened in real-world scenarios with arbitrary and/or unknown camera poses. In this paper, we aim to generate the set of 3DGS attributes via a diffusion-based framework conditioned on human priors extracted from a single image. Specifically, we begin with carefully integrated human-centric feature extraction procedures to deduce informative conditioning signals. Based on our empirical observations that jointly learning the whole 3DGS attributes is challenging to optimize, we design a multi-stage generation strategy to obtain different types of 3DGS attributes. To facilitate the training process, we investigate constructing proxy ground-truth 3D Gaussian attributes as high-quality attribute-level supervision signals. Through extensive experiments, our HuGDiffusion shows significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Volumetric rendering has become central to modern novel view synthesis methods, which use differentiable rendering to optimize 3D scene representations directly from observed views. While many recent works build on NeRF or 3D Gaussians, we explore an alternative volumetric scene representation. More specifically, we introduce two new scene representations based on linear primitives - octahedra and tetrahedra - both of which define homogeneous volumes bounded by triangular faces. To optimize these primitives, we present a differentiable rasterizer that runs efficiently on GPUs, allowing end-to-end gradient-based optimization while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. Through experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art volumetric methods while requiring fewer primitives to achieve similar reconstruction fidelity. Our findings deepen the understanding of 3D representations by providing insights into the fidelity and performance characteristics of transparent polyhedra and suggest that adopting novel primitives can expand the available design space.</description>

      <title>TRACE: Your Diffusion Model is Secretly an Instance Edge Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality instance and panoptic segmentation has traditionally relied on dense instance-level annotations such as masks, boxes, or points, which are costly, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Unsupervised and weakly-supervised approaches reduce this burden but remain constrained by semantic backbone constraints and human bias, often producing merged or fragmented outputs. We present TRACE (TRAnsforming diffusion Cues to instance Edges), showing that text-to-image diffusion models secretly function as instance edge annotators. TRACE identifies the Instance Emergence Point (IEP) where object boundaries first appear in self-attention maps, extracts boundaries through Attention Boundary Divergence (ABDiv), and distills them into a lightweight one-step edge decoder. This design removes the need for per-image diffusion inversion, achieving 81x faster inference while producing sharper and more connected boundaries. On the COCO benchmark, TRACE improves unsupervised instance segmentation by +5.1 AP, and in tag-supervised panoptic segmentation it outperforms point-supervised baselines by +1.7 PQ without using any instance-level labels. These results reveal that diffusion models encode hidden instance boundary priors, and that decoding these signals offers a practical and scalable alternative to costly manual annotation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a holistic vision-language foundation model tailored for remote sensing, named Falcon. Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.</description>

      <title>Spot the Fake: Large Multimodal Model-Based Synthetic Image Detection with Artifact Explanation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technologies, synthetic images have become increasingly prevalent in everyday life, posing new challenges for authenticity assessment and detection. Despite the effectiveness of existing methods in evaluating image authenticity and locating forgeries, these approaches often lack human interpretability and do not fully address the growing complexity of synthetic data. To tackle these challenges, we introduce FakeVLM, a specialized large multimodal model designed for both general synthetic image and DeepFake detection tasks. FakeVLM not only excels in distinguishing real from fake images but also provides clear, natural language explanations for image artifacts, enhancing interpretability. Additionally, we present FakeClue, a comprehensive dataset containing over 100,000 images across seven categories, annotated with fine-grained artifact clues in natural language. FakeVLM demonstrates performance comparable to expert models while eliminating the need for additional classifiers, making it a robust solution for synthetic data detection. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets confirm the superiority of FakeVLM in both authenticity classification and artifact explanation tasks, setting a new benchmark for synthetic image detection. The code, model weights, and dataset can be found here: https://github.com/opendatalab/FakeVLM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Omnimatte, one aims to decompose a given video into semantically meaningful layers, including the background and individual objects along with their associated effects, such as shadows and reflections. Existing methods often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects, and composite those objects onto new videos. These are accomplished by adapting zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. To overcome this, we introduce temporal and spatial attention guidance modules that steer the diffusion process for accurate object removal and temporally consistent background reconstruction. We further show that self-attention maps capture information about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time performance with minimal frame runtime.</description>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have lead to major improvements in multimodal reasoning, yet they still struggle to understand user-specific concepts. Existing personalization methods address this limitation but heavily rely on training procedures, that can be either costly or unpleasant to individual users. We depart from existing work, and for the first time explore the training-free setting in the context of personalization. We propose a novel method, Retrieval and Reasoning for Personalization (R2P), leveraging internal knowledge of VLMs. First, we leverage VLMs to extract the concept fingerprint, i.e., key attributes uniquely defining the concept within its semantic class. When a query arrives, the most similar fingerprints are retrieved and scored via chain-of-thought-reasoning. To reduce the risk of hallucinations, the scores are validated through cross-modal verification at the attribute level: in case of a discrepancy between the scores, R2P refines the concept association via pairwise multimodal matching, where the retrieved fingerprints and their images are directly compared with the query. We validate R2P on two publicly available benchmarks and a newly introduced dataset, Personal Concepts with Visual Ambiguity (PerVA), for concept identification highlighting challenges in visual ambiguity. R2P consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various downstream tasks across all benchmarks. Code will be available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>3DOT: Texture Transfer for 3DGS Objects from a Single Reference Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D texture swapping allows for the customization of 3D object textures, enabling efficient and versatile visual transformations in 3D editing. While no dedicated method exists, adapted 2D editing and text-driven 3D editing approaches can serve this purpose. However, 2D editing requires frame-by-frame manipulation, causing inconsistencies across views, while text-driven 3D editing struggles to preserve texture characteristics from reference images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce 3DSwapping, a 3D texture swapping method that integrates: 1) progressive generation, 2) view-consistency gradient guidance, and 3) prompt-tuned gradient guidance. To ensure view consistency, our progressive generation process starts by editing a single reference image and gradually propagates the edits to adjacent views. Our view-consistency gradient guidance further reinforces consistency by conditioning the generation model on feature differences between consistent and inconsistent outputs. To preserve texture characteristics, we introduce prompt-tuning-based gradient guidance, which learns a token that precisely captures the difference between the reference image and the 3D object. This token then guides the editing process, ensuring more consistent texture preservation across views. Overall, 3DSwapping integrates these novel strategies to achieve higher-fidelity texture transfer while preserving structural coherence across multiple viewpoints. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm that our three novel components enable convincing and effective 2D texture swapping for 3D objects. Code will be available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>On Large Multimodal Models as Open-World Image Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional image classification requires a predefined list of semantic categories. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can sidestep this requirement by classifying images directly using natural language (e.g., answering the prompt "What is the main object in the image?"). Despite this remarkable capability, most existing studies on LMM classification performance are surprisingly limited in scope, often assuming a closed-world setting with a predefined set of categories. In this work, we address this gap by thoroughly evaluating LMM classification performance in a truly open-world setting. We first formalize the task and introduce an evaluation protocol, defining various metrics to assess the alignment between predicted and ground truth classes. We then evaluate 13 models across 10 benchmarks, encompassing prototypical, non-prototypical, fine-grained, and very fine-grained classes, demonstrating the challenges LMMs face in this task. Further analyses based on the proposed metrics reveal the types of errors LMMs make, highlighting challenges related to granularity and fine-grained capabilities, showing how tailored prompting and reasoning can alleviate them.</description>

      <title>ELASTIC: Efficient Once For All Iterative Search for Object Detection on Microcontrollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deploying high-performance object detectors on TinyML platforms poses significant challenges due to tight hardware constraints and the modular complexity of modern detection pipelines. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) offers a path toward automation, but existing methods either restrict optimization to individual modules, sacrificing cross-module synergy, or require global searches that are computationally intractable. We propose ELASTIC (Efficient Once for AlL IterAtive Search for ObjecT DetectIon on MiCrocontrollers), a unified, hardware-aware NAS framework that alternates optimization across modules (e.g., backbone, neck, and head) in a cyclic fashion. ELASTIC introduces a novel Population Passthrough mechanism in evolutionary search that retains high-quality candidates between search stages, yielding faster convergence, up to an 8% final mAP gain, and eliminates search instability observed without population passthrough. In a controlled comparison, empirical results show ELASTIC achieves +4.75% higher mAP and 2x faster convergence than progressive NAS strategies on SVHN, and delivers a +9.09% mAP improvement on PascalVOC given the same search budget. ELASTIC achieves 72.3% mAP on PascalVOC, outperforming MCUNET by 20.9% and TinyissimoYOLO by 16.3%. When deployed on MAX78000/MAX78002 microcontrollers, ELASTICderived models outperform Analog Devices' TinySSD baselines, reducing energy by up to 71.6%, lowering latency by up to 2.4x, and improving mAP by up to 6.99 percentage points across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>EDIT: Enhancing Vision Transformers by Mitigating Attention Sink through an Encoder-Decoder Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose EDIT (Encoder-Decoder Image Transformer), a novel architecture designed to mitigate the attention sink phenomenon observed in Vision Transformer models. Attention sink occurs when an excessive amount of attention is allocated to the [CLS] token, distorting the model's ability to effectively process image patches. To address this, we introduce a layer-aligned encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder utilizes self-attention to process image patches, while the decoder uses cross-attention to focus on the [CLS] token. Unlike traditional encoder-decoder framework, where the decoder depends solely on high-level encoder representations, EDIT allows the decoder to extract information starting from low-level features, progressively refining the representation layer by layer. EDIT is naturally interpretable demonstrated through sequential attention maps, illustrating the refined, layer-by-layer focus on key image features. Experiments on ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k, along with transfer learning tasks, show that EDIT achieves consistent performance improvements over DeiT3 models. These results highlight the effectiveness of EDIT's design in addressing attention sink and improving visual feature extraction.</description>

      <title>KeyVID: Keyframe-Aware Video Diffusion for Audio-Synchronized Visual Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating video from various conditions, such as text, image, and audio, enables both spatial and temporal control, leading to high-quality generation results. Videos with dramatic motions often require a higher frame rate to ensure smooth motion. Currently, most audio-to-visual animation models use uniformly sampled frames from video clips. However, these uniformly sampled frames fail to capture significant key moments in dramatic motions at low frame rates and require significantly more memory when increasing the number of frames directly. In this paper, we propose KeyVID, a keyframe-aware audio-to-visual animation framework that significantly improves the generation quality for key moments in audio signals while maintaining computation efficiency. Given an image and an audio input, we first localize keyframe time steps from the audio. Then, we use a keyframe generator to generate the corresponding visual keyframes. Finally, we generate all intermediate frames using the motion interpolator. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that KeyVID significantly improves audio-video synchronization and video quality across multiple datasets, particularly for highly dynamic motions. The code is released in https://github.com/XingruiWang/KeyVID.</description>

      <title>On Equivariance and Fast Sampling in Video Diffusion Models Trained with Warped Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporally consistent video-to-video generation is critical for applications such as style transfer and upsampling. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of warped noise - a recently proposed technique for training video diffusion models - and show that pairing it with the standard denoising objective implicitly trains models to be equivariant to spatial transformations of the input noise, which we term EquiVDM. This equivariance enables motion in the input noise to align naturally with motion in the generated video, yielding coherent, high-fidelity outputs without the need for specialized modules or auxiliary losses. A further advantage is sampling efficiency: EquiVDM achieves comparable or superior quality in far fewer sampling steps. When distilled into one-step student models, EquiVDM preserves equivariance and delivers stronger motion controllability and fidelity than distilled nonequivariant baselines. Across benchmarks, EquiVDM consistently outperforms prior methods in motion alignment, temporal consistency, and perceptual quality, while substantially lowering sampling cost.</description>

      <title>ForensicHub: A Unified Benchmark &amp; Codebase for All-Domain Fake Image Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of Fake Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) is highly fragmented, encompassing four domains: deepfake detection (Deepfake), image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL), artificial intelligence-generated image detection (AIGC), and document image manipulation localization (Doc). Although individual benchmarks exist in some domains, a unified benchmark for all domains in FIDL remains blank. The absence of a unified benchmark results in significant domain silos, where each domain independently constructs its datasets, models, and evaluation protocols without interoperability, preventing cross-domain comparisons and hindering the development of the entire FIDL field. To close the domain silo barrier, we propose ForensicHub, the first unified benchmark &amp; codebase for all-domain fake image detection and localization. Considering drastic variations on dataset, model, and evaluation configurations across all domains, as well as the scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and the lack of individual benchmarks in some domains, ForensicHub: i) proposes a modular and configuration-driven architecture that decomposes forensic pipelines into interchangeable components across datasets, transforms, models, and evaluators, allowing flexible composition across all domains; ii) fully implements 10 baseline models, 6 backbones, 2 new benchmarks for AIGC and Doc, and integrates 2 existing benchmarks of DeepfakeBench and IMDLBenCo through an adapter-based design; iii) conducts indepth analysis based on the ForensicHub, offering 8 key actionable insights into FIDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation standards. ForensicHub represents a significant leap forward in breaking the domain silos in the FIDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>TinyRS-R1: Compact Multimodal Language Model for Remote Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote-sensing applications often run on edge hardware that cannot host today's 7B-parameter multimodal language models. This paper introduces TinyRS, the first 2B-parameter multimodal small language model (MSLM) optimized for remote sensing tasks, and TinyRS-R1, its reasoning-augmented variant. Built upon Qwen2-VL-2B, TinyRS is trained through a four-stage pipeline: pre-training on million satellite images, instruction tuning on visual instruction examples, fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations from the proposed reasoning dataset, and alignment via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). TinyRS-R1 achieves or surpasses the performance of recent 7B-parameter remote sensing models across classification, VQA, visual grounding, and open-ended question answering-while requiring just one-third of the memory and latency. Our analysis shows that CoT reasoning substantially benefits spatial grounding and scene understanding, while the non-reasoning TinyRS excels in concise, latency-sensitive VQA tasks. TinyRS-R1 represents the first domain-specialized MSLM with GRPO-aligned CoT reasoning for general-purpose remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models through Image-Guided Head Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks, large vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from "hallucinations", generating texts misaligned with the visual context. Existing methods aimed at reducing hallucinations through inference time intervention incur a significant increase in latency. To mitigate this, we present SPIN, a task-agnostic attention-guided head suppression strategy that can be seamlessly integrated during inference, without incurring any significant compute or latency overhead. We investigate whether hallucination in LVLMs can be linked to specific model components. Our analysis suggests that hallucinations can be attributed to a dynamic subset of attention heads in each layer. Leveraging this insight, for each text query token, we selectively suppress attention heads that exhibit low attention to image tokens, keeping the top-K attention heads intact. Extensive evaluations on visual question answering and image description tasks demonstrate the efficacy of SPIN in reducing hallucination scores up to 2.7x while maintaining F1, and improving throughput by 1.8x compared to existing alternatives. Code is available at https://github.com/YUECHE77/SPIN.</description>

      <title>Synthetic History: Evaluating Visual Representations of the Past in Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent historical contexts remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark for evaluating how TTI models depict historical contexts. The benchmark combines HistVis, a dataset of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three state-of-the-art diffusion models from carefully designed prompts covering universal human activities across multiple historical periods, with a reproducible evaluation protocol. We evaluate generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras; (2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible demographic patterns. By providing a reproducible benchmark for historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an initial step toward building more historically accurate TTI models.</description>

Abstract: Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements, including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce InfoDet, a dataset designed to support the development of accurate object detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 11,264 real and 90,000 synthetic infographics, with over 14 million bounding box annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of InfoDet through three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI element detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18668v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information. However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 440 chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning, 2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing. Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT) adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5% relative improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective management of agricultural landscapes is critical for meeting global biodiversity targets, but efforts are hampered by the absence of detailed, large-scale ecological maps. To address this, we introduce Farmscapes, the first large-scale (covering most of England), high-resolution (25cm) map of rural landscape features, including ecologically vital elements like hedgerows, woodlands, and stone walls. This map was generated using a deep learning segmentation model trained on a novel, dataset of 942 manually annotated tiles derived from aerial imagery. Our model accurately identifies key habitats, achieving high f1-scores for woodland (96\%) and farmed land (95\%), and demonstrates strong capability in segmenting linear features, with an F1-score of 72\% for hedgerows. By releasing the England-wide map on Google Earth Engine, we provide a powerful, open-access tool for ecologists and policymakers. This work enables data-driven planning for habitat restoration, supports the monitoring of initiatives like the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and lays the foundation for advanced analysis of landscape connectivity.</description>

      <title>MetaQAP - A Meta-Learning Approach for Quality-Aware Pretraining in Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models. Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD, KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD, 0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721 to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.</description>

      <title>CL-Splats: Continual Learning of Gaussian Splatting with Local Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI. As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>TopoStreamer: Temporal Lane Segment Topology Reasoning in Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Hyperparameter Optimization Effects on Lightweight Deep Models for Real-Time Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based networks are increasingly preferred for real-time image classification, especially on resource-constrained devices. This study evaluates the impact of hyperparameter optimization on the accuracy and deployment feasibility of seven modern lightweight architectures: ConvNeXt-T, EfficientNetV2-S, MobileNetV3-L, MobileViT v2 (S/XS), RepVGG-A2, and TinyViT-21M, trained on a class-balanced subset of 90,000 images from ImageNet-1K. Under standardized training settings, this paper investigates the influence of learning rate schedules, augmentation, optimizers, and initialization on model performance. Inference benchmarks are performed using an NVIDIA L40s GPU with batch sizes ranging from 1 to 512, capturing latency and throughput in real-time conditions. This work demonstrates that controlled hyperparameter variation significantly alters convergence dynamics in lightweight CNN and transformer backbones, providing insight into stability regions and deployment feasibility in edge artificial intelligence. Our results reveal that tuning alone leads to a top-1 accuracy improvement of 1.5 to 3.5 percent over baselines, and select models (e.g., RepVGG-A2, MobileNetV3-L) deliver latency under 5 milliseconds and over 9,800 frames per second, making them ideal for edge deployment. This work provides reproducible, subset-based insights into lightweight hyperparameter tuning and its role in balancing speed and accuracy.

      <title>FASTopoWM: Fast-Slow Lane Segment Topology Reasoning with Latent World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV) road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently, stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5% on OLS).</description>

      <title>UniEgoMotion: A Unified Model for Egocentric Motion Reconstruction, Forecasting, and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction, advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective. However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth 3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation via Probabilistic Gaussian Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15568v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Towards Inclusive Communication: A Unified Framework for Generating Spoken Language from Sign, Lip, and Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such audio-centric systems inherently exclude individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication. Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation. We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii) exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii) achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models across SLT, VSR, ASR, and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a key linguistic insight: explicitly modeling lip movements as a distinct modality significantly improves SLT performance by capturing critical non-manual cues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets, high-fidelity, realistic replicas of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC}}, and TUMTraf-I. Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.</description>

      <title>AvatarSync: Rethinking Talking-Head Animation through Phoneme-Guided Autoregressive Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Talking-head animation focuses on generating realistic facial videos from audio input. Following Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models have become the mainstream, owing to their robust generative capacities. However, inherent limitations of the diffusion process often lead to inter-frame flicker and slow inference, restricting their practical deployment. To address this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head animations from a single reference image, driven directly by text or audio input. To mitigate flicker and ensure continuity, AvatarSync leverages an autoregressive pipeline that enhances temporal modeling. In addition, to ensure controllability, we introduce phonemes, which are the basic units of speech sounds, and construct a many-to-one mapping from text/audio to phonemes, enabling precise phoneme-to-visual alignment. Additionally, to further accelerate inference, we adopt a two-stage generation strategy that decouples semantic modeling from visual dynamics, and incorporate a customized Phoneme-Frame Causal Attention Mask to support multi-step parallel acceleration. Extensive experiments conducted on both Chinese (CMLR) and English (HDTF) datasets demonstrate that AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a scalable and controllable solution.</description>

      <title>EdiVal-Agent: An Object-Centric Framework for Automated, Fine-Grained Evaluation of Multi-Turn Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images-resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models-or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise. To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated and fine-grained evaluation framework grounded in an object-centric perspective, designed to assess not only standard single-turn but also multi-turn instruction-based editing with precision. Given an input image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions while dynamically updating object pools across turns. These two stages enable two novel object-centric metrics tailored for multi-turn evaluation and one global metric of visual quality: (1) EdiVal-IF, which measures instruction following by combining open-vocabulary object detectors for symbolic checks with VLMs for semantic verification on detector-guided crops; (2) EdiVal-CC, which evaluates content consistency by calculating semantic similarity of unchanged objects and background using the evolving object pools; and (3) EdiVal-VQ, which quantifies changes in overall visual quality with human preference models. Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 13 state-of-the-art editing models spanning in-context, flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models.</description>

      <title>SCENEFORGE: Enhancing 3D-text alignment with Structured Scene Compositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets, significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet, as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely with textual instructions.</description>

      <title>Catching the Details: Self-Distilled RoI Predictors for Fine-Grained MLLM Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require high-resolution visual information to perform fine-grained perception, yet processing entire high-resolution images is computationally prohibitive. While recent methods leverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they typically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on large-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the model's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate, requiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow auto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient, annotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves this trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy attention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI labels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these labels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more precise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in a single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling RoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly multi-pass operations. To validate our approach, we integrate the framework into multiple MLLM families. Despite being trained on only a few (e.g. 10K) question-answer pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional data efficiency and generalization, achieving over a 10% absolute accuracy improvement on unseen benchmarks, including TextVQA, DocVQA, and V-Star. Our work presents a practical and scalable solution for enhancing the fine-grained perception of MLLMs without requiring costly supervision or full model fine-tuning.

      <title>From Easy to Hard: The MIR Benchmark for Progressive Interleaved Multi-Image Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Multi-image Interleaved Reasoning aims to improve Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) ability to jointly comprehend and reason across multiple images and their associated textual contexts, introducing unique challenges beyond single-image or non-interleaved multi-image tasks. While current multi-image benchmarks overlook interleaved textual contexts and neglect distinct relationships between individual images and their associated texts, enabling models to reason over multi-image interleaved data may significantly enhance their comprehension of complex scenes and better capture cross-modal correlations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark MIR, requiring joint reasoning over multiple images accompanied by interleaved textual contexts to accurately associate image regions with corresponding texts and logically connect information across images. To enhance MLLMs ability to comprehend multi-image interleaved data, we introduce reasoning steps for each instance within the benchmark and propose a stage-wise curriculum learning strategy. This strategy follows an "easy to hard" approach, progressively guiding models from simple to complex scenarios, thereby enhancing their ability to handle challenging tasks. Extensive experiments benchmarking multiple MLLMs demonstrate that our method significantly enhances models reasoning performance on MIR and other established benchmarks. We believe that MIR will encourage further research into multi-image interleaved reasoning, facilitating advancements in MLLMs capability to handle complex inter-modal tasks.</description>

      <title>ComposeMe: Attribute-Specific Image Prompts for Controllable Human Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating high-fidelity images of humans with fine-grained control over attributes such as hairstyle and clothing remains a core challenge in personalized text-to-image synthesis. While prior methods emphasize identity preservation from a reference image, they lack modularity and fail to provide disentangled control over specific visual attributes. We introduce a new paradigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of reference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of human appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes these inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This enables compositional and disentangled control over multiple visual factors, even across multiple people within a single image. To promote natural composition and robust disentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring subjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute cross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate faithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both identity and textual conditioning. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurately following both visual and textual prompts. Our framework paves the way for more configurable human image synthesis by combining visual prompting with text-driven generation.

      <title>DevFD: Developmental Face Forgery Detection by Learning Shared and Orthogonal LoRA Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal, language-aided framework for 3D scene graph alignment. Our method addresses the challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++ enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40% on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.</description>

      <title>Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image Composition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</description>

      <title>Earth-Agent: Unlocking the Full Landscape of Earth Observation with Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent. Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth observation.</description>

      <title>WorldSplat: Gaussian-Centric Feed-Forward 4D Scene Generation for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos; however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS). Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities. To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we propose WorldSplat, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent multi-track videos through two key steps: (i) We introduce a 4D-aware latent diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. (ii) Subsequently, we refine the novel view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WorldSplat effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

      <title>Attention Surgery: An Efficient Recipe to Linearize Your Video Diffusion Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly retraining. We introduce Attention Surgery, an efficient framework for linearizing or hybridizing attention in pretrained VDMs without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models, our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers. Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

      <title>ART-VITON: Measurement-Guided Latent Diffusion for Artifact-Free Virtual Try-On</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis, preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions. However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation, leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background, eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for 3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the 3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective, framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates, to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU memory to process thousands of images.

      <title>A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed input formats. We develop Ctrl-VI, a video synthesis method that addresses this need and generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.</description>

With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.

      <title>Real-Time Motion-Controllable Autoregressive Video Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control, then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page: https://kesenzhao.github.io/AR-Drag.github.io/.</description>

      <title>One Stone with Two Birds: A Null-Text-Null Frequency-Aware Diffusion Models for Text-Guided Image Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08273v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile, serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion models.

      <title>MSF-Mamba: Motion-aware State Fusion Mamba for Efficient Micro-Gesture Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently, Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models (SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition, previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba (MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely, MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-, Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.</description>

      <title>MetaCaptioner: Towards Generalist Visual Captioning with Open-source Suites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5% reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and cost-effective visual captioning solution.</description>

      <title>Beyond Seeing: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Tool-Enabled Image Perception, Transformation, and Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored. Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce VisualToolBench, a visual tool-use reasoning benchmark that rigorously evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under the think-with-images paradigm. VisualToolBench comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with images, VisualToolBench offers critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.</description>

      <title>SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data. Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40% compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.</description>

      <title>SVAG-Bench: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Multi-Instance Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.</description>

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving. However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images. SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation. CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/Lillian-research-hub/CymbaDiff</description>

      <title>Group-Wise Optimization for Self-Extensible Codebooks in Vector Quantized Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently, with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance. Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally, like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen datasets.</description>

      <title>Reasoning in Space via Grounding in the World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them. Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation, GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely without external modules while delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09868v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Principle of Maximum Entropy is a rigorous technique for estimating an unknown distribution given partial information while simultaneously minimizing bias. However, an important requirement for applying the principle is that the available information be provided error-free (Jaynes 1982). We relax this requirement using a memoryless communication channel as a framework to derive a new, more general principle. We show our new principle provides an upper bound on the entropy of the unknown distribution and the amount of information lost due to the use of a given communications channel is unknown unless the unknown distribution's entropy is also known. Using our new principle we provide a new interpretation of the classic principle and experimentally show its performance relative to the classic principle and other generally applicable solutions. Finally, we present a simple algorithm for solving our new principle and an approximation useful when samples are limited.</description>

      <title>TABSurfer: a Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture for Subcortical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subcortical segmentation remains challenging despite its important applications in quantitative structural analysis of brain MRI scans. The most accurate method, manual segmentation, is highly labor intensive, so automated tools like FreeSurfer have been adopted to handle this task. However, these traditional pipelines are slow and inefficient for processing large datasets. In this study, we propose TABSurfer, a novel 3D patch-based CNN-Transformer hybrid deep learning model designed for superior subcortical segmentation compared to existing state-of-the-art tools. To evaluate, we first demonstrate TABSurfer's consistent performance across various T1w MRI datasets with significantly shorter processing times compared to FreeSurfer. Then, we validate against manual segmentations, where TABSurfer outperforms FreeSurfer based on the manual ground truth. In each test, we also establish TABSurfer's advantage over a leading deep learning benchmark, FastSurferVINN. Together, these studies highlight TABSurfer's utility as a powerful tool for fully automated subcortical segmentation with high fidelity.</description>

      <title>Pruning Sparse Tensor Neural Networks Enables Deep Learning for 3D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) is a non-invasive technique that allows for the imaging of micro-vessels in vivo, at depth and with a resolution on the order of ten microns. ULM is based on the sub-resolution localization of individual microbubbles injected in the bloodstream. Mapping the whole angioarchitecture requires the accumulation of microbubbles trajectories from thousands of frames, typically acquired over a few minutes. ULM acquisition times can be reduced by increasing the microbubble concentration, but requires more advanced algorithms to detect them individually. Several deep learning approaches have been proposed for this task, but they remain limited to 2D imaging, in part due to the associated large memory requirements. Herein, we propose to use sparse tensor neural networks to reduce memory usage in 2D and to improve the scaling of the memory requirement for the extension of deep learning architecture to 3D. We study several approaches to efficiently convert ultrasound data into a sparse format and study the impact of the associated loss of information. When applied in 2D, the sparse formulation reduces the memory requirements by a factor 2 at the cost of a small reduction of performance when compared against dense networks. In 3D, the proposed approach reduces memory requirements by two order of magnitude while largely outperforming conventional ULM in high concentration settings. We show that Sparse Tensor Neural Networks in 3D ULM allow for the same benefits as dense deep learning based method in 2D ULM i.e. the use of higher concentration in silico and reduced acquisition time.</description>

      <title>Deep Few-view High-resolution Photon-counting CT at Halved Dose for Extremity Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) for extremity allows multi-energy high-resolution (HR) imaging but its radiation dose can be further improved. Despite the great potential of deep learning techniques, their application in HR volumetric PCCT reconstruction has been challenged by the large memory burden, training data scarcity, and domain gap issues. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for PCCT image reconstruction at halved dose and doubled speed validated in a New Zealand clinical trial. Specifically, we design a patch-based volumetric refinement network to alleviate the GPU memory limitation, train network with synthetic data, and use model-based iterative refinement to bridge the gap between synthetic and clinical data. Our results in a reader study of 8 patients from the clinical trial demonstrate a great potential to cut the radiation dose to half that of the clinical PCCT standard without compromising image quality and diagnostic value.</description>

      <title>VoxelPrompt: A Vision Agent for End-to-End Medical Image Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present VoxelPrompt, an end-to-end image analysis agent that tackles free-form radiological tasks. Given any number of volumetric medical images and a natural language prompt, VoxelPrompt integrates a language model that generates executable code to invoke a jointly-trained, adaptable vision network. This code further carries out analytical steps to address practical quantitative aims, such as measuring the growth of a tumor across visits. The pipelines generated by VoxelPrompt automate analyses that currently require practitioners to painstakingly combine multiple specialized vision and statistical tools. We evaluate VoxelPrompt using diverse neuroimaging tasks and show that it can delineate hundreds of anatomical and pathological features, measure complex morphological properties, and perform open-language analysis of lesion characteristics. VoxelPrompt performs these objectives with an accuracy similar to that of specialist single-task models for image analysis, while facilitating a broad range of compositional biomedical workflows.</description>

      <title>Moto: Latent Motion Token as the Bridging Language for Learning Robot Manipulation from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Boosted Model Merging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods) continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on both vision and language benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition to quantify task similarity, offering a new interpretable perspective on model merging.</description>

      <title>A Clinically-Grounded Two-Stage Framework for Renal CT Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective Renal cancer is a common malignancy and a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Computed tomography (CT) is central to early detection, staging, and treatment planning. However, the growing CT workload increases radiologists' burden and risks incomplete documentation. Automatically generating accurate reports remains challenging because it requires integrating visual interpretation with clinical reasoning. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language and vision-language models, offer potential to reduce workload and enhance diagnostic quality.
  Methods We propose a clinically informed, two-stage framework for automatic renal CT report generation. In Stage 1, a multi-task learning model detects structured clinical features from each 2D image. In Stage 2, a vision-language model generates free-text reports conditioned on the image and the detected features. To evaluate clinical fidelity, generated clinical features are extracted from the reports and compared with expert-annotated ground truth.
  Results Experiments on an expert-labeled dataset show that incorporating detected features improves both report quality and clinical accuracy. The model achieved an average AUC of 0.75 for key imaging features and a METEOR score of 0.33, demonstrating higher clinical consistency and fewer template-driven errors.
  Conclusion Linking structured feature detection with conditioned report generation provides a clinically grounded approach to integrate structured prediction and narrative drafting for renal CT reporting. This method enhances interpretability and clinical faithfulness, underscoring the value of domain-relevant evaluation metrics for medical AI development.</description>

      <title>Online Continual Learning via Spiking Neural Networks with Sleep Enhanced Latent Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment. However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes. Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic (NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several trajectory inference techniques towards matching a gradient flow, providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts, where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.</description>

      <title>HANS-Net: Hyperbolic Convolution and Adaptive Temporal Attention for Accurate and Generalizable Liver and Tumor Segmentation in CT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the AMOS 2022 dataset obtains an average Dice of 85.09%, IoU of 76.66%, ASSD of 19.49 mm, and VOE of 23.34%, indicating strong generalization across different datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor segmentation.</description>

      <title>WoW: Towards a World omniscient World model Through Embodied Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>RADAR: A Risk-Aware Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework for LLM Safety Evaluation via Role-Specialized Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Sign Masking for Task Vector Transport Across Pre-Trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and few-shot fine-tuning.</description>

Abstract: Human core object recognition depends on the selective use of visual information, but the strategies guiding these choices are difficult to measure directly. We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision. MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.</description>

      <title>NExT-OMNI: Towards Any-to-Any Omnimodal Foundation Models with Discrete Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13721</link>

Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal retrieval. In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs. Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data, NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and open-source both the code and model checkpoints.</description>

      <title>The Mechanistic Emergence of Symbol Grounding in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in (vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.</description>
