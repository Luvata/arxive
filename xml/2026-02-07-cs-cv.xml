      <title>SIDeR: Semantic Identity Decoupling for Unrestricted Face Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the deep integration of facial recognition into online banking, identity verification, and other networked services, achieving effective decoupling of identity information from visual representations during image storage and transmission has become a critical challenge for privacy protection. To address this issue, we propose SIDeR, a Semantic decoupling-driven framework for unrestricted face privacy protection. SIDeR decomposes a facial image into a machine-recognizable identity feature vector and a visually perceptible semantic appearance component. By leveraging semantic-guided recomposition in the latent space of a diffusion model, it generates visually anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining machine-level identity consistency. The framework incorporates momentum-driven unrestricted perturbation optimization and a semantic-visual balancing factor to synthesize multiple visually diverse, highly natural adversarial samples. Furthermore, for authorized access, the protected image can be restored to its original form when the correct password is provided. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that SIDeR achieves a 99% attack success rate in black-box scenarios and outperforms baseline methods by 41.28% in PSNR-based restoration quality.</description>

      <title>UniTrack: Differentiable Graph Representation Learning for Multi-Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present UniTrack, a plug-and-play graph-theoretic loss function designed to significantly enhance multi-object tracking (MOT) performance by directly optimizing tracking-specific objectives through unified differentiable learning. Unlike prior graph-based MOT methods that redesign tracking architectures, UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications. Through differentiable graph representation learning, UniTrack enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. We validate UniTrack across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested architectures and datasets including Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR, and MOTE. Extensive evaluations show up to 53\% reduction in identity switches and 12\% IDF1 improvements across challenging benchmarks, with GTR achieving peak performance gains of 9.7\% MOTA on SportsMOT.</description>

      <title>VISTA: Enhancing Visual Conditioning via Track-Following Preference Optimization in Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. Despite the success, extending large pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to the action space can induce vision-action misalignment, where action predictions exhibit weak dependence on the current visual state, leading to unreliable action outputs. In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models. Our approach first aligns action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and then transfers the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning. Without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection, our method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and further yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

      <title>Food Portion Estimation: From Pixels to Calories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliance on images for dietary assessment is an important strategy to accurately and conveniently monitor an individual's health, making it a vital mechanism in the prevention and care of chronic diseases and obesity. However, image-based dietary assessment suffers from estimating the three dimensional size of food from 2D image inputs. Many strategies have been devised to overcome this critical limitation such as the use of auxiliary inputs like depth maps, multi-view inputs, or model-based approaches such as template matching. Deep learning also helps bridge the gap by either using monocular images or combinations of the image and the auxillary inputs to precisely predict the output portion from the image input. In this paper, we explore the different strategies employed for accurate portion estimation.</description>

      <title>Visual concept ranking uncovers medical shortcuts used by large multimodal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains such as healthcare requires auditing methods that can uncover model shortcomings. We introduce a method for identifying important visual concepts within large multimodal models (LMMs) and use it to investigate the behaviors these models exhibit when prompted with medical tasks. We primarily focus on the task of classifying malignant skin lesions from clinical dermatology images, with supplemental experiments including both chest radiographs and natural images. After showing how LMMs display unexpected gaps in performance between different demographic subgroups when prompted with demonstrating examples, we apply our method, Visual Concept Ranking (VCR), to these models and prompts. VCR generates hypotheses related to different visual feature dependencies, which we are then able to validate with manual interventions.</description>

      <title>CLEAR-HPV: Interpretable Concept Discovery for HPV-Associated Morphology in Whole-Slide Histology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) status is a critical determinant of prognosis and treatment response in head and neck and cervical cancers. Although attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) achieves strong slide-level prediction for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, it provides limited morphologic interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept-Level Explainable Attention-guided Representation for HPV (CLEAR-HPV), a framework that restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training. Operating in an attention-weighted latent space, CLEAR-HPV automatically discovers keratinizing, basaloid, and stromal morphologic concepts, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector. CLEAR-HPV's concept-fraction vectors preserve the predictive information of the original MIL embeddings while reducing the high-dimensional feature space (e.g., 1536 dimensions) to only 10 interpretable concepts. CLEAR-HPV generalizes consistently across TCGA-HNSCC, TCGA-CESC, and CPTAC-HNSCC, providing compact, concept-level interpretability through a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology.</description>

      <title>ARGaze: Autoregressive Transformers for Online Egocentric Gaze Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online egocentric gaze estimation predicts where a camera wearer is looking from first-person video using only past and current frames, a task essential for augmented reality and assistive technologies. Unlike third-person gaze estimation, this setting lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from sparse, indirect cues such as hand-object interactions and salient scene content. We observe that gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities: knowing where a person looked recently provides a powerful prior for predicting where they look next. Inspired by vision-conditioned autoregressive decoding in vision-language models, we propose ARGaze, which reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction: at each timestep, a transformer decoder predicts current gaze by conditioning on (i) current visual features and (ii) a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates. This design enforces causality and enables bounded-resource streaming inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction. We will release our source code and pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>AirGlove: Exploring Egocentric 3D Hand Tracking and Appearance Generalization for Sensing Gloves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing gloves have become important tools for teleoperation and robotic policy learning as they are able to provide rich signals like speed, acceleration and tactile feedback. A common approach to track gloved hands is to directly use the sensor signals (e.g., angular velocity, gravity orientation) to estimate 3D hand poses. However, sensor-based tracking can be restrictive in practice as the accuracy is often impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality. Recent advances in vision-based approaches have achieved strong performance on human hands via large-scale pre-training, but their performance on gloved hands with distinct visual appearances remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups. Our analysis shows that existing bare-hand models suffer from substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to large appearance gap between bare-hand and glove designs. We therefore propose AirGlove, which leverages existing gloves to generalize the learned glove representations towards new gloves with limited data. Experiments with multiple sensing gloves show that AirGlove effectively generalizes the hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves a significant performance boost over the compared schemes.</description>

      <title>SHaSaM: Submodular Hard Sample Mining for Fair Facial Attribute Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often inherit social and demographic biases from annotated data during model training, leading to unfair predictions, especially in the presence of sensitive attributes like race, age, gender etc. Existing methods fall prey to the inherent data imbalance between attribute groups and inadvertently emphasize on sensitive attributes, worsening unfairness and performance. To surmount these challenges, we propose SHaSaM (Submodular Hard Sample Mining), a novel combinatorial approach that models fairness-driven representation learning as a submodular hard-sample mining problem. Our two-stage approach comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which introduces a submodular subset selection strategy to mine hard positives and negatives - effectively mitigating data imbalance, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces a family of combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes. This unified formulation restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater photography presents significant inherent challenges including reduced contrast, spatial blur, and wavelength-dependent color distortions. These effects can obscure the vibrancy of marine life and awareness photographers in particular are often challenged with heavy post-processing pipelines to correct for these distortions.
  We develop an image-to-image pipeline that learns to reverse underwater degradations by introducing a synthetic corruption pipeline and learning to reverse its effects with diffusion-based generation. Training and evaluation are performed on a small high-quality dataset of awareness photography images by Keith Ellenbogen. The proposed methodology achieves high perceptual consistency and strong generalization in synthesizing 512x768 images using a model of ~11M parameters after training from scratch on ~2.5k images.</description>

      <title>ShapePuri: Shape Guided and Appearance Generalized Adversarial Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate impressive performance in visual recognition, but they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that is imperceptible to the human. Although existing defense strategies such as adversarial training and purification have achieved progress, diffusion-based purification often involves high computational costs and information loss. To address these challenges, we introduce Shape Guided Purification (ShapePuri), a novel defense framework enhances robustness by aligning model representations with stable structural invariants. ShapePuri integrates two components: a Shape Encoding Module (SEM) that provides dense geometric guidance through Signed Distance Functions (SDF), and a Global Appearance Debiasing (GAD) module that mitigates appearance bias via stochastic transformations. In our experiments, ShapePuri achieves $84.06\%$ clean accuracy and $81.64\%$ robust accuracy under the AutoAttack protocol, representing the first defense framework to surpass the $80\%$ threshold on this benchmark. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient adversarial defense that preserves prediction stability during inference without requiring auxiliary modules or additional computational cost.</description>

      <title>PoseGaussian: Pose-Driven Novel View Synthesis for Robust 3D Human Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose PoseGaussian, a pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis. Human body pose serves a dual purpose in our design: as a structural prior, it is fused with a color encoder to refine depth estimation; as a temporal cue, it is processed by a dedicated pose encoder to enhance temporal consistency across frames. These components are integrated into a fully differentiable, end-to-end trainable pipeline. Unlike prior works that use pose only as a condition or for warping, PoseGaussian embeds pose signals into both geometric and temporal stages to improve robustness and generalization. It is specifically designed to address challenges inherent in dynamic human scenes, such as articulated motion and severe self-occlusion. Notably, our framework achieves real-time rendering at 100 FPS, maintaining the efficiency of standard Gaussian Splatting pipelines. We validate our approach on ZJU-MoCap, THuman2.0, and in-house datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and structural accuracy (PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, LPIPS 0.028).</description>

      <title>GT-SVJ: Generative-Transformer-Based Self-Supervised Video Judge For Efficient Video Reward Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning video generative models with human preferences remains challenging: current approaches rely on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling, but these models struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics. We propose a fundamentally different approach: repurposing video generative models, which are inherently designed to model temporal structure, as reward models. We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\times$ to $65\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Dual-Representation Image Compression at Ultra-Low Bitrates via Explicit Semantics and Implicit Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent neural codecs achieve strong performance at low bitrates when optimized for perceptual quality, their effectiveness deteriorates significantly under ultra-low bitrate conditions. To mitigate this, generative compression methods leveraging semantic priors from pretrained models have emerged as a promising paradigm. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism. Methods based on explicit representations preserve content structure but often lack fine-grained textures, whereas implicit methods can synthesize visually plausible details at the cost of semantic drift. In this work, we propose a unified framework that bridges this gap by coherently integrating explicit and implicit representations in a training-free manner. Specifically, We condition a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics while employing reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details. Moreover, we introduce a plug-in encoder that enables flexible control of the distortion-perception tradeoff by modulating the implicit information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods and surpassing DiffC by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on the Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>E.M.Ground: A Temporal Grounding Vid-LLM with Holistic Event Perception and Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs), Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which aims to precisely localize time segments corresponding to query events, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often match start and end frames by comparing frame features with two separate tokens, relying heavily on exact timestamps. However, this approach fails to capture the event's semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities. To address this, we propose E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for TVG that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception. E.M.Ground introduces three key innovations: (i) a special &lt;event&gt; token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event, preserving semantic continuity for accurate event matching; (ii) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities across timestamps, improving prediction accuracy; (iii) multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and temporal understanding, compensating for compression-induced information loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that E.M.Ground consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs by significant margins.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation via Multi-view Progressive Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation aims to segment categories in data-scarce domains conditioned on a few exemplars. Typical methods first establish few-shot capability in a large-scale source domain and then adapt it to target domains. However, due to the limited quantity and diversity of target samples, existing methods still exhibit constrained performance. Moreover, the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains, coupled with substantial domain gaps, severely hinders the effective utilization of target samples and further impedes adaptation. To this end, we propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which progressively adapts few-shot capability to target domains from both data and strategy perspectives. (i) From the data perspective, we introduce Hybrid Progressive Augmentation, which progressively generates more diverse and complex views through cumulative strong augmentations, thereby creating increasingly challenging learning scenarios. (ii) From the strategy perspective, we design Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction, which fully leverages these progressively complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths under extensive supervision. By jointly enforcing prediction consistency across diverse and complex views, MPA achieves both robust and accurate adaptation to target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPA effectively adapts few-shot capability to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).</description>

      <title>Boosting SAM for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation via Conditional Point Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in promptable segmentation, recent studies leverage SAM to develop training-free solutions for few-shot segmentation, which aims to predict object masks in the target image based on a few reference exemplars. These SAM-based methods typically rely on point matching between reference and target images and use the matched dense points as prompts for mask prediction. However, we observe that dense points perform poorly in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), where target images are from medical or satellite domains. We attribute this issue to large domain shifts that disrupt the point-image interactions learned by SAM, and find that point density plays a crucial role under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars. Leveraging ground-truth masks, the reference images provide reliable guidance for adaptively sparsifying dense matched points, enabling more accurate segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets.</description>

      <title>PatchFlow: Leveraging a Flow-Based Model with Patch Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Die casting plays a crucial role across various industries due to its ability to craft intricate shapes with high precision and smooth surfaces. However, surface defects remain a major issue that impedes die casting quality control. Recently, computer vision techniques have been explored to automate and improve defect detection. In this work, we combine local neighbor-aware patch features with a normalizing flow model and bridge the gap between the generic pretrained feature extractor and industrial product images by introducing an adapter module to increase the efficiency and accuracy of automated anomaly detection. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach reduces the error rate by 20\% on the MVTec AD dataset, achieving an image-level AUROC of 99.28\%. Our approach has also enhanced performance on the VisA dataset , achieving an image-level AUROC of 96.48\%. Compared to the state-of-the-art models, this represents a 28.2\% reduction in error. Additionally, experiments on a proprietary die casting dataset yield an accuracy of 95.77\% for anomaly detection, without requiring any anomalous samples for training. Our method illustrates the potential of leveraging computer vision and deep learning techniques to advance inspection capabilities for the die casting industry</description>

      <title>Active Label Cleaning for Reliable Detection of Electron Dense Deposits in Transmission Electron Microscopy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated detection of electron dense deposits (EDD) in glomerular disease is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. While crowdsourcing reduces annotation cost, it introduces label noise. We propose an active label cleaning method to efficiently denoise crowdsourced datasets. Our approach uses active learning to select the most valuable noisy samples for expert re-annotation, building high-accuracy cleaning models. A Label Selection Module leverages discrepancies between crowdsourced labels and model predictions for both sample selection and instance-level noise grading. Experiments show our method achieves 67.18% AP\textsubscript{50} on a private dataset, an 18.83% improvement over training on noisy labels. This performance reaches 95.79% of that with full expert annotation while reducing annotation cost by 73.30%. The method provides a practical, cost-effective solution for developing reliable medical AI with limited expert resources.</description>

      <title>RFM-Pose:Reinforcement-Guided Flow Matching for Fast Category-Level 6D Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and plays a critical role in virtual reality and embodied intelligence, where agents must understand and interact with objects in 3D space. Recently, score based generative models have to some extent solved the rotational symmetry ambiguity problem in category level pose estimation, but their efficiency remains limited by the high sampling cost of score-based diffusion. In this work, we propose a new framework, RFM-Pose, that accelerates category-level 6D object pose generation while actively evaluating sampled hypotheses. To improve sampling efficiency, we adopt a flow-matching generative model and generate pose candidates along an optimal transport path from a simple prior to the pose distribution. To further refine these candidates, we cast the flow-matching sampling process as a Markov decision process and apply proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy. In particular, we interpret the flow field as a learnable policy and map an estimator to a value network, enabling joint optimization of pose generation and hypothesis scoring within a reinforcement learning framework. Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark demonstrate that RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance while significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, similar to prior work, our approach can be readily adapted to object pose tracking and attains competitive results in this setting.</description>

      <title>ReGLA: Efficient Receptive-Field Modeling with Gated Linear Attention Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing accuracy and latency on high-resolution images is a critical challenge for lightweight models, particularly for Transformer-based architectures that often suffer from excessive latency. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ReGLA}, a series of lightweight hybrid networks, which integrates efficient convolutions for local feature extraction with ReLU-based gated linear attention for global modeling. The design incorporates three key innovations: the Efficient Large Receptive Field (ELRF) module for enhancing convolutional efficiency while preserving a large receptive field; the ReLU Gated Modulated Attention (RGMA) module for maintaining linear complexity while enhancing local feature representation; and a multi-teacher distillation strategy to boost performance on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ReGLA; particularly the ReGLA-M achieves \textbf{80.85\%} Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K at $224px$, with only \textbf{4.98 ms} latency at $512px$. Furthermore, ReGLA outperforms similarly scaled iFormer models in downstream tasks, achieving gains of \textbf{3.1\%} AP on COCO object detection and \textbf{3.6\%} mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, establishing it as a state-of-the-art solution for high-resolution visual applications.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Prototype Potential: An Efficient Tuning Framework for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) seeks to continuously learn new classes from very limited samples while preserving previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods often utilize a frozen pre-trained feature extractor to generate static class prototypes, which suffer from the inherent representation bias of the backbone. While recent prompt-based tuning methods attempt to adapt the backbone via minimal parameter updates, given the constraint of extreme data scarcity, the model's capacity to assimilate novel information and substantively enhance its global discriminative power is inherently limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shift in perspective: freezing the feature extractor while fine-tuning the prototypes. We argue that the primary challenge in FSCIL is not feature acquisition, but rather the optimization of decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space. To this end, we introduce an efficient prototype fine-tuning framework that evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets. These components function synergistically to improve the discriminative capacity of prototypes for ongoing incremental classes. Extensive results demonstrate that our method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.</description>

      <title>Magic-MM-Embedding: Towards Visual-Token-Efficient Universal Multimodal Embedding with MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown immense promise in universal multimodal retrieval, which aims to find relevant items of various modalities for a given query. But their practical application is often hindered by the substantial computational cost incurred from processing a large number of tokens from visual inputs. In this paper, we propose Magic-MM-Embedding, a series of novel models that achieve both high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in universal multimodal embedding. Our approach is built on two synergistic pillars: (1) a highly efficient MLLM architecture incorporating visual token compression to drastically reduce inference latency and memory footprint, and (2) a multi-stage progressive training strategy designed to not only recover but significantly boost performance. This coarse-to-fine training paradigm begins with extensive continue pretraining to restore multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, progresses to large-scale contrastive pretraining and hard negative mining to enhance discriminative power, and culminates in a task-aware fine-tuning stage guided by an MLLM-as-a-Judge for precise data curation. Comprehensive experiments show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin while being more inference-efficient.</description>

      <title>Fast-SAM3D: 3Dfy Anything in Images but Faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SAM3D enables scalable, open-world 3D reconstruction from complex scenes, yet its deployment is hindered by prohibitive inference latency. In this work, we conduct the \textbf{first systematic investigation} into its inference dynamics, revealing that generic acceleration strategies are brittle in this context. We demonstrate that these failures stem from neglecting the pipeline's inherent multi-level \textbf{heterogeneity}: the kinematic distinctiveness between shape and layout, the intrinsic sparsity of texture refinement, and the spectral variance across geometries. To address this, we present \textbf{Fast-SAM3D}, a training-free framework that dynamically aligns computation with instantaneous generation complexity. Our approach integrates three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: (1) \textit{Modality-Aware Step Caching} to decouple structural evolution from sensitive layout updates; (2) \textit{Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving} to concentrate refinement on high-entropy regions; and (3) \textit{Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation} to adapt decoding resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fast-SAM3D delivers up to \textbf{2.67$\times$} end-to-end speedup with negligible fidelity loss, establishing a new Pareto frontier for efficient single-view 3D generation. Our code is released in https://github.com/wlfeng0509/Fast-SAM3D.</description>

      <title>FlashBlock: Attention Caching for Efficient Long-Context Block Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating long-form content, such as minute-long videos and extended texts, is increasingly important for modern generative models. Block diffusion improves inference efficiency via KV caching and block-wise causal inference and has been widely adopted in diffusion language models and video generation. However, in long-context settings, block diffusion still incurs substantial overhead from repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache. We identify an underexplored property of block diffusion: cross-step redundancy of attention within a block. Our analysis shows that attention outputs from tokens outside the current block remain largely stable across diffusion steps, while block-internal attention varies significantly. Based on this observation, we propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output, reducing attention computation and KV cache access without modifying the diffusion process. Moreover, FlashBlock is orthogonal to sparse attention and can be combined as a complementary residual reuse strategy, substantially improving model accuracy under aggressive sparsification. Experiments on diffusion language models and video generation demonstrate up to 1.44$\times$ higher token throughput and up to 1.6$\times$ reduction in attention time, with negligible impact on generation quality.

      <title>Wid3R: Wide Field-of-View 3D Reconstruction via Camera Model Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Wid3R, a feed-forward neural network for visual geometry reconstruction that supports wide field-of-view camera models. Prior methods typically assume that input images are rectified or captured with pinhole cameras, since both their architectures and training datasets are tailored to perspective images only. These assumptions limit their applicability in real-world scenarios that use fisheye or panoramic cameras and often require careful calibration and undistortion. In contrast, Wid3R is a generalizable multi-view 3D estimation method that can model wide field-of-view camera types. Our approach leverages a ray representation with spherical harmonics and a novel camera model token within the network, enabling distortion-aware 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, Wid3R is the first multi-view foundation model to support feed-forward 3D reconstruction directly from 360 imagery. It demonstrates strong zero-shot robustness and consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to +77.33 on Stanford2D3D.</description>

      <title>MTPano: Multi-Task Panoramic Scene Understanding via Label-Free Integration of Dense Prediction Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehensive panoramic scene understanding is critical for immersive applications, yet it remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-resolution, multi-task annotations. While perspective foundation models have achieved success through data scaling, directly adapting them to the panoramic domain often fails due to severe geometric distortions and coordinate system discrepancies. Furthermore, the underlying relations between diverse dense prediction tasks in spherical spaces are underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose MTPano, a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model established by a label-free training pipeline. First, to circumvent data scarcity, we leverage powerful perspective dense priors. We project panoramic images into perspective patches to generate accurate, domain-gap-free pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf foundation models, which are then re-projected to serve as patch-wise supervision. Second, to tackle the interference between task types, we categorize tasks into rotation-invariant (e.g., depth, segmentation) and rotation-variant (e.g., surface normals) groups. We introduce the Panoramic Dual BridgeNet, which disentangles these feature streams via geometry-aware modulation layers that inject absolute position and ray direction priors. To handle the distortion from equirectangular projections (ERP), we incorporate ERP token mixers followed by a dual-branch BridgeNet for interactions with gradient truncation, facilitating beneficial cross-task information sharing while blocking conflicting gradients from incompatible task attributes. Additionally, we introduce auxiliary tasks (image gradient, point map, etc.) to fertilize the cross-task learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTPano achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and delivers competitive results against task-specific panoramic specialist foundation models.</description>

      <title>Consistency-Preserving Concept Erasure via Unsafe-Safe Pairing and Directional Fisher-weighted Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing versatility of text-to-image diffusion models, the ability to selectively erase undesirable concepts (e.g., harmful content) has become indispensable. However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs. We first generate safe counterparts from unsafe inputs while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data. Leveraging these pairs, we introduce two key components: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment, a guided objective that uses unsafe-safe pairs to explicitly map target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors; and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA, which initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs, encouraging the generation of safe alternatives while selectively suppressing unsafe concepts. Together, these components enable fine-grained erasure that removes only the targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.</description>

      <title>Learning with Adaptive Prototype Manifolds for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. Existing prototype-based representation learning methods have demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of our method, where APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Latent Reasoning via Hierarchical Visual Cues Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has enabled impressive perception capabilities. However, their reasoning process often remains a "fast thinking" paradigm, reliant on end-to-end generation or explicit, language-centric chains of thought (CoT), which can be inefficient, verbose, and prone to hallucination. This work posits that robust reasoning should evolve within a latent space, integrating multimodal signals seamlessly. We propose multimodal latent reasoning via HIerarchical Visual cuEs injection (\emph{HIVE}), a novel framework that instills deliberate, "slow thinking" without depending on superficial textual rationales. Our method recursively extends transformer blocks, creating an internal loop for iterative reasoning refinement. Crucially, it injectively grounds this process with hierarchical visual cues from global scene context to fine-grained regional details directly into the model's latent representations. This enables the model to perform grounded, multi-step inference entirely in the aligned latent space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that test-time scaling is effective when incorporating vision knowledge, and that integrating hierarchical information significantly enhances the model's understanding of complex scenes.</description>

      <title>Breaking Semantic Hegemony: Decoupling Principal and Residual Subspaces for Generalized OOD Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While feature-based post-hoc methods have made significant strides in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, we uncover a counter-intuitive Simplicity Paradox in existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models: these models exhibit keen sensitivity in distinguishing semantically subtle OOD samples but suffer from severe Geometric Blindness when confronting structurally distinct yet semantically simple samples or high-frequency sensor noise. We attribute this phenomenon to Semantic Hegemony within the deep feature space and reveal its mathematical essence through the lens of Neural Collapse. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the spectral concentration bias, induced by the high variance of the principal subspace, numerically masks the structural distribution shift signals that should be significant in the residual subspace. To address this issue, we propose D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework. This method utilizes orthogonal decomposition to explicitly separate semantic components from structural residuals and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism to reactivate the model's sensitivity to weak residual signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-KNN effectively breaks Semantic Hegemony, establishing new SOTA performance on both CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks. Notably, in resolving the Simplicity Paradox, it reduces the FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3%; when addressing sensor failures such as Gaussian noise, it boosts the detection performance (AUROC) from a baseline of 79.7% to 94.9%.</description>

      <title>Imagine a City: CityGenAgent for Procedural 3D City Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automated generation of interactive 3D cities is a critical challenge with broad applications in autonomous driving, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence. While recent advances in generative models and procedural techniques have improved the realism of city generation, existing methods often struggle with high-fidelity asset creation, controllability, and manipulation. In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program. To ensure structural correctness and semantic alignment, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We train BlockGen and BuildingGen to generate valid programs that adhere to schema constraints, including non-self-intersecting polygons and complete fields; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL). We design Spatial Alignment Reward to enhance spatial reasoning ability and Visual Consistency Reward to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and the visual modality. Benefiting from the programs and the models' generalization, CityGenAgent supports natural language editing and manipulation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability compared to existing methods, establishing a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation.</description>

      <title>SAIL: Self-Amplified Iterative Learning for Diffusion Model Alignment with Minimal Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with human preferences remains challenging, particularly when reward models are unavailable or impractical to obtain, and collecting large-scale preference datasets is prohibitively expensive. \textit{This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve effective alignment using only minimal human feedback, without auxiliary reward models, by unlocking the latent capabilities within diffusion models themselves?} In this paper, we propose \textbf{SAIL} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}mplified \textbf{I}terative \textbf{L}earning), a novel framework that enables diffusion models to act as their own teachers through iterative self-improvement. Starting from a minimal seed set of human-annotated preference pairs, SAIL operates in a closed-loop manner where the model progressively generates diverse samples, self-annotates preferences based on its evolving understanding, and refines itself using this self-augmented dataset. To ensure robust learning and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a ranked preference mixup strategy that carefully balances exploration with adherence to initial human priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using merely 6\% of the preference data required by existing approaches, revealing that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that, when properly harnessed, can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models.</description>

      <title>VRIQ: Benchmarking and Analyzing Visual-Reasoning IQ of VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has raised the question of whether they can reliably perform nonverbal reasoning. To this end, we introduce VRIQ (Visual Reasoning IQ), a novel benchmark designed to assess and analyze the visual reasoning ability of VLMs. We evaluate models on two sets of tasks: abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks. We find that on abstract puzzles, performance remains near random with an average accuracy of around 28%, while natural tasks yield better but still weak results with 45% accuracy. We also find that tool-augmented reasoning demonstrates only modest improvements. To uncover the source of this weakness, we introduce diagnostic probes targeting perception and reasoning. Our analysis demonstrates that around 56% of failures arise from perception alone, 43% from both perception and reasoning, and only a mere 1% from reasoning alone. This motivates us to design fine-grained diagnostic probe questions targeting specific perception categories (e.g., shape, count, position, 3D/depth), revealing that certain categories cause more failures than others. Our benchmark and analysis establish that current VLMs, even with visual reasoning tools, remain unreliable abstract reasoners, mostly due to perception limitations, and offer a principled basis for improving visual reasoning in multimodal systems.</description>

      <title>Dolphin-v2: Universal Document Parsing via Scalable Anchor Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document parsing has garnered widespread attention as vision-language models (VLMs) advance OCR capabilities. However, the field remains fragmented across dozens of specialized models with varying strengths, forcing users to navigate complex model selection and limiting system scalability. Moreover, existing two-stage approaches depend on axis-aligned bounding boxes for layout detection, failing to handle distorted or photographed documents effectively. To this end, we present Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model that substantially improves upon the original Dolphin. In the first stage, Dolphin-v2 jointly performs document type classification (digital-born versus photographed) alongside layout analysis. For digital-born documents, it conducts finer-grained element detection with reading order prediction. In the second stage, we employ a hybrid parsing strategy: photographed documents are parsed holistically as complete pages to handle geometric distortions, while digital-born documents undergo element-wise parallel parsing guided by the detected layout anchors, enabling efficient content extraction. Compared with the original Dolphin, Dolphin-v2 introduces several crucial enhancements: (1) robust parsing of photographed documents via holistic page-level understanding, (2) finer-grained element detection (21 categories) with semantic attribute extraction such as author information and document metadata, and (3) code block recognition with indentation preservation, which existing systems typically lack. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and our self-constructed RealDoc-160 benchmark. The results demonstrate substantial improvements: +14.78 points overall on the challenging OmniDocBench and 91% error reduction on photographed documents, while maintaining efficient inference through parallel processing.</description>

      <title>Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced 3D MRI-to-CT Synthesis for MRI-Only Radiotherapy Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation; however, the absence of electron density information limits its direct use for dose calculation. As a result, current radiotherapy workflows rely on combined MRI and CT acquisitions, increasing registration uncertainty and procedural complexity. Synthetic CT generation enables MRI only planning but remains challenging due to nonlinear MRI-CT relationships and anatomical variability. We propose Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced Med2Transformer, a 3D architecture that integrates convolutional encoding with dual Swin Transformer branches to model both local anatomical detail and long-range contextual dependencies. Multi-scale shifted window attention with hierarchical feature aggregation improves anatomical fidelity. Experiments on public and clinical datasets demonstrate higher image similarity and improved geometric accuracy compared with baseline methods. Dosimetric evaluation shows clinically acceptable performance, with a mean target dose error of 1.69%. Code is available at: https://github.com/mobaidoctor/med2transformer.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distillation via Relative Distribution Matching and Cognitive Heritage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a highly compact dataset that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset on downstream tasks. For the classification task that use pre-trained self-supervised models as backbones, previous linear gradient matching optimizes synthetic images by encouraging them to mimic the gradient updates induced by real images on the linear classifier. However, this batch-level formulation requires loading thousands of real images and applying multiple rounds of differentiable augmentations to synthetic images at each distillation step, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce statistical flow matching , a stable and efficient supervised learning framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data. Our approach loads raw statistics only once and performs a single augmentation pass on the synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime. Furthermore, we propose a classifier inheritance strategy that reuses the classifier trained on the original dataset for inference, requiring only an extremely lightweight linear projector and marginal storage while achieving substantial performance gains.</description>

      <title>Explainable Pathomics Feature Visualization via Correlation-aware Conditional Feature Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathomics is a recent approach that offers rich quantitative features beyond what black-box deep learning can provide, supporting more reproducible and explainable biomarkers in digital pathology. However, many derived features (e.g., "second-order moment") remain difficult to interpret, especially across different clinical contexts, which limits their practical adoption. Conditional diffusion models show promise for explainability through feature editing, but they typically assume feature independence**--**an assumption violated by intrinsically correlated pathomics features. Consequently, editing one feature while fixing others can push the model off the biological manifold and produce unrealistic artifacts. To address this, we propose a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing. Unlike existing approaches, our method regularizes feature trajectories within a disentangled latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder (VAE). This ensures that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells. These optimized features then guide a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity images. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to navigate the manifold of pathomics features when editing those features. The proposed method outperforms baseline methods in conditional feature editing while preserving structural coherence.</description>

      <title>TSBOW: Traffic Surveillance Benchmark for Occluded Vehicles Under Various Weather Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global warming has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which degrade CCTV signal and video quality while disrupting traffic flow, thereby increasing traffic accident rates. Existing datasets, often limited to light haze, rain, and snow, fail to capture extreme weather conditions. To address this gap, this study introduces the Traffic Surveillance Benchmark for Occluded vehicles under various Weather conditions (TSBOW), a comprehensive dataset designed to enhance occluded vehicle detection across diverse annual weather scenarios. Comprising over 32 hours of real-world traffic data from densely populated urban areas, TSBOW includes more than 48,000 manually annotated and 3.2 million semi-labeled frames; bounding boxes spanning eight traffic participant classes from large vehicles to micromobility devices and pedestrians. We establish an object detection benchmark for TSBOW, highlighting challenges posed by occlusions and adverse weather. With its varied road types, scales, and viewpoints, TSBOW serves as a critical resource for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Our findings underscore the potential of CCTV-based traffic monitoring, pave the way for new research and applications. The TSBOW dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/SKKUAutoLab/TSBOW.</description>

      <title>VMF-GOS: Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis for Long-Tailed OOD Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under long-tailed distributions is a highly challenging task because the scarcity of samples in tail classes leads to blurred decision boundaries in the feature space. Current state-of-the-art (sota) methods typically employ Outlier Exposure (OE) strategies, relying on large-scale real external datasets (such as 80 Million Tiny Images) to regularize the feature space. However, this dependence on external data often becomes infeasible in practical deployment due to high data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity. To this end, we propose a novel data-free framework aimed at completely eliminating reliance on external datasets while maintaining superior detection performance. We introduce a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy that models statistical properties using the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hypersphere. Specifically, we locate a low-likelihood annulus in the feature space and perform directional sampling of virtual outliers in this region. Simultaneously, we introduce a new Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) that utilizes contrastive learning to maximize the distinction between in-distribution (ID) features and these synthesized boundary outliers. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms sota approaches that utilize external real images.</description>

      <title>Disco: Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware Collaborative Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate cell instance segmentation is foundational for digital pathology analysis. Existing methods based on contour detection and distance mapping still face significant challenges in processing complex and dense cellular regions. Graph coloring-based methods provide a new paradigm for this task, yet the effectiveness of this paradigm in real-world scenarios with dense overlaps and complex topologies has not been verified. Addressing this issue, we release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025, which contains highly complex and dense sub-cellular nuclear arrangements. We conduct the first systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and reveal an important discovery: most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles (predominantly triangles). This makes simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues, while higher-chromaticity models would cause representational redundancy and optimization difficulties. Building on this observation of complex real-world contexts, we propose Disco (Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware COllaborative Coloring), an adjacency-aware framework based on the "divide and conquer" principle. It uniquely combines a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts. First, "Explicit Marking" strategy transforms the topological challenge into a learnable classification task by recursively decomposing the cell graph and isolating a "conflict set." Second, "Implicit Disambiguation" mechanism resolves ambiguities in conflict regions by enforcing feature dissimilarity between different instances, enabling the model to learn separable feature representations.</description>

      <title>NeVStereo: A NeRF-Driven NVS-Stereo Architecture for High-Fidelity 3D Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern dense 3D reconstruction, feed-forward systems (e.g., VGGT, pi3) focus on end-to-end matching and geometry prediction but do not explicitly output the novel view synthesis (NVS). Neural rendering-based approaches offer high-fidelity NVS and detailed geometry from posed images, yet they typically assume fixed camera poses and can be sensitive to pose errors. As a result, it remains non-trivial to obtain a single framework that can offer accurate poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views. We present NeVStereo, a NeRF-driven NVS-stereo architecture that aims to jointly deliver camera poses, multi-view depth, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB-only inputs. NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage that updates both depth and the radiance field to improve geometric consistency. This design mitigated the common NeRF-based issues such as surface stacking, artifacts, and pose-depth coupling. Across indoor, outdoor, tabletop, and aerial benchmarks, our experiments indicate that NeVStereo achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance, with up to 36% lower depth error, 10.4% improved pose accuracy, 4.5% higher NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality (F1 91.93%, Chamfer 4.35 mm) compared to existing prestigious methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional deep learning models often lack annotated data, especially in cross-domain applications such as anomaly detection, which is critical for early disease diagnosis in medicine and defect detection in industry. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-AD, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for robust unsupervised anomaly detection across medical and industrial images. Our approach employs the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to enhance feature extraction via channel-wise attention, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and detect subtle anomalies. Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers informative features from the teacher to the student model, enabling effective learning of the differences between normal and anomalous data. Then, the discriminator network further enhances the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. At the inference stage, by integrating multi-scale features, the student model can detect anomalies of varying sizes. The teacher-student (T-S) architecture ensures consistent representation of high-dimensional features while adapting them to enhance anomaly detection. Multi-AD was evaluated on several medical datasets, including brain MRI, liver CT, and retina OCT, as well as industrial datasets, such as MVTec AD, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving the best average AUROC for both image-level (81.4% for medical and 99.6% for industrial) and pixel-level (97.0% for medical and 98.4% for industrial) tasks, making it effective for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>LD-SLRO: Latent Diffusion Structured Light for 3-D Reconstruction of Highly Reflective Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry-based 3-D reconstruction of objects with high reflectivity and low surface roughness remains a significant challenge. When measuring such glossy surfaces, specular reflection and indirect illumination often lead to severe distortion or loss of the projected fringe patterns. To address these issues, we propose a latent diffusion-based structured light for reflective objects (LD-SLRO). Phase-shifted fringe images captured from highly reflective surfaces are first encoded to extract latent representations that capture surface reflectance characteristics. These latent features are then used as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model, which probabilistically suppresses reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information, yielding high-quality fringe images. The proposed components, including the specular reflection encoder, time-variant channel affine layer, and attention modules, further improve fringe restoration quality. In addition, LD-SLRO provides high flexibility in configuring the input and output fringe sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves both fringe quality and 3-D reconstruction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, reducing the average root-mean-squared error from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm.</description>

      <title>Stable Velocity: A Variance Perspective on Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity, a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.

      <title>Synthetic Defect Geometries of Cast Metal Objects Modeled via 2d Voronoi Tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In industry, defect detection is crucial for quality control. Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are preferred as they do not influence the functionality of the object while inspecting. Automated data evaluation for automated defect detection is a growing field of research. In particular, machine learning approaches show promising results. To provide training data in sufficient amount and quality, synthetic data can be used. Rule-based approaches enable synthetic data generation in a controllable environment. Therefore, a digital twin of the inspected object including synthetic defects is needed. We present parametric methods to model 3d mesh objects of various defect types that can then be added to the object geometry to obtain synthetic defective objects. The models are motivated by common defects in metal casting but can be transferred to other machining procedures that produce similar defect shapes. Synthetic data resembling the real inspection data can then be created by using a physically based Monte Carlo simulation of the respective testing method. Using our defect models, a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set can be generated with the possibility to include rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity. Pixel-perfect annotation can be created in parallel. As an example, we will use visual surface inspection, but the procedure can be applied in combination with simulations for any other NDT method.</description>

      <title>DisCa: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers with Distillation-Compatible Learnable Feature Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved great success in the field of video generation, this progress is accompanied by a rapidly escalating computational burden. Among the existing acceleration methods, Feature Caching is popular due to its training-free property and considerable speedup performance, but it inevitably faces semantic and detail drop with further compression. Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps. This paper novelly introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for the first time. We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of highly compressed distillation on large-scale video models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation. By undertaking these initiatives, we further push the acceleration boundaries to $11.8\times$ while preserving generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is in the supplementary materials and will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Attention Retention for Continual Learning with Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers AI systems to progressively acquire knowledge from non-stationary data streams. However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.</description>

      <title>MerNav: A Highly Generalizable Memory-Execute-Review Framework for Zero-Shot Object Goal Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is one of the fundamental capabilities for embodied intelligence and a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed. However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of both success rate (SR) and generalization: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches typically achieve higher SR, while Training-Free (TF) approaches often generalize better, but it is difficult to obtain both simultaneously. To this end, we propose a Memory-Execute-Review framework. It consists of three parts: a hierarchical memory module for providing information support, an execute module for routine decision-making and actions, and a review module for handling abnormal situations and correcting behavior. We validated the effectiveness of this framework on the Object Goal Navigation task. Across 4 datasets, our average SR achieved absolute improvements of 7% and 5% compared to all baseline methods under TF and Zero-Shot (ZS) settings, respectively. On the most commonly used HM3D_v0.1 and the more challenging open vocabulary dataset HM3D_OVON, the SR improved by 8% and 6%, under ZS settings. Furthermore, on the MP3D and HM3D_OVON datasets, our method not only outperformed all TF methods but also surpassed all SFT methods, achieving comprehensive leadership in both SR (5% and 2%) and generalization.</description>

      <title>SOMA-1M: A Large-Scale SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment Dataset for Multi-Task Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery provide complementary strengths that constitute the critical foundation for transcending single-modality constraints and facilitating cross-modal collaborative processing and intelligent interpretation. However, existing benchmark datasets often suffer from limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy, making them inadequate for supporting the training and generalization of multi-scale foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce SOMA-1M (SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment), a pixel-level precisely aligned dataset containing over 1.3 million pairs of georeferenced images with a specification of 512 x 512 pixels. This dataset integrates imagery from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth, achieving global multi-scale coverage from 0.5 m to 10 m. It encompasses 12 typical land cover categories, effectively ensuring scene diversity and complexity. To address multimodal projection deformation and massive data registration, we designed a rigorous coarse-to-fine image matching framework ensuring pixel-level alignment. Based on this dataset, we established comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for four hierarchical vision tasks, including image matching, image fusion, SAR-assisted cloud removal, and cross-modal translation, involving over 30 mainstream algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks. Notably, multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching performance achieves current state-of-the-art (SOTA) levels. SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models. The dataset will be released publicly at: https://github.com/PeihaoWu/SOMA-1M.</description>

      <title>Feature points evaluation on omnidirectional vision with a photorealistic fisheye sequence -- A report on experiments done in 2014</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is this report: This is a scientific report, contributing with a detailed bibliography, a dataset which we will call now PFSeq for ''Photorealistic Fisheye Sequence'' and make available at https://doi.org/10. 57745/DYIVVU, and comprehensive experiments. This work should be considered as a draft, and has been done during my PhD thesis ''Construction of 3D models from fisheye video data-Application to the localisation in urban area'' in 2014 [Mor16]. These results have never been published. The aim was to find the best features detector and descriptor for fisheye images, in the context of selfcalibration, with cameras mounted on the top of a car and aiming at the zenith (to proceed then fisheye visual odometry and stereovision in urban scenes). We face a chicken and egg problem, because we can not take advantage of an accurate projection model for an optimal features detection and description, and we rightly need good features to perform the calibration (i.e. to compute the accurate projection model of the camera). What is not this report: It does not contribute with new features algorithm. It does not compare standard features algorithms to algorithms designed for omnidirectional images (unfortunately). It has not been peer-reviewed. Discussions have been translated and enhanced but the experiments have not been run again and the report has not been updated accordingly to the evolution of the state-of-the-art (read this as a 2014 report).</description>

      <title>VGGT-Motion: Motion-Aware Calibration-Free Monocular SLAM for Long-Range Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in calibration-free monocular SLAM via 3D vision foundation models, scale drift remains severe on long sequences. Motion-agnostic partitioning breaks contextual coherence and causes zero-motion drift, while conventional geometric alignment is computationally expensive. To address these issues, we propose VGGT-Motion, a calibration-free SLAM system for efficient and robust global consistency over kilometer-scale trajectories. Specifically, we first propose a motion-aware submap construction mechanism that uses optical flow to guide adaptive partitioning, prune static redundancy, and encapsulate turns for stable local geometry. We then design an anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy. By exploiting context-balanced anchors, it achieves search-free, pixel-wise dense alignment and efficient loop closure without costly feature matching. Finally, a lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization enforces global consistency with linear complexity, enabling scalable long-range operation. Experiments show that VGGT-Motion markedly improves trajectory accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, long-range calibration-free monocular SLAM.</description>

      <title>Mapper-GIN: Lightweight Structural Graph Abstraction for Corrupted 3D Point Cloud Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust 3D point cloud classification is often pursued by scaling up backbones or relying on specialized data augmentation. We instead ask whether structural abstraction alone can improve robustness, and study a simple topology-inspired decomposition based on the Mapper algorithm. We propose Mapper-GIN, a lightweight pipeline that partitions a point cloud into overlapping regions using Mapper (PCA lens, cubical cover, and followed by density-based clustering), constructs a region graph from their overlaps, and performs graph classification with a Graph Isomorphism Network. On the corruption benchmark ModelNet40-C, Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters. In contrast to prior approaches that require heavier architectures or additional mechanisms to gain robustness, Mapper-GIN attains strong corruption robustness through simple region-level graph abstraction and GIN message passing. Overall, our results suggest that region-graph structure offers an efficient and interpretable source of robustness for 3D visual recognition.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Self-Supervised Vision Transformers for Protein Localization Across Microscopy Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-specific microscopy datasets are often too small to train deep learning models that learn robust feature representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can mitigate this by pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, but it remains unclear how well such representations transfer across microscopy domains with different staining protocols and channel configurations. We investigate the cross-domain transferability of DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers for protein localization on the OpenCell dataset. We generate image embeddings using three DINO backbones pretrained on ImageNet-1k, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and OpenCell, and evaluate them by training a supervised classification head on OpenCell labels. All pretrained models transfer well, with the microscopy-specific HPA-pretrained model achieving the best performance (mean macro $F_1$-score = 0.8221 \pm 0.0062), slightly outperforming a DINO model trained directly on OpenCell (0.8057 \pm 0.0090). These results highlight the value of large-scale pretraining and indicate that domain-relevant SSL representations can generalize effectively to related but distinct microscopy datasets, enabling strong downstream performance even when task-specific labeled data are limited.</description>

      <title>SSG: Scaled Spatial Guidance for Multi-Scale Visual Autoregressive Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) models generate images through next-scale prediction, naturally achieving coarse-to-fine, fast, high-fidelity synthesis mirroring human perception. In practice, this hierarchy can drift at inference time, as limited capacity and accumulated error cause the model to deviate from its coarse-to-fine nature. We revisit this limitation from an information-theoretic perspective and deduce that ensuring each scale contributes high-frequency content not explained by earlier scales mitigates the train-inference discrepancy. With this insight, we propose Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence. SSG emphasizes target high-frequency signals, defined as the semantic residual, isolated from a coarser prior. To obtain this prior, we leverage a principled frequency-domain procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), which is devised to sharpen and better isolate the semantic residual through frequency-aware construction. SSG applies broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality. Experiments demonstrate SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

      <title>A Comparative Study of 3D Person Detection: Sensor Modalities and Robustness in Diverse Indoor and Outdoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D person detection is critical for safety in applications such as robotics, industrial monitoring, and surveillance. This work presents a systematic evaluation of 3D person detection using camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. While most existing research focuses on autonomous driving, we explore detection performance and robustness in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes using the JRDB dataset. We compare three representative models - BEVDepth (camera), PointPillars (LiDAR), and DAL (camera-LiDAR fusion) - and analyze their behavior under varying occlusion and distance levels. Our results show that the fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, particularly in challenging scenarios. We further investigate robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments, revealing that while DAL offers improved resilience, it remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and certain LiDAR-based corruptions. In contrast, the camera-based BEVDepth model showed the lowest performance and was most affected by occlusion, distance, and noise. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing sensor fusion for enhanced 3D person detection, while also underscoring the need for ongoing research to address the vulnerabilities inherent in these systems.</description>

      <title>FastVMT: Eliminating Redundancy in Video Motion Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video motion transfer aims to synthesize videos by generating visual content according to a text prompt while transferring the motion pattern observed in a reference video. Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.</description>

      <title>IndustryShapes: An RGB-D Benchmark dataset for 6D object pose estimation of industrial assembly components and tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce IndustryShapes, a new RGB-D benchmark dataset of industrial tools and components, designed for both instance-level and novel object 6D pose estimation approaches. The dataset provides a realistic and application-relevant testbed for benchmarking these methods in the context of industrial robotics bridging the gap between lab-based research and deployment in real-world manufacturing scenarios. Unlike many previous datasets that focus on household or consumer products or use synthetic, clean tabletop datasets, or objects captured solely in controlled lab environments, IndustryShapes introduces five new object types with challenging properties, also captured in realistic industrial assembly settings. The dataset has diverse complexity, from simple to more challenging scenes, with single and multiple objects, including scenes with multiple instances of the same object and it is organized in two parts: the classic set and the extended set. The classic set includes a total of 4,6k images and 6k annotated poses. The extended set introduces additional data modalities to support the evaluation of model-free and sequence-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, IndustryShapes is the first dataset to offer RGB-D static onboarding sequences. We further evaluate the dataset on a representative set of state-of-the art methods for instance-based and novel object 6D pose estimation, including also object detection, segmentation, showing that there is room for improvement in this domain. The dataset page can be found in https://pose-lab.github.io/IndustryShapes.</description>

      <title>PIRATR: Parametric Object Inference for Robotic Applications with Transformers in 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PIRATR, an end-to-end 3D object detection framework for robotic use cases in point clouds. Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adjusted according to simple, predefined rules. The architecture employs modular, class-specific heads, making it straightforward to extend to novel object types without re-designing the pipeline. We validate PIRATR on an automated forklift platform, focusing on three structurally and functionally diverse categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in a synthetic environment, PIRATR generalizes effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919 without additional fine-tuning. PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception. This bridges the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models, paving the way for scalable, simulation-trained perception systems that can be deployed in dynamic robotic environments.

      <title>ShapeGaussian: High-Fidelity 4D Human Reconstruction in Monocular Videos via Vision Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ShapeGaussian, a high-fidelity, template-free method for 4D human reconstruction from casual monocular videos. Generic reconstruction methods lacking robust vision priors, such as 4DGS, struggle to capture high-deformation human motion without multi-view cues. While template-based approaches, primarily relying on SMPL, such as HUGS, can produce photorealistic results, they are highly susceptible to errors in human pose estimation, often leading to unrealistic artifacts. In contrast, ShapeGaussian effectively integrates template-free vision priors to achieve both high-fidelity and robust scene reconstructions. Our method follows a two-step pipeline: first, we learn a coarse, deformable geometry using pretrained models that estimate data-driven priors, providing a foundation for reconstruction. Then, we refine this geometry using a neural deformation model to capture fine-grained dynamic details. By leveraging 2D vision priors, we mitigate artifacts from erroneous pose estimation in template-based methods and employ multiple reference frames to resolve the invisibility issue of 2D keypoints in a template-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShapeGaussian surpasses template-based methods in reconstruction accuracy, achieving superior visual quality and robustness across diverse human motions in casual monocular videos.</description>

      <title>Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer (ViGT), an autonomous driving geometric model that estimates continuous 3D occupancy fields from surround-view camera rigs. ViGT represents a step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, prioritizing scalability, architectural simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations. Our approach achieves this through a calibration-free architecture, enabling a single model to adapt to different sensor setups. Unlike general-purpose geometric foundational models that focus on pixel-aligned predictions, ViGT estimates a continuous 3D occupancy field in a birds-eye-view (BEV) addressing domain-specific requirements. ViGT naturally infers geometry from multiple camera views into a single metric coordinate frame, providing a common representation for multiple geometric tasks. Unlike most existing occupancy models, we adopt a self-supervised training procedure that leverages synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, eliminating the need for costly manual annotations. We validate the scalability and generalizability of our approach by training our model on a mixture of five large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NuScenes, Waymo, NuPlan, ONCE, and Argoverse) and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the pointmap estimation task, with the best average rank across all evaluated baselines. We further evaluate ViGT on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, where ViGT achieves comparable performance with supervised methods.

      <title>A Hybrid CNN and ML Framework for Multi-modal Classification of Movement Disorders Using MRI and Brain Structural Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders (APD), also known as Parkinson-plus syndrome, are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In the early stages, overlapping clinical features often lead to misdiagnosis as Parkinson's disease (PD). Identifying reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis remains a critical challenge. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning (ML) techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between the subtypes themselves: PSP vs. PD, MSA vs. PD, and PSP vs. MSA. The model leverages multi-modal input data, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures associated with APD, and their corresponding volumetric measurements. By integrating these complementary modalities, including image data, structural segmentation masks, and quantitative volume features, the hybrid approach achieved promising classification performance with area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA. These results highlight the potential of combining spatial and structural information for robust subtype differentiation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs improves classification accuracy for APD subtypes. The proposed approach may contribute to more reliable early-stage diagnosis, facilitating timely and targeted interventions in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>LocateEdit-Bench: A Benchmark for Instruction-Based Editing Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image editing have enabled highly controllable and semantically-aware alteration of visual content, posing unprecedented challenges to manipulation localization. However, existing AI-generated forgery localization methods primarily focus on inpainting-based manipulations, making them ineffective against the latest instruction-based editing paradigms. To bridge this critical gap, we propose LocateEdit-Bench, a large-scale dataset comprising $231$K edited images, designed specifically to benchmark localization methods against instruction-driven image editing. Our dataset incorporates four cutting-edge editing models and covers three common edit types. We conduct a detailed analysis of the dataset and develop two multi-metric evaluation protocols to assess existing localization methods. Our work establishes a foundation to keep pace with the evolving landscape of image editing, thereby facilitating the development of effective methods for future forgery localization. Dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>LoGoSeg: Integrating Local and Global Features for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) extends traditional closed-set segmentation by enabling pixel-wise annotation for both seen and unseen categories using arbitrary textual descriptions. While existing methods leverage vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, their reliance on image-level pretraining often results in imprecise spatial alignment, leading to mismatched segmentations in ambiguous or cluttered scenes. However, most existing approaches lack strong object priors and region-level constraints, which can lead to object hallucination or missed detections, further degrading performance. To address these challenges, we propose LoGoSeg, an efficient single-stage framework that integrates three key innovations: (i) an object existence prior that dynamically weights relevant categories through global image-text similarity, effectively reducing hallucinations; (ii) a region-aware alignment module that establishes precise region-level visual-textual correspondences; and (iii) a dual-stream fusion mechanism that optimally combines local structural information with global semantic context. Unlike prior works, LoGoSeg eliminates the need for external mask proposals, additional backbones, or extra datasets, ensuring efficiency. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks (A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, PAS-20, and PAS-20b) demonstrate its competitive performance and strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.</description>

      <title>Geometric Observability Index: An Operator-Theoretic Framework for Per-Feature Sensitivity, Weak Observability, and Dynamic Effects in SE(3) Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on the Lie group SE(3). Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3).
  The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace. GOI admits a spectral decomposition along the principal directions of the observable curvature, revealing a direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In the population regime, GOI coincides with the Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding a single-measurement analogue of the Cramer-Rao bound.
  The same spectral mechanism explains classical degeneracies such as pure rotation and vanishing parallax, as well as dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions. Overall, GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator. Because these quantities arise directly within Gauss-Newton pipelines, the curvature spectrum and GOI also yield lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures.</description>

      <title>A Mixed Reality System for Robust Manikin Localization in Childbirth Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opportunities for medical students to gain practical experience in vaginal births are increasingly constrained by shortened clinical rotations, patient reluctance, and the unpredictable nature of labour. To alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency, we introduce a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training that combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, thereby preserving authentic haptic feedback while enabling independent practice without continuous on-site expert supervision. The system extends the passthrough capability of commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs) by spatially calibrating an external RGB-D camera, allowing real-time visual integration of physical training objects. Building on this capability, we implement a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline that first aligns the maternal manikin with fiducial markers to define a delivery region and then registers the pre-scanned neonatal head within this area. This process enables spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands near the manikin, allowing trainees to follow expert trajectories reinforced by haptic interaction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves accurate and stable manikin localization on a standalone headset, ensuring practical deployment without external computing resources. A large-scale user study involving 83 fourth-year medical students was subsequently conducted to compare MR-based and virtual reality (VR)-based childbirth training. Four senior obstetricians independently assessed performance using standardized criteria. Results showed that MR training achieved significantly higher scores in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance, and was consistently preferred by trainees over VR training.</description>

      <title>EgoPoseVR: Spatiotemporal Multi-Modal Reasoning for Egocentric Full-Body Pose in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications demand accurate, temporally coherent full-body pose tracking. Recent head-mounted camera-based approaches show promise in egocentric pose estimation, but encounter challenges when applied to VR head-mounted displays (HMDs), including temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and the lack of real-time performance. To address these limitations, we present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline. A spatiotemporal encoder extracts frame- and joint-level representations, which are fused via cross-attention to fully exploit complementary motion cues across modalities. A kinematic optimization module then imposes constraints from HMD signals, enhancing the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1.8 million temporally aligned HMD and RGB-D frames across diverse VR scenarios. Experimental results show that EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models. A user study in real-world scenes further shows that EgoPoseVR achieved significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baseline methods. These results show that EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems.</description>

      <title>CAViT -- Channel-Aware Vision Transformer for Dynamic Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a range of computer vision tasks by modeling long-range spatial interactions via self-attention. However, channel-wise mixing in ViTs remains static, relying on fixed multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that lack adaptability to input content. We introduce 'CAViT', a dual-attention architecture that replaces the static MLP with a dynamic, attention-based mechanism for feature interaction. Each Transformer block in CAViT performs spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention, allowing the model to dynamically recalibrate feature representations based on global image context. This unified and content-aware token mixing strategy enhances representational expressiveness without increasing depth or complexity. We validate CAViT across five benchmark datasets spanning both natural and medical domains, where it outperforms the standard ViT baseline by up to +3.6% in accuracy, while reducing parameter count and FLOPs by over 30%. Qualitative attention maps reveal sharper and semantically meaningful activation patterns, validating the effectiveness of our attention-driven token mixing.</description>

      <title>Multi-instance robust fitting for non-classical geometric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing robust fitting methods are designed for classical models, such as lines, circles, and planes. In contrast, fewer methods have been developed to robustly handle non-classical models, such as spiral curves, procedural character models, and free-form surfaces. Furthermore, existing methods primarily focus on reconstructing a single instance of a non-classical model. This paper aims to reconstruct multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data. We formulate this multi-instance fitting task as an optimization problem, which comprises an estimator and an optimizer. Specifically, we propose a novel estimator based on the model-to-data error, capable of handling outliers without a predefined error threshold. Since the proposed estimator is non-differentiable with respect to the model parameters, we employ a meta-heuristic algorithm as the optimizer to seek the global optimum. The effectiveness of our method are demonstrated through experimental results on various non-classical models. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangzongliang/fitting.</description>

      <title>Unified Sensor Simulation for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce \textbf{XSIM}, a sensor simulation framework for autonomous driving. XSIM extends 3DGUT splatting with a generalized rolling-shutter modeling tailored for autonomous driving applications. Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet.

      <title>ROMAN: Reward-Orchestrated Multi-Head Attention Network for Autonomous Driving System Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Driving System (ADS) acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles, responsible for their safety and efficiency. Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.</description>

      <title>UniSurg: A Video-Native Foundation Model for Universal Understanding of Surgical Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While foundation models have advanced surgical video analysis, current approaches rely predominantly on pixel-level reconstruction objectives that waste model capacity on low-level visual details - such as smoke, specular reflections, and fluid motion - rather than semantic structures essential for surgical understanding. We present UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that shifts the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction. Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation. These results establish UniSurg as a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Personality Recognition by Comparing the Predictive Power of Traits, Facets, and Nuances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personality is a complex, hierarchical construct typically assessed through item-level questionnaires aggregated into broad trait scores. Personality recognition models aim to infer personality traits from different sources of behavioral data. However, reliance on broad trait scores as ground truth, combined with limited training data, poses challenges for generalization, as similar trait scores can manifest through diverse, context dependent behaviors. In this work, we explore the predictive impact of the more granular hierarchical levels of the Big-Five Personality Model, facets and nuances, to enhance personality recognition from audiovisual interaction data. Using the UDIVA v0.5 dataset, we trained a transformer-based model including cross-modal (audiovisual) and cross-subject (dyad-aware) attention mechanisms. Results show that nuance-level models consistently outperform facet and trait-level models, reducing mean squared error by up to 74% across interaction scenarios.</description>

      <title>ShapeUP: Scalable Image-Conditioned 3D Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D foundation models have enabled the generation of high-fidelity assets, yet precise 3D manipulation remains a significant challenge. Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This image-as-prompt approach enables fine-grained visual control over both local and global edits and achieves implicit, mask-free localization, while maintaining strict structural consistency with the original asset. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ShapeUP consistently outperforms current trained and training-free baselines in both identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.</description>

      <title>Poster: Camera Tampering Detection for Outdoor IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the use of smart cameras in outdoor settings has grown to improve surveillance and security. Nonetheless, these systems are susceptible to tampering, whether from deliberate vandalism or harsh environmental conditions, which can undermine their monitoring effectiveness. In this context, detecting camera tampering is more challenging when a camera is capturing still images rather than video as there is no sequence of continuous frames over time. In this study, we propose two approaches for detecting tampered images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The aim is to evaluate how each method performs in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and the data required for training when applied to real-world scenarios. Our results show that the deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more appropriate for scenarios where resources are limited and a prolonged calibration phase is impractical. We also offer publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images to support the development and evaluation of camera tampering detection methods, addressing the need for such resources.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Temporal Consistency for Point-Level Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PTAL) adopts a lightly frame-annotated paradigm (\textit{i.e.}, labeling only a single frame per action instance) to train a model to effectively locate action instances within untrimmed videos. Most existing approaches design the task head of models with only a point-supervised snippet-level classification, without explicit modeling of understanding temporal relationships among frames of an action. However, understanding the temporal relationships of frames is crucial because it can help a model understand how an action is defined and therefore benefits localizing the full frames of an action. To this end, in this paper, we design a multi-task learning framework that fully utilizes point supervision to boost the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization. Specifically, we design three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: (i) Action Completion, (ii) Action Order Understanding, and (iii) Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks help a model understand the temporal consistency of actions across videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly explore temporal consistency for point supervision action localization. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Global and Fine-Grained Perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings Compatible with Hard Negative Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal embeddings serve as a bridge for aligning vision and language, with the two primary implementations -- CLIP-based and MLLM-based embedding models -- both limited to capturing only global semantic information. Although numerous studies have focused on fine-grained understanding, we observe that complex scenarios currently targeted by MLLM embeddings often involve a hybrid perceptual pattern of both global and fine-grained elements, thus necessitating a compatible fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method that prompts the MLLM to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. Furthermore, we adapt AGFF-Embed with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique to achieve in-batch hard negatives enhancement without requiring fine-grained editing of the dataset. Evaluation on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks shows that AGFF-Embed comprehensively achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding compared to other multimodal embedding models.</description>

      <title>Depth as Prior Knowledge for Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting small and distant objects remains challenging for object detectors due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects for safe planning. Depth information can improve detection, but existing approaches require complex, model-specific architectural modifications. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by an empirical investigation of the depth-detection relationship. Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections). DepthPrior offers these benefits without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs. Code is available at https://github.com/mos-ks/DepthPrior.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Inspired Visual Pattern Recognition via Biological Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a neuro-inspired approach to reservoir computing (RC) in which a network of in vitro cultured cortical neurons serves as the physical reservoir. Rather than relying on artificial recurrent models to approximate neural dynamics, our biological reservoir computing (BRC) system leverages the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity of living neural circuits as its computational substrate. A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) provides simultaneous stimulation and readout across hundreds of channels: input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting high-dimensional neural responses, yielding a biologically grounded feature representation. A linear readout layer (single-layer perceptron) is then trained to classify these reservoir states, enabling the living neural network to perform static visual pattern-recognition tasks within a computer-vision framework. We evaluate the system across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from pointwise stimuli to oriented bars, clock-digit-like shapes, and handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Despite the inherent variability of biological neural responses-arising from noise, spontaneous activity, and inter-session differences-the system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification. These results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks. More broadly, this work contributes to the effort to incorporate biological principles into machine learning and supports the goals of neuro-inspired vision by illustrating how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically grounded computational models.</description>

      <title>FMPose3D: monocular 3D pose estimation via flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is fundamentally ill-posed due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, thereby motivating probabilistic methods that generate multiple plausible 3D pose hypotheses. In particular, diffusion-based models have recently demonstrated strong performance, but their iterative denoising process typically requires many timesteps for each prediction, making inference computationally expensive. In contrast, we leverage Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), enabling efficient generation of 3D pose samples with only a few integration steps. We propose a novel generative pose estimation framework, FMPose3D, that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem. It continuously transports samples from a standard Gaussian prior to the distribution of plausible 3D poses conditioned only on 2D inputs. Although ODE trajectories are deterministic, FMPose3D naturally generates various pose hypotheses by sampling different noise seeds. To obtain a single accurate prediction from those hypotheses, we further introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module, which approximates the Bayesian posterior expectation over 3D hypotheses. FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on the widely used human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and further achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, demonstrating strong performance across both 3D pose domains.

      <title>ReText: Text Boosts Generalization in Image-Based Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizable image-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across cameras in unseen domains without retraining. While multiple existing approaches address the domain gap through complex architectures, recent findings indicate that better generalization can be achieved by stylistically diverse single-camera data. Although this data is easy to collect, it lacks complexity due to minimal cross-view variation. We propose ReText, a novel method trained on a mixture of multi-camera Re-ID data and single-camera data, where the latter is complemented by textual descriptions to enrich semantic cues. During training, ReText jointly optimizes three tasks: (1) Re-ID on multi-camera data, (2) image-text matching, and (3) image reconstruction guided by text on single-camera data. Experiments demonstrate that ReText achieves strong generalization and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore multimodal joint learning on a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data in image-based person Re-ID.</description>

      <title>Allocentric Perceiver: Disentangling Allocentric Reasoning from Egocentric Visual Priors via Frame Instantiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rising need for spatially grounded tasks such as Vision-Language Navigation/Action, allocentric perception capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are receiving growing focus. However, VLMs remain brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, where the answer depends on reasoning in a target-centric frame rather than the observed camera view. Thus, we introduce Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that recovers metric 3D states from one or more images with off-the-shelf geometric experts, and then instantiates a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame aligned with the instruction's semantic intent. By deterministically transforming reconstructed geometry into the target frame and prompting the backbone VLM with structured, geometry-grounded representations, Allocentric Perceriver offloads mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation. We evaluate Allocentric Perciver across multiple backbone families on spatial reasoning benchmarks, observing consistent and substantial gains ($\sim$10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, and surpassing both spatial-perception-finetuned models and state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models.</description>

      <title>Focus-Scan-Refine: From Human Visual Perception to Efficient Visual Token Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often generate massive visual tokens that greatly increase inference latency and memory footprint; while training-free token pruning offers a practical remedy, existing methods still struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression. We propose Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, then scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context by aggregating relevant details. FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens that are most different from the focused evidence. Finally, FSR refines the scanned context by aggregating nearby informative tokens into the scan anchors via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging, without increasing the token budget. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show that FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

      <title>NVS-HO: A Benchmark for Novel View Synthesis of Handheld Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose NVS-HO, the first benchmark designed for novel view synthesis of handheld objects in real-world environments using only RGB inputs. Each object is recorded in two complementary RGB sequences: (1) a handheld sequence, where the object is manipulated in front of a static camera, and (2) a board sequence, where the object is fixed on a ChArUco board to provide accurate camera poses via marker detection. The goal of NVS-HO is to learn a NVS model that captures the full appearance of an object from (1), whereas (2) provides the ground-truth images used for evaluation. To establish baselines, we consider both a classical SfM pipeline and a state-of-the-art pre-trained feed-forward neural network (VGGT) as pose estimators, and train NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments reveal significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions, highlighting the need for more robust approaches. NVS-HO thus offers a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects.</description>

      <title>Sparse Video Generation Propels Real-World Beyond-the-View Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.</description>

      <title>Weaver: End-to-End Agentic System Training for Video Interleaved Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video reasoning constitutes a comprehensive assessment of a model's capabilities, as it demands robust perceptual and interpretive skills, thereby serving as a means to explore the boundaries of model performance. While recent research has leveraged text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning to augment these capabilities, such approaches frequently suffer from representational mismatch and restricted by limited perceptual acuity. To address these limitations, we propose Weaver, a novel, end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system. Weaver empowers its policy model to dynamically invoke diverse tools throughout the reasoning process, enabling progressive acquisition of crucial visual cues and construction of authentic multimodal reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, we integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to allow the system to freely explore strategies for employing and combining these tools with trajectory-free data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Weaver, enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.</description>

      <title>UI-Mem: Self-Evolving Experience Memory for Online Reinforcement Learning in Mobile GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising paradigm for enhancing GUI agents through direct environment interaction. However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning with a Multi-Task Latent Space Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on Siamese networks learn visual representations by aligning different views of the same image. The multi-crop strategy, which incorporates small local crops to global ones, enhances many SSL frameworks but causes instability in predictor-based architectures such as BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3. We trace this failure to the shared predictor used across all views and demonstrate that assigning a separate predictor to each view type stabilizes multi-crop training, resulting in significant performance gains. Extending this idea, we treat each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task and add cutout views, where part of the image is masked before encoding. This yields a simple multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese SSL that combines global, local, and masked views into a single framework. The approach is stable, generally applicable across backbones, and consistently improves the performance of ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Test-Time Correction for Autoregressive Long Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distilled autoregressive diffusion models facilitate real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Contour Refinement using Discrete Diffusion in Low Data Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary detection of irregular and translucent objects is an important problem with applications in medical imaging, environmental monitoring and manufacturing, where many of these applications are plagued with scarce labeled data and low in situ computational resources. While recent image segmentation studies focus on segmentation mask alignment with ground-truth, the task of boundary detection remains understudied, especially in the low data regime. In this work, we present a lightweight discrete diffusion contour refinement pipeline for robust boundary detection in the low data regime. We use a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) architecture with self-attention layers as the core of our pipeline, and condition on a segmentation mask, iteratively denoising a sparse contour representation. We introduce multiple novel adaptations for improved low-data efficacy and inference efficiency, including using a simplified diffusion process, a customized model architecture, and minimal post processing to produce a dense, isolated contour given a dataset of size &lt;500 training images. Our method outperforms several SOTA baselines on the medical imaging dataset KVASIR, is competitive on HAM10K and our custom wildfire dataset, Smoke, while improving inference framerate by 3.5X.</description>

      <title>EoCD: Encoder only Remote Sensing Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being a cornerstone of temporal analysis, change detection has been playing a pivotal role in modern earth observation. Existing change detection methods rely on the Siamese encoder to individually extract temporal features followed by temporal fusion. Subsequently, these methods design sophisticated decoders to improve the change detection performance without taking into consideration the complexity of the model. These aforementioned issues intensify the overall computational cost as well as the network's complexity which is undesirable. Alternatively, few methods utilize the early fusion scheme to combine the temporal images. These methods prevent the extra overhead of Siamese encoder, however, they also rely on sophisticated decoders for better performance. In addition, these methods demonstrate inferior performance as compared to late fusion based methods. To bridge these gaps, we introduce encoder only change detection (EoCD) that is a simple and effective method for the change detection task. The proposed method performs the early fusion of the temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module thereby significantly reducing the overall complexity of the model. EoCD demonstrate the optimal balance between the change detection performance and the prediction speed across a variety of encoder architectures. Additionally, EoCD demonstrate that the performance of the model is predominantly dependent on the encoder network, making the decoder an additional component. Extensive experimentation on four challenging change detection datasets reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Neural Implicit 3D Cardiac Shape Reconstruction from Sparse CT Angiography Slices Mimicking 2D Transthoracic Echocardiography Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D representations of cardiac structures allow quantitative analysis of anatomy and function. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing complete 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of sparse planes in CT angiography (CTA) for application in 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Our method uses a neural implicit function to reconstruct the 3D shape of the cardiac chambers and left-ventricle myocardium from sparse CTA planes. To investigate the feasibility of achieving 3D reconstruction from 2D TTE, we select planes that mimic the standard apical 2D TTE views. During training, a multi-layer perceptron learns shape priors from 3D segmentations of the target structures in CTA. At test time, the network reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of TTE-mimicking CTA planes by jointly optimizing the latent code and the rigid transforms that map the observed planes into 3D space. For each heart, we simulate four realistic apical views, and we compare reconstructed multi-class volumes with the reference CTA volumes. On a held-out set of CTA segmentations, our approach achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 $\pm$ 0.04 across all structures. Our method also achieves markedly lower volume errors than the clinical standard, Simpson's biplane rule: 4.88 $\pm$ 4.26 mL vs. 8.14 $\pm$ 6.04 mL, respectively, for the left ventricle; and 6.40 $\pm$ 7.37 mL vs. 37.76 $\pm$ 22.96 mL, respectively, for the left atrium. This suggests that our approach offers a viable route to more accurate 3D chamber quantification in 2D transthoracic echocardiography.</description>

      <title>CLIP-Map: Structured Matrix Mapping for Parameter-Efficient CLIP Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved widely applications in various computer vision tasks, e.g., text-to-image generation, Image-Text retrieval and Image captioning. However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning for Continual Test-time Adaptation in Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution shift is a common challenge in medical images obtained from different clinical centers, significantly hindering the deployment of pre-trained semantic segmentation models in real-world applications across multiple domains. Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.</description>

      <title>Better Source, Better Flow: Learning Condition-Dependent Source Distribution for Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, particularly for text-to-image generation. Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating conditioning into the source, including distributional collapse and instability, and show that appropriate variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target are critical for stable and effective learning. We further analyze how the choice of target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources, revealing regimes in which such designs are most effective. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate consistent and robust improvements, including up to a 3x faster convergence in FID, highlighting the practical benefits of a principled source distribution design for conditional flow matching.</description>

      <title>LSA: Localized Semantic Alignment for Enhancing Temporal Consistency in Traffic Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable video generation has emerged as a versatile tool for autonomous driving, enabling realistic synthesis of traffic scenarios. However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.</description>

      <title>RISE-Video: Can Video Generators Decode Implicit World Rules?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While generative video models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, their capacity to internalize and reason over implicit world rules remains a critical yet under-explored frontier. To bridge this gap, we present RISE-Video, a pioneering reasoning-oriented benchmark for Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis that shifts the evaluative focus from surface-level aesthetics to deep cognitive reasoning. RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains. Our framework introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol consisting of four metrics: \textit{Reasoning Alignment}, \textit{Temporal Consistency}, \textit{Physical Rationality}, and \textit{Visual Quality}. To further support scalable evaluation, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to emulate human-centric assessment. Extensive experiments on 11 state-of-the-art TI2V models reveal pervasive deficiencies in simulating complex scenarios under implicit constraints, offering critical insights for the advancement of future world-simulating generative models.</description>

      <title>VisRefiner: Learning from Visual Differences for Screenshot-to-Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Screenshot-to-code generation aims to translate user interface screenshots into executable frontend code that faithfully reproduces the target layout and style. Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.</description>

      <title>GenArena: How Can We Achieve Human-Aligned Evaluation for Visual Generation Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of visual generation models has outpaced traditional evaluation approaches, necessitating the adoption of Vision-Language Models as surrogate judges. In this work, we systematically investigate the reliability of the prevailing absolute pointwise scoring standard, across a wide spectrum of visual generation tasks. Our analysis reveals that this paradigm is limited due to stochastic inconsistency and poor alignment with human perception. To resolve these limitations, we introduce GenArena, a unified evaluation framework that leverages a pairwise comparison paradigm to ensure stable and human-aligned evaluation. Crucially, our experiments uncover a transformative finding that simply adopting this pairwise protocol enables off-the-shelf open-source models to outperform top-tier proprietary models. Notably, our method boosts evaluation accuracy by over 20% and achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.86 with the authoritative LMArena leaderboard, drastically surpassing the 0.36 correlation of pointwise methods. Based on GenArena, we benchmark state-of-the-art visual generation models across diverse tasks, providing the community with a rigorous and automated evaluation standard for visual generation.</description>

      <title>MambaVF: State Space Model for Efficient Video Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video fusion is a fundamental technique in various video processing tasks. However, existing video fusion methods heavily rely on optical flow estimation and feature warping, resulting in severe computational overhead and limited scalability. This paper presents MambaVF, an efficient video fusion framework based on state space models (SSMs) that performs temporal modeling without explicit motion estimation. First, by reformulating video fusion as a sequential state update process, MambaVF captures long-range temporal dependencies with linear complexity while significantly reducing computation and memory costs. Second, MambaVF proposes a lightweight SSM-based fusion module that replaces conventional flow-guided alignment via a spatio-temporal bidirectional scanning mechanism. This module enables efficient information aggregation across frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our MambaVF achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared-visible, and medical video fusion tasks. We highlight that MambaVF enjoys high efficiency, reducing up to 92.25% of parameters and 88.79% of computational FLOPs and a 2.1x speedup compared to existing methods.

      <title>Context Forcing: Consistent Autoregressive Video Generation with Long Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent approaches to real-time long video generation typically employ streaming tuning strategies, attempting to train a long-context student using a short-context (memoryless) teacher. In these frameworks, the student performs long rollouts but receives supervision from a teacher limited to short 5-second windows. This structural discrepancy creates a critical \textbf{student-teacher mismatch}: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global temporal dependencies, effectively capping the student's context length. To resolve this, we propose \textbf{Context Forcing}, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Splat and Distill: Augmenting Teachers with Feed-Forward 3D Reconstruction For 3D-Aware Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have achieved remarkable success when applied to various downstream 2D tasks. Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

      <title>V-Retrver: Evidence-Driven Agentic Reasoning for Universal Multimodal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.</description>

      <title>InterPrior: Scaling Generative Control for Physics-Based Human-Object Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.</description>

      <title>Thinking with Geometry: Active Geometry Integration for Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence.

      <title>SwimBird: Eliciting Switchable Reasoning Mode in Hybrid Autoregressive MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in multimodal perception and reasoning by bridging vision and language. However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as "visual thoughts" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods.</description>

      <title>Predicting Camera Pose from Perspective Descriptions for Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-image spatial reasoning remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions. We also include human-annotated viewpoint descriptions in the test split to evaluate generalization to human language. CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and predicts target poses from natural-language viewpoint descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20{\deg} and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold. This direct grounding avoids expensive test-time search-and-match, reducing inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example and enabling fast, interactive use in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A General-Purpose Diversified 2D Seismic Image Dataset from NAMSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Unicamp-NAMSS dataset, a large, diverse, and geographically distributed collection of migrated 2D seismic sections designed to support modern machine learning research in geophysics. We constructed the dataset from the National Archive of Marine Seismic Surveys (NAMSS), which contains decades of publicly available marine seismic data acquired across multiple regions, acquisition conditions, and geological settings. After a comprehensive collection and filtering process, we obtained 2588 cleaned and standardized seismic sections from 122 survey areas, covering a wide range of vertical and horizontal sampling characteristics. To ensure reliable experimentation, we balanced the dataset so that no survey dominates the distribution, and partitioned it into non-overlapping macro-regions for training, validation, and testing. This region-disjoint split allows robust evaluation of generalization to unseen geological and acquisition conditions.
  We validated the dataset through quantitative and embedding-space analyses using both convolutional and transformer-based models. These analyses showed that Unicamp-NAMSS exhibits substantial variability within and across regions, while maintaining coherent structure across acquisition macro-region and survey types. Comparisons with widely used interpretation datasets (Parihaka and F3 Block) further demonstrated that Unicamp-NAMSS covers a broader portion of the seismic appearance space, making it a strong candidate for machine learning model pretraining. The dataset, therefore, provides a valuable resource for machine learning tasks, including self-supervised representation learning, transfer learning, benchmarking supervised tasks such as super-resolution or attribute prediction, and studying domain adaptation in seismic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Temporal Pair Consistency for Variance-Reduced Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and rectified flow, learn time-dependent vector fields but are typically trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, leading to high estimator variance and inefficient sampling. Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.</description>

      <title>Untwisting RoPE: Frequency Control for Shared Attention in DiTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positional encodings are essential to transformer-based generative models, yet their behavior in multimodal and attention-sharing settings is not fully understood. In this work, we present a principled analysis of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), showing that RoPE naturally decomposes into frequency components with distinct positional sensitivities. We demonstrate that this frequency structure explains why shared-attention mechanisms, where a target image is generated while attending to tokens from a reference image, can lead to reference copying, in which the model reproduces content from the reference instead of extracting only its stylistic cues. Our analysis reveals that the high-frequency components of RoPE dominate the attention computation, forcing queries to attend mainly to spatially aligned reference tokens and thereby inducing this unintended copying behavior. Building on these insights, we introduce a method for selectively modulating RoPE frequency bands so that attention reflects semantic similarity rather than strict positional alignment. Applied to modern transformer-based diffusion architectures, where all tokens share attention, this modulation restores stable and meaningful shared attention. As a result, it enables effective control over the degree of style transfer versus content copying, yielding a proper style-aligned generation process in which stylistic attributes are transferred without duplicating reference content.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Inverse Graphics for Zero-shot Scene Reconstruction and Robot Grasping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operating effectively in novel real-world environments requires robotic systems to estimate and interact with previously unseen objects. Current state-of-the-art models address this challenge by using large amounts of training data and test-time samples to build black-box scene representations. In this work, we introduce a differentiable neuro-graphics model that combines neural foundation models with physics-based differentiable rendering to perform zero-shot scene reconstruction and robot grasping without relying on any additional 3D data or test-time samples. Our model solves a series of constrained optimization problems to estimate physically consistent scene parameters, such as meshes, lighting conditions, material properties, and 6D poses of previously unseen objects from a single RGBD image and bounding boxes. We evaluated our approach on standard model-free few-shot benchmarks and demonstrated that it outperforms existing algorithms for model-free few-shot pose estimation. Furthermore, we validated the accuracy of our scene reconstructions by applying our algorithm to a zero-shot grasping task. By enabling zero-shot, physically-consistent scene reconstruction and grasping without reliance on extensive datasets or test-time sampling, our approach offers a pathway towards more data efficient, interpretable and generalizable robot autonomy in novel environments.</description>

      <title>QuantumGS: Quantum Encoding Framework for Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled real-time rendering of complex scenes. However, standard 3DGS relies on spherical harmonics, which often struggle to accurately capture high-frequency view-dependent effects such as sharp reflections and transparency. While hybrid approaches like Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) mitigate this limitation using classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they remain limited by the expressivity of classical networks in low-parameter regimes. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. We propose a unique encoding strategy that maps the viewing direction directly onto the Bloch sphere, leveraging the natural geometry of qubits to represent 3D directional data. By replacing classical color-modulating networks with quantum circuits generated via a hypernetwork or conditioning mechanism, we achieve higher expressivity and better generalization.

      <title>Gabor Fields: Orientation-Selective Level-of-Detail for Volume Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian-based representations have enabled efficient physically-based volume rendering at a fraction of the memory cost of regular, discrete, voxel-based distributions. However, several remaining issues hamper their widespread use. One of the advantages of classic voxel grids is the ease of constructing hierarchical representations by either storing volumetric mipmaps or selectively pruning branches of an already hierarchical voxel grid. Such strategies reduce rendering time and eliminate aliasing when lower levels of detail are required. Constructing similar strategies for Gaussian-based volumes is not trivial. Straightforward solutions, such as prefiltering or computing mipmap-style representations, lead to increased memory requirements or expensive re-fitting of each level separately. Additionally, such solutions do not guarantee a smooth transition between different hierarchy levels. To address these limitations, we propose Gabor Fields, an orientation-selective mixture of Gabor kernels that enables continuous frequency filtering at no cost. The frequency content of the asset is reduced by selectively pruning primitives, directly benefiting rendering performance. Beyond filtering, we demonstrate that stochastically sampling from different frequencies and orientations at each ray recursion enables masking substantial portions of the volume, accelerating ray traversal time in single- and multiple-scattering settings. Furthermore, inspired by procedural volumes, we present an application for efficient design and rendering of procedural clouds as Gabor-noise-modulated Gaussians.</description>

      <title>Rule-Based Spatial Mixture-of-Experts U-Net for Explainable Edge Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models like U-Net and its variants, have established state-of-the-art performance in edge detection tasks and are used by Generative AI services world-wide for their image generation models. However, their decision-making processes remain opaque, operating as "black boxes" that obscure the rationale behind specific boundary predictions. This lack of transparency is a critical barrier in safety-critical applications where verification is mandatory. To bridge the gap between high-performance deep learning and interpretable logic, we propose the Rule-Based Spatial Mixture-of-Experts U-Net (sMoE U-Net). Our architecture introduces two key innovations: (1) Spatially-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (sMoE) blocks integrated into the decoder skip connections, which dynamically gate between "Context" (smooth) and "Boundary" (sharp) experts based on local feature statistics; and (2) a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) Fuzzy Head that replaces the standard classification layer. This fuzzy head fuses deep semantic features with heuristic edge signals using explicit IF-THEN rules. We evaluate our method on the BSDS500 benchmark, achieving an Optimal Dataset Scale (ODS) F-score of 0.7628, effectively matching purely deep baselines like HED (0.7688) while outperforming the standard U-Net (0.7437). Crucially, our model provides pixel-level explainability through "Rule Firing Maps" and "Strategy Maps," allowing users to visualize whether an edge was detected due to strong gradients, high semantic confidence, or specific logical rule combinations.</description>

      <title>Extreme Weather Nowcasting via Local Precipitation Pattern Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensembling for Interpretable Retinopathy of Prematurity Screening via Active Query and Vascular Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is among the major causes of preventable childhood blindness. Automated screening remains challenging, primarily due to limited data availability and the complex condition involving both structural staging and microvascular abnormalities. Current deep learning models depend heavily on large private datasets and passive multimodal fusion, which commonly fail to generalize on small, imbalanced public cohorts. We thus propose the Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensemble Model (CAA Ensemble) that simulates clinical reasoning through two specialized streams. First, the Multi-Scale Active Query Network (MS-AQNet) serves as a structure specialist, utilizing clinical contexts as dynamic query vectors to spatially control visual feature extraction for localization of the fibrovascular ridge. Secondly, VascuMIL encodes Vascular Topology Maps (VMAP) within a gated Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) network to precisely identify vascular tortuosity. A synergistic meta-learner ensembles these orthogonal signals to resolve diagnostic discordance across multiple objectives. Tested on a highly imbalanced cohort of 188 infants (6,004 images), the framework attained State-of-the-Art performance on two distinct clinical tasks: achieving a Macro F1-Score of 0.93 for Broad ROP staging and an AUC of 0.996 for Plus Disease detection. Crucially, the system features `Glass Box' transparency through counterfactual attention heatmaps and vascular threat maps, proving that clinical metadata dictates the model's visual search. Additionally, this study demonstrates that architectural inductive bias can serve as an effective bridge for the medical AI data gap.</description>

      <title>Erase at the Core: Representation Unlearning for Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many approximate machine unlearning methods demonstrate strong logit-level forgetting -- such as near-zero accuracy on the forget set -- yet continue to preserve substantial information within their internal feature representations. We refer to this discrepancy as superficial forgetting. Recent studies indicate that most existing unlearning approaches primarily alter the final classifier, leaving intermediate representations largely unchanged and highly similar to those of the original model. To address this limitation, we introduce the Erase at the Core (EC), a framework designed to enforce forgetting throughout the entire network hierarchy. EC integrates multi-layer contrastive unlearning on the forget set with retain set preservation through deeply supervised learning. Concretely, EC attaches auxiliary modules to intermediate layers and applies both contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses at each supervision point, with layer-wise weighted losses. Experimental results show that EC not only achieves effective logit-level forgetting, but also substantially reduces representational similarity to the original model across intermediate layers. Furthermore, EC is model-agnostic and can be incorporated as a plug-in module into existing unlearning methods, improving representation-level forgetting while maintaining performance on the retain set.</description>

      <title>M$^2$-Miner: Multi-Agent Enhanced MCTS for Mobile GUI Agent Data Mining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.</description>

      <title>Towards Segmenting the Invisible: An End-to-End Registration and Segmentation Framework for Weakly Supervised Tumour Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liver tumour ablation presents a significant clinical challenge: whilst tumours are clearly visible on pre-operative MRI, they are often effectively invisible on intra-operative CT due to minimal contrast between pathological and healthy tissue. This work investigates the feasibility of cross-modality weak supervision for scenarios where pathology is visible in one modality (MRI) but absent in another (CT). We present a hybrid registration-segmentation framework that combines MSCGUNet for inter-modal image registration with a UNet-based segmentation module, enabling registration-assisted pseudo-label generation for CT images. Our evaluation on the CHAOS dataset demonstrates that the pipeline can successfully register and segment healthy liver anatomy, achieving a Dice score of 0.72. However, when applied to clinical data containing tumours, performance degrades substantially (Dice score of 0.16), revealing the fundamental limitations of current registration methods when the target pathology lacks corresponding visual features in the target modality. We analyse the "domain gap" and "feature absence" problems, demonstrating that whilst spatial propagation of labels via registration is feasible for visible structures, segmenting truly invisible pathology remains an open challenge. Our findings highlight that registration-based label transfer cannot compensate for the absence of discriminative features in the target modality, providing important insights for future research in cross-modality medical image analysis.

      <title>Refine and Purify: Orthogonal Basis Optimization with Null-Space Denoising for Conditional Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.</description>

      <title>XEmoGPT: An Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition Framework with Cue-Level Perception and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition plays a crucial role in applications such as human-computer interaction and social media analytics. However, current approaches struggle with cue-level perception and reasoning due to two main challenges: 1) general-purpose modality encoders are pretrained to capture global structures and general semantics rather than fine-grained emotional cues, resulting in limited sensitivity to emotional signals; and 2) available datasets usually involve a trade-off between annotation quality and scale, which leads to insufficient supervision for emotional cues and ultimately limits cue-level reasoning. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics are inadequate for assessing cue-level reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose eXplainable Emotion GPT (XEmoGPT), a novel EMER framework capable of both perceiving and reasoning over emotional cues. It incorporates two specialized modules: the Video Emotional Cue Bridge (VECB) and the Audio Emotional Cue Bridge (AECB), which enhance the video and audio encoders through carefully designed tasks for fine-grained emotional cue perception. To further support cue-level reasoning, we construct a large-scale dataset, EmoCue, designed to teach XEmoGPT how to reason over multimodal emotional cues. In addition, we introduce EmoCue-360, an automated metric that extracts and matches emotional cues using semantic similarity, and release EmoCue-Eval, a benchmark of 400 expert-annotated samples covering diverse emotional scenarios. Experimental results show that XEmoGPT achieves strong performance in both emotional cue perception and reasoning.</description>

      <title>When Shared Knowledge Hurts: Spectral Over-Accumulation in Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single model by adding their weight updates, providing a lightweight alternative to retraining. Existing methods primarily target resolving conflicts between task updates, leaving the failure mode of over-counting shared knowledge unaddressed. We show that when tasks share aligned spectral directions (i.e., overlapping singular vectors), a simple linear combination repeatedly accumulates these directions, inflating the singular values and biasing the merged model toward shared subspaces. To mitigate this issue, we propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing method that quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum. Across vision and language benchmarks, SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by modifying only the singular values, SVC improves the performance of Task Arithmetic by 13.0%. Code is available at: https://github.com/lyymuwu/SVC.</description>

      <title>VLN-Pilot: Large Vision-Language Model as an Autonomous Indoor Drone Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces VLN-Pilot, a novel framework in which a large Vision-and-Language Model (VLLM) assumes the role of a human pilot for indoor drone navigation. By leveraging the multimodal reasoning abilities of VLLMs, VLN-Pilot interprets free-form natural language instructions and grounds them in visual observations to plan and execute drone trajectories in GPS-denied indoor environments. Unlike traditional rule-based or geometric path-planning approaches, our framework integrates language-driven semantic understanding with visual perception, enabling context-aware, high-level flight behaviors with minimal task-specific engineering. VLN-Pilot supports fully autonomous instruction-following for drones by reasoning about spatial relationships, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic reactivity to unforeseen events. We validate our framework on a custom photorealistic indoor simulation benchmark and demonstrate the ability of the VLLM-driven agent to achieve high success rates on complex instruction-following tasks, including long-horizon navigation with multiple semantic targets. Experimental results highlight the promise of replacing remote drone pilots with a language-guided autonomous agent, opening avenues for scalable, human-friendly control of indoor UAVs in tasks such as inspection, search-and-rescue, and facility monitoring. Our results suggest that VLLM-based pilots may dramatically reduce operator workload while improving safety and mission flexibility in constrained indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Shiva-DiT: Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection for Efficient Diffusion Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) incur prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and the strict static budgets required for hardware overhead. To address this, we propose Shiva-DiT, which effectively reconciles these conflicting requirements via Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection. By leveraging a residual-aware straight-through estimator, our method enforces deterministic token counts for static compilation while preserving end-to-end learnability through residual gradient estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to autonomously learn an adaptive pruning schedule. Experiments on mainstream models, including SD3.5, demonstrate that Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54$\times$ wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads.</description>

      <title>Ethology of Latent Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study challenges the presumed neutrality of latent spaces in vision language models (VLMs) by adopting an ethological perspective on their algorithmic behaviors. Rather than constituting spaces of homogeneous indeterminacy, latent spaces exhibit model-specific algorithmic sensitivities, understood as differential regimes of perceptual salience shaped by training data and architectural choices.
  Through a comparative analysis of three models (OpenAI CLIP, OpenCLIP LAION, SigLIP) applied to a corpus of 301 artworks (15th to 20th), we reveal substantial divergences in the attribution of political and cultural categories. Using bipolar semantic axes derived from vector analogies (Mikolov et al., 2013), we show that SigLIP classifies 59.4% of the artworks as politically engaged, compared to only 4% for OpenCLIP. African masks receive the highest political scores in SigLIP while remaining apolitical in OpenAI CLIP. On an aesthetic colonial axis, inter-model discrepancies reach 72.6 percentage points.
  We introduce three operational concepts: computational latent politicization, describing the emergence of political categories without intentional encoding; emergent bias, irreducible to statistical or normative bias and detectable only through contrastive analysis; and three algorithmic scopic regimes: entropic (LAION), institutional (OpenAI), and semiotic (SigLIP), which structure distinct modes of visibility. Drawing on Foucault's notion of the archive, Jameson's ideologeme, and Simondon's theory of individuation, we argue that training datasets function as quasi-archives whose discursive formations crystallize within latent space. This work contributes to a critical reassessment of the conditions under which VLMs are applied to digital art history and calls for methodologies that integrate learning architectures into any delegation of cultural interpretation to algorithmic agents.</description>

      <title>Disc-Centric Contrastive Learning for Lumbar Spine Severity Grading</title>

Abstract: This work examines a disc-centric approach for automated severity grading of lumbar spinal stenosis from sagittal T2-weighted MRI. The method combines contrastive pretraining with disc-level fine-tuning, using a single anatomically localized region of interest per intervertebral disc. Contrastive learning is employed to help the model focus on meaningful disc features and reduce sensitivity to irrelevant differences in image appearance. The framework includes an auxiliary regression task for disc localization and applies weighted focal loss to address class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate a 78.1% balanced accuracy and a reduced severe-to-normal misclassification rate of 2.13% compared with supervised training from scratch. Detecting discs with moderate severity can still be challenging, but focusing on disc-level features provides a practical way to assess the lumbar spinal stenosis.</description>

      <title>CommCP: Efficient Multi-Agent Coordination via LLM-Based Communication with Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To complete assignments provided by humans in natural language, robots must interpret commands, generate and answer relevant questions for scene understanding, and manipulate target objects. Real-world deployments often require multiple heterogeneous robots with different manipulation capabilities to handle different assignments cooperatively. Beyond the need for specialized manipulation skills, effective information gathering is important in completing these assignments. To address this component of the problem, we formalize the information-gathering process in a fully cooperative setting as an underexplored multi-agent multi-task Embodied Question Answering (MM-EQA) problem, which is a novel extension of canonical Embodied Question Answering (EQA), where effective communication is crucial for coordinating efforts without redundancy. To address this problem, we propose CommCP, a novel LLM-based decentralized communication framework designed for MM-EQA. Our framework employs conformal prediction to calibrate the generated messages, thereby minimizing receiver distractions and enhancing communication reliability. To evaluate our framework, we introduce an MM-EQA benchmark featuring diverse, photo-realistic household scenarios with embodied questions. Experimental results demonstrate that CommCP significantly enhances the task success rate and exploration efficiency over baselines. The experiment videos, code, and dataset are available on our project website: https://comm-cp.github.io.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Invertible Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) serves as the fundamental solution for linear systems. In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of PInv to the nonlinear regime in general and to neural networks in particular. We introduce Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN), a class of architectures explicitly designed to admit a tractable non-linear PInv. The proposed non-linear PInv and its implementation in SPNN satisfy fundamental geometric properties. One such property is null-space projection or "Back-Projection", $x' = x + A^\dagger(y-Ax)$, which moves a sample $x$ to its closest consistent state $x'$ satisfying $Ax=y$. We formalize Non-Linear Back-Projection (NLBP), a method that guarantees the same consistency constraint for non-linear mappings $f(x)=y$ via our defined PInv. We leverage SPNNs to expand the scope of zero-shot inverse problems. Diffusion-based null-space projection has revolutionized zero-shot solving for linear inverse problems by exploiting closed-form back-projection. We extend this method to non-linear degradations. Here, "degradation" is broadly generalized to include any non-linear loss of information, spanning from optical distortions to semantic abstractions like classification. This approach enables zero-shot inversion of complex degradations and allows precise semantic control over generative outputs without retraining the diffusion prior.</description>

      <title>Shared LoRA Subspaces for almost Strict Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19254v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has profoundly enhanced the fidelity of image generation, but it has raised concerns about copyright infringements. While prior methods have introduced adversarial perturbations to prevent style imitation, most are accompanied by the degradation of artworks' visual quality. Recognizing the importance of maintaining this, we introduce a visually improved protection method while preserving its protection capability. To this end, we devise a perceptual map to highlight areas sensitive to human eyes, guided by instance-aware refinement, which refines the protection intensity accordingly. We also introduce a difficulty-aware protection by predicting how difficult the artwork is to protect and dynamically adjusting the intensity based on this. Lastly, we integrate a perceptual constraints bank to further improve the imperceptibility. Results show that our method substantially elevates the quality of the protected image without compromising on protection efficacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image inpainting is a valuable technique for enhancing images that have been corrupted. The primary challenge in this research revolves around the extent of corruption in the input image that the deep learning model must restore. To address this challenge, we introduce a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for learning and replicating the missing pixels. Additionally, we have developed a distinct variant of the Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN), which we refer to as the Semi-SRGAN (SSRGAN). Furthermore, we leveraged three diverse datasets to assess the robustness and accuracy of our proposed model. Our training process involves varying levels of pixel corruption to attain optimal accuracy and generate high-quality images.</description>

      <title>MVGS: Multi-view Regulated Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works in volume rendering, \textit{e.g.} NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), significantly advance the rendering quality and efficiency with the help of the learned implicit neural radiance field or 3D Gaussians. Rendering on top of an explicit representation, the vanilla 3DGS and its variants deliver real-time efficiency by optimizing the parametric model with single-view supervision per iteration during training which is adopted from NeRF. Consequently, certain views are overfitted, leading to unsatisfying appearance in novel-view synthesis and imprecise 3D geometries. To solve aforementioned problems, we propose a new 3DGS optimization method embodying four key novel contributions: 1) We transform the conventional single-view training paradigm into a multi-view training strategy. With our proposed multi-view regulation, 3D Gaussian attributes are further optimized without overfitting certain training views. As a general solution, we improve the overall accuracy in a variety of scenarios and different Gaussian variants. 2) Inspired by the benefit introduced by additional views, we further propose a cross-intrinsic guidance scheme, leading to a coarse-to-fine training procedure concerning different resolutions. 3) Built on top of our multi-view regulated training, we further propose a cross-ray densification strategy, densifying more Gaussian kernels in the ray-intersect regions from a selection of views. 4) By further investigating the densification strategy, we found that the effect of densification should be enhanced when certain views are distinct dramatically. As a solution, we propose a novel multi-view augmented densification strategy, where 3D Gaussians are encouraged to get densified to a sufficient number accordingly, resulting in improved reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Efficient Scene Modeling via Structure-Aware and Region-Prioritized 3D Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes with high fidelity and efficiency remains a central pursuit in computer vision and graphics. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable photorealistic rendering with Gaussian primitives, yet the modeling process remains governed predominantly by photometric supervision. This reliance often leads to irregular spatial distribution and indiscriminate primitive adjustments that largely ignore underlying geometric context. In this work, we rethink Gaussian modeling from a geometric standpoint and introduce Mini-Splatting2, an efficient scene modeling framework that couples structure-aware distribution and region-prioritized optimization, driving 3DGS into a geometry-regulated paradigm. The structure-aware distribution enforces spatial regularity through structured reorganization and representation sparsity, ensuring balanced structural coverage for compact organization. The region-prioritized optimization improves training discrimination through geometric saliency and computational selectivity, fostering appropriate structural emergence for fast convergence. These mechanisms alleviate the long-standing tension among representation compactness, convergence acceleration, and rendering fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mini-Splatting2 achieves up to 4$\times$ fewer Gaussians and 3$\times$ faster optimization while maintaining state-of-the-art visual quality, paving the way towards structured and efficient 3D Gaussian modeling.</description>

      <title>RAD: Region-Aware Diffusion Models for Image Inpainting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09191v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, with applications broadening across various domains. Inpainting is one such application that can benefit significantly from diffusion models. Existing methods either hijack the reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model or cast the problem into a larger framework, \ie, conditioned generation. However, these approaches often require nested loops in the generation process or additional components for conditioning. In this paper, we present region-aware diffusion models (RAD) for inpainting with a simple yet effective reformulation of the vanilla diffusion models. RAD utilizes a different noise schedule for each pixel, which allows local regions to be generated asynchronously while considering the global image context. A plain reverse process requires no additional components, enabling RAD to achieve inference time up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune RAD based on other pretrained diffusion models, reducing computational burdens in training as well. Experiments demonstrated that RAD provides state-of-the-art results both qualitatively and quantitatively, on the FFHQ, LSUN Bedroom, and ImageNet datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human body restoration, as a specific application of image restoration, is widely applied in practice and plays a vital role across diverse fields. However, thorough research remains difficult, particularly due to the lack of benchmark datasets. In this study, we propose a high-quality dataset automated cropping and filtering (HQ-ACF) pipeline. This pipeline leverages existing object detection datasets and other unlabeled images to automatically crop and filter high-quality human images. Using this pipeline, we constructed a person-based restoration with sophisticated objects and natural activities (\emph{PERSONA}) dataset, which includes training, validation, and test sets. The dataset significantly surpasses other human-related datasets in both quality and content richness. Finally, we propose \emph{OSDHuman}, a novel one-step diffusion model for human body restoration. Specifically, we propose a high-fidelity image embedder (HFIE) as the prompt generator to better guide the model with low-quality human image information, effectively avoiding misleading prompts. Experimental results show that OSDHuman outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. The dataset and code will at https://github.com/gobunu/OSDHuman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and forecasting future scene states is critical for autonomous agents to plan and act effectively in complex environments. Object-centric models, with structured latent spaces, have shown promise in modeling object dynamics and predicting future scene states, but often struggle to scale beyond simple synthetic datasets and to integrate external guidance, limiting their applicability in robotics. To address these limitations, we propose TextOCVP, an object-centric model for video prediction guided by textual descriptions. TextOCVP parses an observed scene into object representations, called slots, and utilizes a text-conditioned transformer predictor to forecast future object states and video frames. Our approach jointly models object dynamics and interactions while incorporating textual guidance, enabling accurate and controllable predictions. TextOCVP's structured latent space offers a more precise control of the forecasting process, outperforming several video prediction baselines on two datasets. Additionally, we show that structured object-centric representations provide superior robustness to novel scene configurations, as well as improved controllability and interpretability, enabling more precise and understandable predictions. Videos and code are available at https://play-slot.github.io/TextOCVP.</description>

      <title>Vision-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. Scaling up the amount of multimodal math data in the RL training, Vision-R1-32B and Vison-R1-72B achieves 76.4% and 78.2% MathVista benchmark scores, respectively. The datasets and code will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-R1 .</description>

Abstract: Attribution methods reveal which input features a neural network uses for a prediction, adding transparency to their decisions. A common problem is that these attributions seem unspecific, highlighting both important and irrelevant features. We revisit the common attribution pipeline and observe that using logits as attribution target is a main cause of this phenomenon. We show that the solution is in plain sight: considering distributions of attributions over multiple classes using existing attribution methods yields specific and fine-grained attributions. On common benchmarks, including the grid-pointing game and randomization-based sanity checks, this improves the ability of 18 attribution methods across 7 architectures up to 2x, agnostic to model architecture.</description>

      <title>CMD-HAR: Cross-Modal Disentanglement for Wearable Human Activity Recognition</title>

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a fundamental technology for numerous human - centered intelligent applications. Although deep learning methods have been utilized to accelerate feature extraction, issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment remain largely unresolved. The aim of this paper is to address issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment in sensor-based human activity recognition. We propose a spatiotemporal attention modal decomposition alignment fusion strategy to tackle the problem of the mixed distribution of sensor data. Key discriminative features of activities are captured through cross-modal spatio-temporal disentangled representation, and gradient modulation is combined to alleviate data heterogeneity. In addition, a wearable deployment simulation system is constructed. We conducted experiments on a large number of public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.</description>

      <title>LayoutCoT: Unleashing the Deep Reasoning Potential of Large Language Models for Layout Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional layout generation aims to automatically generate visually appealing and semantically coherent layouts from user-defined constraints. While recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results, they typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive fine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability. Alternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which restrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts. To this end, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms layout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for processing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective retrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout, together with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT reasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both semantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring training or fine-tuning. Notably, our CoT reasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep reasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as deepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Bringing Diversity from Diffusion Models to Semantic-Guided Face Asset Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital modeling and reconstruction of human faces serve various applications. However, its availability is often hindered by the requirements of data capturing devices, manual labor, and suitable actors. This situation restricts the diversity, expressiveness, and control over the resulting models. This work aims to demonstrate that a semantically controllable generative network can provide enhanced control over the digital face modeling process. To enhance diversity beyond the limited human faces scanned in a controlled setting, we introduce a novel data generation pipeline that creates a high-quality 3D face database using a pre-trained diffusion model. Our proposed normalization module converts synthesized data from the diffusion model into high-quality scanned data. Using the 44,000 face models we obtained, we further developed an efficient GAN-based generator. This generator accepts semantic attributes as input, and generates geometry and albedo. It also allows continuous post-editing of attributes in the latent space. Our asset refinement component subsequently creates physically-based facial assets. We introduce a comprehensive system designed for creating and editing high-quality face assets. Our proposed model has undergone extensive experiment, comparison and evaluation. We also integrate everything into a web-based interactive tool. We aim to make this tool publicly available with the release of the paper.</description>

      <title>StyleMe3D: Stylization with Disentangled Priors by Multiple Encoders on 3D Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting stylization approaches are limited in their ability to represent diverse artistic styles, frequently defaulting to low-level texture replacement or yielding semantically inconsistent outputs. In this paper, we introduce StyleMe3D, a novel hierarchical framework that achieves comprehensive, high-fidelity stylization by disentangling multi-level style representations while preserving geometric fidelity. The cornerstone of StyleMe3D is Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), which harnesses latent priors from a style-aware diffusion model to provide high-level semantic guidance, ensuring robust and expressive style transfer. To further refine this distillation process, we propose a multi-modal alignment strategy using the CLIP latent space: a CLIP-based style stream evaluator (Contrastive Style Descriptor) that enforces middle-level stylistic similarity, and a CLIP-based content stream evaluator (3D Gaussian Quality Assessment) that acts as a global regularizer to mitigate typical GS quality degradation. Finally, a VGG-based Simultaneously Optimized Scale module is integrated to refine fine-grained texture details at the low-level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently preserves intricate geometric details and achieves coherent stylistic effects across entire scenes, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Event2Vec: Processing Neuromorphic Events Directly by Representations in Vector Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15371v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic event cameras possess superior temporal resolution, power efficiency, and dynamic range compared to traditional cameras. However, their asynchronous and sparse data format poses a significant challenge for conventional deep learning methods. Existing methods either convert the events into dense synchronous frame representations for processing by powerful CNNs or Transformers, but lose the asynchronous, sparse and high temporal resolution characteristics of events during the conversion process; or adopt irregular models such as sparse convolution, spiking neural networks, or graph neural networks to process the irregular event representations but fail to take full advantage of GPU acceleration. Inspired by word-to-vector models, we draw an analogy between words and events to introduce event2vec, a novel representation that allows neural networks to process events directly. This approach is fully compatible with the parallel processing capabilities of Transformers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of event2vec on the DVS Gesture, ASL-DVS, and DVS-Lip benchmarks, showing that event2vec is remarkably parameter-efficient, features high throughput and low latency, and achieves high accuracy even with an extremely low number of events or low spatial resolutions. Event2vec introduces a novel paradigm by demonstrating for the first time that sparse, irregular event data can be directly integrated into high-throughput Transformer architectures. This breakthrough resolves the long-standing conflict between maintaining data sparsity and maximizing GPU efficiency, offering a promising balance for real-time, low-latency neuromorphic vision tasks. The code is provided in https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Panda/event2vec.</description>

      <title>DPMambaIR: All-in-One Image Restoration via Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All-in-One image restoration aims to address multiple image degradation problems using a single model, offering a more practical and versatile solution compared to designing dedicated models for each degradation type. Existing approaches typically rely on Degradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide image restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation information and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome these limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration framework that introduces a fine-grained degradation extractor and a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM). The DP-SSM leverages the fine-grained degradation features captured by the extractor as dynamic prompts, which are then incorporated into the state space modeling process. This enhances the model's adaptability to diverse degradation types, while a complementary High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB) recovers local high-frequency details. Extensive experiments on a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR achieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM, respectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of DPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.</description>

      <title>Histo-Miner: Deep learning based tissue features extraction pipeline from H&amp;E whole slide images of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in digital pathology have enabled comprehensive analysis of Whole-Slide Images (WSI) from tissue samples, leveraging high-resolution microscopy and computational capabilities. Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.907 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.</description>

      <title>Improved Bag-of-Words Image Retrieval with Geometric Constraints for Ground Texture Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground texture localization using a downward-facing camera offers a low-cost, high-precision localization solution that is robust to dynamic environments and requires no environmental modification. We present a significantly improved bag-of-words (BoW) image retrieval system for ground texture localization, achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages an approximate $k$-means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately improve their results.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Local-Whole Elastic Deformation Modeling for Point Cloud Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing point cloud representation learning methods primarily rely on data-driven strategies to extract geometric information from large amounts of scattered data. However, most methods focus solely on the spatial distribution features of point clouds while overlooking the relationship between local information and the whole structure, which limits the accuracy of point cloud representation. Local information reflect the fine-grained variations of an object, while the whole structure is determined by the interaction and combination of these local features, collectively defining the object's shape. In real-world, objects undergo deformation under external forces, and this deformation gradually affects the whole structure through the propagation of forces from local regions, thereby altering the object's geometric features. Therefore, appropriately introducing a physics-driven mechanism to capture the topological relationships between local parts and the whole object can effectively mitigate for the limitations of data-driven point cloud methods in structural modeling, and enhance the generalization and interpretability of point cloud representations for downstream tasks such as understanding and recognition. Inspired by this, we incorporate a physics-driven mechanism into the data-driven method to learn fine-grained features in point clouds and model the structural relationship between local regions and the whole shape. Specifically, we design a dual-task encoder-decoder framework that combines the geometric modeling capability of data-driven implicit fields with physics-driven elastic deformation. Through the integration of physics-based loss functions, the framework is guided to predict localized deformation and explicitly capture the correspondence between local structural changes and whole shape variations.</description>

      <title>Image-to-Image Translation with Diffusion Transformers and CLIP-Based Image Conditioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping between a source and a target domain, enabling tasks such as style transfer, appearance transformation, and domain adaptation. In this work, we explore a diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation by adapting Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which combine the denoising capabilities of diffusion models with the global modeling power of transformers. To guide the translation process, we condition the model on image embeddings extracted from a pre-trained CLIP encoder, allowing for fine-grained and structurally consistent translations without relying on text or class labels. We incorporate both a CLIP similarity loss to enforce semantic consistency and an LPIPS perceptual loss to enhance visual fidelity during training. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: face2comics, which translates real human faces to comic-style illustrations, and edges2shoes, which translates edge maps to realistic shoe images. Experimental results demonstrate that DiT, combined with CLIP-based conditioning and perceptual similarity objectives, achieves high-quality, semantically faithful translations, offering a promising alternative to GAN-based models for paired image-to-image translation tasks.</description>

      <title>LookWhere? Efficient Visual Recognition by Learning Where to Look and What to See from Self-Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision transformers are ever larger, more accurate, and more expensive to compute. The expense is even more extreme at high resolution as the number of tokens grows quadratically with the image size. We turn to adaptive computation to cope with this cost by learning to predict where to compute. Our LookWhere method divides the computation between a low-resolution selector and a high-resolution extractor without ever processing the full high-resolution input. We jointly pretrain the selector and extractor without task supervision by distillation from a self-supervised teacher, in effect, learning where and what to compute simultaneously. Unlike prior token reduction methods, which pay to save by pruning already-computed tokens, and prior token selection methods, which require complex and expensive per-task optimization, LookWhere economically and accurately selects and extracts transferrable representations of images. We show that LookWhere excels at sparse recognition on high-resolution inputs (Traffic Signs), maintaining accuracy while reducing FLOPs by up to 34x and time by 6x. It also excels at standard recognition tasks that are global (ImageNet classification) or local (ADE20K segmentation), improving accuracy while reducing time by 1.36x.

      <title>Many-for-Many: Unify the Training of Multiple Video and Image Generation and Manipulation Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many visual generation and manipulation tasks. Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines. Our models and source codes are available at https://github.com/leeruibin/MfM.git.</description>

      <title>GIQ: Benchmarking 3D Geometric Reasoning of Vision Foundation Models with Simulated and Real Polyhedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet recent works cast doubt on their true understanding of geometric properties. We introduce GOQ, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ comprises synthetic and real-world images and corresponding 3D meshes of diverse polyhedra covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry, from Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids to stellations and compound shapes. Through systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to reconstruct even basic geometric Platonic solids accurately. Next, although foundation models may be shown via linear and non-linear probing to capture specific 3D symmetry elements, they falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claud exhibit remarkably low accuracy in interpreting basic shape properties such as face geometry, convexity, and compound structures of complex polyhedra. GIQ is publicly available at toomanymatts.github.io/giq-benchmark/, providing a structured platform to benchmark critical gaps in geometric intelligence and facilitate future progress in robust, geometry-aware representation learning.</description>

      <title>Feature Engineering is Not Dead: Reviving Classical Machine Learning with Entropy, HOG, and LBP Feature Fusion for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns, diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image classification and computer vision.</description>

      <title>Personalized Safety Alignment for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, yet their deployment is hindered by a fundamental limitation: safety mechanisms enforce rigid, uniform standards that fail to reflect diverse user preferences shaped by age, culture, or personal beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework that transitions generative safety from static filtration to user-conditioned adaptation. We introduce Sage, a large-scale dataset capturing diverse safety boundaries across 1,000 simulated user profiles, covering complex risks often missed by traditional datasets. By integrating these profiles via a parameter-efficient cross-attention adapter, PSA dynamically modulates generation to align with individual sensitivities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSA achieves a calibrated safety-quality trade-off: under permissive profiles, it relaxes over-cautious constraints to enhance visual fidelity, while under restrictive profiles, it enforces state-of-the-art suppression, significantly outperforming static baselines. Furthermore, PSA exhibits superior instruction adherence compared to prompt-engineering methods, establishing personalization as a vital direction for creating adaptive, user-centered, and responsible generative AI. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/M-E-AGI-Lab/PSAlign.</description>

      <title>BioLite U-Net: Edge-Deployable Semantic Segmentation for In Situ Bioprinting Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process, labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score, and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85% and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame, demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines, BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent, closed-loop bioprinting systems.</description>

      <title>SurgLaVi: Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Surgical Vision-Language Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However, progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets. In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from more than 200 procedures, and featuring hierarchical levels at coarse-, mid-, and fine-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-$\b{eta}$, an open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP datasets. To demonstrate the value of the SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP, a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale, semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.</description>

      <title>TennisTV: Do Multimodal Large Language Models Understand Tennis Rallies?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15602v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks from the stroke level to the rally level and includes 2527 human-verified questions. Evaluating 17 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</description>

      <title>Customizing Visual Emotion Evaluation for MLLMs: An Open-vocabulary, Multifaceted, and Scalable Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps, underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/MVEI.</description>

      <title>RefAM: Attention Magnets for Zero-Shot Referral Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile, large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information, making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise. Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video segmentation benchmarks, our approach achieves strong performance and surpasses prior methods on most datasets, establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning, additional components and complex reasoning.</description>

      <title>PPE: Positional Preservation Embedding for Token Compression in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding (\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/MouxiaoHuang/PPE.</description>

      <title>All You Need for Object Detection: From Pixels, Points, and Prompts to Next-Gen Fusion and Multimodal LLMs/VLMs in Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</description>

      <title>VisMem: Latent Vision Memory Unlocks Potential of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.0% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.</description>

      <title>REArtGS++: Generalizable Articulation Reconstruction with Temporal Geometry Constraint via Planar Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Articulated objects are pervasive in daily environments, such as drawers and refrigerators. Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

      <description>arXiv:2511.17355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74\% to 78\% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75\% to 80\% ($n$=406 patches).</description>

      <title>MRD: Using Physically Based Differentiable Rendering to Probe Vision Models for 3D Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved impressive success in many vision benchmarks, it remains difficult to understand and explain the representations and decisions of these models. Though vision models are typically trained on 2D inputs, they are often assumed to develop an implicit representation of the underlying 3D scene (for example, showing tolerance to partial occlusion, or the ability to reason about relative depth). Here, we introduce MRD (metamers rendered differentiably), an approach that uses physically based differentiable rendering to probe vision models' implicit understanding of generative 3D scene properties, by finding 3D scene parameters that are physically different but produce the same model activation (i.e. are model metamers). Unlike previous pixel-based methods for evaluating model representations, these reconstruction results are always grounded in physical scene descriptions. This means we can, for example, probe a model's sensitivity to object shape while holding material and lighting constant. As a proof-of-principle, we assess multiple models in their ability to recover scene parameters of geometry (shape) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (material). The results show high similarity in model activation between target and optimized scenes, with varying visual results. Qualitatively, these reconstructions help investigate the physical scene attributes to which models are sensitive or invariant. MRD holds promise for advancing our understanding of both computer and human vision by enabling analysis of how physical scene parameters drive changes in model responses.</description>

      <title>MindDrive: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Autonomous Driving via Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an energy-efficient anti-UAV system that integrates frame-based and event-driven object tracking to enable reliable detection of small and fast-moving drones. The system reconstructs binary event frames using run-length encoding, generates region proposals, and adaptively switches between frame mode and event mode based on object size and velocity. A Fast Object Tracking Unit improves robustness for high-speed targets through adaptive thresholding and trajectory-based classification. The neural processing unit supports both grayscale-patch and trajectory inference with a custom instruction set and a zero-skipping MAC architecture, reducing redundant neural computations by more than 97 percent. Implemented in 40 nm CMOS technology, the 2 mm^2 chip achieves 96 pJ per frame per pixel and 61 pJ per event at 0.8 V, and reaches 98.2 percent recognition accuracy on public UAV datasets across 50 to 400 m ranges and 5 to 80 pixels per second speeds. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art end-to-end energy efficiency for anti-UAV systems.</description>

      <title>VisionDirector: Vision-Language Guided Closed-Loop Refinement for Generative Image Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models can now produce photorealistic imagery, yet they still struggle with the long, multi-goal prompts that professional designers issue. To expose this gap and better evaluate models' performance in real-world settings, we introduce Long Goal Bench (LGBench), a 2,000-task suite (1,000 T2I and 1,000 I2I) whose average instruction contains 18 to 22 tightly coupled goals spanning global layout, local object placement, typography, and logo fidelity. We find that even state-of-the-art models satisfy fewer than 72 percent of the goals and routinely miss localized edits, confirming the brittleness of current pipelines. To address this, we present VisionDirector, a training-free vision-language supervisor that (i) extracts structured goals from long instructions, (ii) dynamically decides between one-shot generation and staged edits, (iii) runs micro-grid sampling with semantic verification and rollback after every edit, and (iv) logs goal-level rewards. We further fine-tune the planner with Group Relative Policy Optimization, yielding shorter edit trajectories (3.1 versus 4.2 steps) and stronger alignment. VisionDirector achieves new state of the art on GenEval (plus 7 percent overall) and ImgEdit (plus 0.07 absolute) while producing consistent qualitative improvements on typography, multi-object scenes, and pose editing.</description>

      <title>See Less, See Right: Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping For Multimodal Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often benefit from intermediate visual cues, either injected via external tools or generated as latent visual tokens during reasoning, but these mechanisms still overlook fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and incur high inference-time cost. In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.</description>

      <title>Active Perception Agent for Omnimodal Audio-Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often face challenges in fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, to our best knowledge, the first fully active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized unimodal tools to achieve more fine-grained omnimodal reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, we demonstrate a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and closed-source models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy without training.</description>

      <title>Deep Probabilistic Supervision for Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets without explicitly modeling predictive uncertainty. With this in mind, we propose Deep Probabilistic Supervision (DPS), a principled learning framework constructing sample-specific target distributions via statistical inference on the model's own predictions, remaining independent of hard targets after initialization. We show that DPS consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g., +2.0% for DenseNet-264 on ImageNet) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing self-distillation methods. When combined with a contrastive loss, DPS achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise.</description>

      <title>Quantifying and Inducing Shape Bias in CNNs via Max-Pool Dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit a well-known texture bias, prioritizing local patterns over global shapes - a tendency inherent to their convolutional architecture. While this bias is beneficial for texture-rich natural images, it often degrades performance on shape-dominant data such as illustrations and sketches. Although prior work has proposed shape-biased models to mitigate this issue, these approaches lack a quantitative metric for identifying which datasets would actually benefit from such modifications. To address this limitation, we propose a data-driven metric that quantifies the shape-texture balance within a dataset by computing the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between an image's luminance (Y) channel and its L0-smoothed counterpart. Building on this metric, we introduce a computationally efficient adaptation method that promotes shape bias by modifying the dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen. Experimental results demonstrate consistent accuracy improvements on shape-dominant datasets, particularly in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical, requiring training only the final classification layer.</description>

      <title>Quantification and Classification of Carbon Nanotubes in Electron Micrographs using Vision Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of carbon nanotube morphologies in electron microscopy images is vital for exposure assessment and toxicological studies, yet current workflows rely on slow, subjective manual segmentation. This work presents a unified framework leveraging vision foundation models to automate the quantification and classification of CNTs in electron microscopy images. First, we introduce an interactive quantification tool built on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that segments particles with near-perfect accuracy using minimal user input. Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data. Crucially, this instance-level processing allows the framework to resolve mixed samples, correctly classifying distinct particle types co-existing within a single field of view. These results demonstrate that integrating zero-shot segmentation with self-supervised feature learning enables high-throughput, reproducible nanomaterial analysis, transforming a labor-intensive bottleneck into a scalable, data-driven process.</description>

      <title>Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network for Reliable Multimodal Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable learning of multimodal data (e.g., multi-omics) is a widely concerning issue, especially in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnosis. However, low-quality data induced by multimodal noise poses a major challenge in this domain, causing existing methods to suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to handle heterogeneous data noise, hindering robust multimodal representation learning. Second, they exhibit limited adaptability and generalization when encountering previously unseen noise. To address these issues, we propose Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network (TAHCD). On one hand, TAHCD introduces the Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment to reliably remove heterogeneous noise. They account for noise at both global and instance levels and enable jointly removal of modality-specific and cross-modality noise, achieving robust learning. On the other hand, TAHCD introduces Test-Time Cooperative Enhancement, which adaptively updates the model in response to input noise in a label-free manner, thus improving generalization. This is achieved by collaboratively enhancing the joint removal process of modality-specific and cross-modality noise across global and instance levels according to sample noise. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance, robustness, and generalization compared with state-of-the-art reliable multimodal learning approaches.</description>

Abstract: Glass surfaces create complex interactions of reflected and transmitted light, making single-image reflection removal (SIRR) challenging. Existing datasets suffer from limited physical realism in synthetic data or insufficient scale in real captures. We introduce a synthetic dataset generation framework that path-traces 3D glass models over real background imagery to create physically accurate reflection scenarios with varied glass properties, camera settings, and post-processing effects. To leverage the capabilities of Large Multimodal Model (LMM), we concatenate the image layers into a single composite input, apply joint captioning, and fine-tune the model using task-specific LoRA rather than full-parameter training. This enables our approach to achieve improved reflection removal and separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color photometric stereo enables single-shot surface reconstruction, extending conventional photometric stereo that requires multiple images of a static scene under varying illumination to dynamic scenarios. However, most existing approaches assume ideal distant lighting and Lambertian reflectance, leaving more practical near-light conditions and non-Lambertian surfaces underexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework that leverages neural implicit representations for depth and BRDF modeling under the assumption of mono-chromaticity (uniform chromaticity and homogeneous material), which alleviates the inherent ill-posedness of color photometric stereo and allows for detailed surface recovery from just one image. Furthermore, we design a compact optical tactile sensor to validate our approach. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust surface reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural two-sample tests have recently shown strong power for detecting distributional differences between groups, yet their black-box nature limits interpretability and practical adoption in biomedical analysis. Moreover, most existing post-hoc explainability methods rely on class labels, making them unsuitable for label-free statistical testing settings. We propose an explainable deep statistical testing framework that augments deep two-sample tests with sample-level and feature-level explanations, revealing which individual samples and which input features drive statistically significant group differences. Our method highlights which image regions and which individual samples contribute most to the detected group difference, providing spatial and instance-wise insight into the test's decision. Applied to biomedical imaging data, the proposed framework identifies influential samples and highlights anatomically meaningful regions associated with disease-related variation. This work bridges statistical inference and explainable AI, enabling interpretable, label-free population analysis in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>An AI-enabled tool for quantifying overlapping red blood cell sickling dynamics in microfluidic assays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding sickle cell dynamics requires accurate identification of morphological transitions under diverse biophysical conditions, particularly in densely packed and overlapping cell populations. Here, we present an automated deep learning framework that integrates AI-assisted annotation, segmentation, classification, and instance counting to quantify red blood cell (RBC) populations across varying density regimes in time-lapse microscopy data. Experimental images were annotated using the Roboflow platform to generate labeled dataset for training an nnU-Net segmentation model. The trained network enables prediction of the temporal evolution of the sickle cell fraction, while a watershed algorithm resolves overlapping cells to enhance quantification accuracy. Despite requiring only a limited amount of labeled data for training, the framework achieves high segmentation performance, effectively addressing challenges associated with scarce manual annotations and cell overlap. By quantitatively tracking dynamic changes in RBC morphology, this approach can more than double the experimental throughput via densely packed cell suspensions, capture drug-dependent sickling behavior, and reveal distinct mechanobiological signatures of cellular morphological evolution. Overall, this AI-driven framework establishes a scalable and reproducible computational platform for investigating cellular biomechanics and assessing therapeutic efficacy in microphysiological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.</description>

      <title>PEAR: Pixel-aligned Expressive humAn mesh Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing detailed 3D human meshes from a single in-the-wild image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing SMPLX-based methods often suffer from slow inference, produce only coarse body poses, and exhibit misalignments or unnatural artifacts in fine-grained regions such as the face and hands. These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Histopathological Foundation Models on Regressive Prediction of Homologous Recombination Deficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale histopathology data have found great success in various fields of computational pathology, but their impact on regressive biomarker prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate histopathological foundation models for regression-based tasks, demonstrated through the prediction of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score - a critical biomarker for personalized cancer treatment. Within multiple instance learning frameworks, we extract patch-level features from whole slide images (WSI) using five state-of-the-art foundation models, and evaluate their impact compared to contrastive learning-based features. Models are trained to predict continuous HRD scores based on these extracted features across breast, endometrial, and lung cancer cohorts from two public medical data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on foundation model features consistently outperform the baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities while exhibiting systematic differences among the foundation models. Additionally, we propose a distribution-based upsampling strategy to mitigate target imbalance in these datasets, significantly improving the recall and balanced accuracy for underrepresented but clinically important patient populations. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different sampling strategies and instance bagsizes by ablation studies. Our results highlight the benefits of large-scale histopathological pretraining for more precise and transferable regressive biomarker prediction, showcasing its potential to advance AI-driven precision oncology.</description>

      <title>Robust automatic brain vessel segmentation in 3D CTA scans using dynamic 4D-CTA data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a novel methodology for annotating the brain vasculature using dynamic 4D-CTA head scans. By using multiple time points from dynamic CTA acquisitions, we subtract bone and soft tissue to enhance the visualization of arteries and veins, reducing the effort required to obtain manual annotations of brain vessels. We then train deep learning models on our ground truth annotations by using the same segmentation for multiple phases from the dynamic 4D-CTA collection, effectively enlarging our dataset by 4 to 5 times and inducing robustness to contrast phases. In total, our dataset comprises 110 training images from 25 patients and 165 test images from 14 patients. In comparison with two similarly-sized datasets for CTA-based brain vessel segmentation, a nnUNet model trained on our dataset can achieve significantly better segmentations across all vascular regions, with an average mDC of 0.846 for arteries and 0.957 for veins in the TopBrain dataset. Furthermore, metrics such as average directed Hausdorff distance (adHD) and topology sensitivity (tSens) reflected similar trends: using our dataset resulted in low error margins (adHD of 0.304 mm for arteries and 0.078 for veins) and high sensitivity (tSens of 0.877 for arteries and 0.974 for veins), indicating excellent accuracy in capturing vessel morphology.

      <title>Invariance on Manifolds: Understanding Robust Visual Representations for Place Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) demands representations robust to drastic environmental and viewpoint shifts. Current aggregation paradigms, however, either rely on data-hungry supervision or simplistic first-order statistics, often neglecting intrinsic structural correlations. In this work, we propose a Second-Order Geometric Statistics framework that inherently captures geometric stability without training. We conceptualize scenes as covariance descriptors on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold, where perturbations manifest as tractable congruence transformations. By leveraging geometry-aware Riemannian mappings, we project these descriptors into a linearized Euclidean embedding, effectively decoupling signal structure from noise. Our approach introduces a training-free framework built upon fixed, pre-trained backbones, achieving strong zero-shot generalization without parameter updates. Extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves highly competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines, particularly excelling in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>GMAC: Global Multi-View Constraint for Automatic Multi-Camera Extrinsic Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic calibration of multi-camera systems, namely the accurate estimation of spatial extrinsic parameters, is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, panoramic perception, and multi-view data fusion. Existing methods typically rely on calibration targets, explicit geometric modeling, or task-specific neural networks. Such approaches often exhibit limited robustness and applicability in complex dynamic environments or online scenarios, making them difficult to deploy in practical applications. To address this, this paper proposes GMAC, a multi-camera extrinsic estimation framework based on the implicit geometric representations learned by multi-view reconstruction networks. GMAC models extrinsics as global variables constrained by the latent multi-view geometric structure and prunes and structurally reconfigures existing networks so that their latent features can directly support extrinsic prediction through a lightweight regression head, without requiring a completely new network design. Furthermore, GMAC jointly optimizes cross-view reprojection consistency and multi-view cycle consistency, ensuring geometric coherence across cameras while improving prediction accuracy and optimization stability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-camera datasets demonstrate that GMAC achieves accurate and stable extrinsic estimation without explicit 3D reconstruction or manual calibration, providing a new solution for efficient deployment and online calibration of multi-camera systems.</description>

      <title>FUSE-Flow: Scalable Real-Time Multi-View Point Cloud Reconstruction Using Confidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time multi-view point cloud reconstruction is a core problem in 3D vision and immersive perception, with wide applications in VR, AR, robotic navigation, digital twins, and computer interaction. Despite advances in multi-camera systems and high-resolution depth sensors, fusing large-scale multi-view depth observations into high-quality point clouds under strict real-time constraints remains challenging. Existing methods relying on voxel-based fusion, temporal accumulation, or global optimization suffer from high computational complexity, excessive memory usage, and limited scalability, failing to simultaneously achieve real-time performance, reconstruction quality, and multi-camera extensibility. We propose FUSE-Flow, a frame-wise, stateless, and linearly scalable point cloud streaming reconstruction framework. Each frame independently generates point cloud fragments, fused via two weights, measurement confidence and 3D distance consistency to suppress noise while preserving geometric details. For large-scale multi-camera efficiency, we introduce an adaptive spatial hashing-based weighted aggregation method: 3D space is adaptively partitioned by local point cloud density, representative points are selected per cell, and weighted fusion is performed to handle both sparse and dense regions. With GPU parallelization, FUSE-Flow achieves high-throughput, low-latency point cloud generation and fusion with linear complexity. Experiments demonstrate that the framework improves reconstruction stability and geometric fidelity in overlapping, depth-discontinuous, and dynamic scenes, while maintaining real-time frame rates on modern GPUs, verifying its effectiveness, robustness, and scalability.</description>

      <title>SharpTimeGS: Sharp and Stable Dynamic Gaussian Splatting via Lifespan Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes is fundamental to achieving photorealistic 4D reconstruction and immersive visual experiences. Recent progress in Gaussian-based representations has significantly improved real-time rendering quality, yet existing methods still struggle to maintain a balance between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in both representation and optimization. To address this, we present SharpTimeGS, a lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of both static and dynamic regions under a unified representation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable lifespan parameter that reformulates temporal visibility from a Gaussian-shaped decay into a flat-top profile, allowing primitives to remain consistently active over their intended duration and avoiding redundant densification. In addition, the learned lifespan modulates each primitives' motion, reducing drift in long-lived static points while retaining unrestricted motion for short-lived dynamic ones. This effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity. Moreover, we design a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy that mitigates optimization imbalance between static and dynamic regions by allocating more capacity to regions with pronounced motion while keeping static areas compact and stable. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while supporting real-time rendering up to 4K resolution at 100 FPS on one RTX 4090.</description>

      <title>HP-GAN: Harnessing pretrained networks for GAN improvement with FakeTwins and discriminator consistency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made significant progress in enhancing the quality of image synthesis. Recent methods frequently leverage pretrained networks to calculate perceptual losses or utilize pretrained feature spaces. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of pretrained networks by incorporating innovative self-supervised learning techniques and enforcing consistency between discriminators during GAN training. Our proposed method, named HP-GAN, effectively exploits neural network priors through two primary strategies: FakeTwins and discriminator consistency. FakeTwins leverages pretrained networks as encoders to compute a self-supervised loss and applies this through the generated images to train the generator, thereby enabling the generation of more diverse and high quality images. Additionally, we introduce a consistency mechanism between discriminators that evaluate feature maps extracted from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) feature networks. Discriminator consistency promotes coherent learning among discriminators and enhances training robustness by aligning their assessments of image quality. Our extensive evaluation across seventeen datasets-including scenarios with large, small, and limited data, and covering a variety of image domains-demonstrates that HP-GAN consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), achieving significant improvements in image diversity and quality.

Abstract: Vision and language models (VLMs) are expected to analyse complex documents, such as those containing flowcharts, through a question-answering (QA) interface. The ability to recognise and interpret these flowcharts is in high demand, as they provide valuable insights unavailable in text-only explanations. However, developing VLMs with precise flowchart understanding requires large-scale datasets of flowchart images and corresponding text, the creation of which is highly time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce JSynFlow, a synthesised visual QA dataset for Japanese flowcharts, generated using large language models (LLMs). Our dataset comprises task descriptions for various business occupations, the corresponding flowchart images rendered from domain-specific language (DSL) code, and related QA pairs. This paper details the dataset's synthesis procedure and demonstrates that fine-tuning with JSynFlow significantly improves VLM performance on flowchart-based QA tasks. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jri-advtechlab/jsynflow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feed-forward multi-frame 3D reconstruction models often degrade on videos with object motion. Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.</description>

      <title>PIO-FVLM: Rethinking Training-Free Visual Token Reduction for VLM Acceleration from an Inference-Objective Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, reducing redundant visual tokens in vision-language models (VLMs) to accelerate VLM inference has emerged as a hot topic. However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading paradigm in generative modeling, excelling in various applications. Despite their success, these models often misalign with human intentions and generate results with undesired properties or even harmful content. Inspired by the success and popularity of alignment in tuning large language models, recent studies have investigated aligning diffusion models with human expectations and preferences. This work mainly reviews alignment of diffusion models, covering advancements in fundamentals of alignment, alignment techniques of diffusion models, preference benchmarks, and evaluation for diffusion models. Moreover, we discuss key perspectives on current challenges and promising future directions on solving the remaining challenges in alignment of diffusion models. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive review paper for researchers and engineers to comprehend, practice, and research alignment of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>MaxSup: Overcoming Representation Collapse in Label Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15798v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to reduce overconfidence in neural network predictions and improve generalization. Despite these benefits, recent studies reveal two critical issues with LS. First, LS induces overconfidence in misclassified samples. Second, it compacts feature representations into overly tight clusters, diluting intra-class diversity, although the precise cause of this phenomenon remained elusive. In this paper, we analytically decompose the LS-induced loss, exposing two key terms: (i) a regularization term that dampens overconfidence only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-amplification term that arises under misclassifications. This latter term compels the network to reinforce incorrect predictions with undue certainty, exacerbating representation collapse. To address these shortcomings, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which applies uniform regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit rather than the ground-truth logit. Through extensive feature-space analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Experiments on large-scale image classification and multiple downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS.

      <title>A Contrastive Learning Foundation Model Based on Perfectly Aligned Sample Pairs for Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL) methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically, PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks to augmented images rather than random cropping. Our framework provides high-quality features by ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its sparse inputs. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrates remarkable adaptability to uncurated RS data and reduce the impact of the potential semantic inconsistency. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work will contribute to practical remote sensing interpretation works.</description>

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) is a key building block in modern vision Transformers, yet its quadratic complexity in the number of tokens remains a major bottleneck for real-time and resource-constrained deployment. We present PnP-Nystra, a training-free Nystr\"{o}m-based linear attention module designed as a plug-and-play replacement for MHSA in {pretrained} image restoration Transformers, with provable kernel approximation error guarantees. PnP-Nystra integrates directly into window-based architectures such as SwinIR, Uformer, and Dehazeformer, yielding efficient inference without finetuning. Across denoising, deblurring, dehazing, and super-resolution on images, PnP-Nystra delivers $1.8$--$3.6\times$ speedups on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU and $1.8$--$7\times$ speedups on CPU inference. Compared with the strongest training-free linear-attention baselines we evaluate, our method incurs the smallest quality drop and stays closest to the original model's outputs.</description>

      <title>YOLO-based Bearing Fault Diagnosis With Continuous Wavelet Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a locality-aware bearing fault diagnosis framework that operates on time-frequency representations and enables spatially interpretable decision-making. One-dimensional vibration signals are first mapped to two-dimensional time-frequency spectrograms using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with Morlet wavelets to enhance transient fault signatures. The diagnosis task is then formulated as object detection on the time-frequency plane, where YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and YOLOv11 are employed to localize fault-relevant regions and classify fault types simultaneously. Experiments on three public benchmarks, including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU), and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), demonstrate strong cross-dataset generalization compared with a representative MCNN-LSTM baseline. In particular, YOLOv11 achieves mAP@0.5 of 99.0% (CWRU), 97.8% (PU), and 99.5% (IMS), while providing region-aware visualization of fault patterns in the time-frequency domain. These results suggest that detection-based inference on CWT spectrograms provides an effective and interpretable complementary approach to conventional global classification for rotating machinery condition monitoring.</description>

      <title>Spectral Prefiltering of Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing methods for neural-field filtering.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Iterative Error Correction for Efficient Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand for high-quality image generation on resource-constrained devices, efficient diffusion models have received increasing attention. However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Vector Quantization using Gaussian Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are discrete autoencoders that compress images into discrete tokens. However, they are difficult to train due to discretization. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective technique dubbed Gaussian Quant (GQ), which first trains a Gaussian VAE under certain constraints and then converts it into a VQ-VAE without additional training. For conversion, GQ generates random Gaussian noise as a codebook and finds the closest noise vector to the posterior mean. Theoretically, we prove that when the logarithm of the codebook size exceeds the bits-back coding rate of the Gaussian VAE, a small quantization error is guaranteed. Practically, we propose a heuristic to train Gaussian VAEs for effective conversion, named the target divergence constraint (TDC). Empirically, we show that GQ outperforms previous VQ-VAEs, such as VQGAN, FSQ, LFQ, and BSQ, on both UNet and ViT architectures. Furthermore, TDC also improves previous Gaussian VAE discretization methods, such as TokenBridge. The source code is provided in the supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>RANGER: A Monocular Zero-Shot Semantic Navigation Framework through Contextual Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently finding targets in complex environments is fundamental to real-world embodied applications. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning. The framework integrates several key components: keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model (VLM)-driven exploration value estimation, high-level adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution. Experiments on the HM3D benchmark and real-world environments demonstrate that RANGER achieves competitive performance in terms of navigation success rate and exploration efficiency, while showing superior ICL adaptability, with no previous 3D mapping of the environment required.</description>

      <title>EEG Foundation Models: Progresses, Benchmarking, and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), aiming to learn transferable neural representations from large-scale heterogeneous recordings. Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices.</description>

      <title>Optimized $k$-means color quantization of digital images in machine-based and human perception-based colorspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color quantization represents an image using a fraction of its original number of colors while only minimally losing its visual quality. The $k$-means algorithm is commonly used in this context, but has mostly been applied in the machine-based RGB colorspace composed of the three primary colors. However, some recent studies have indicated its improved performance in human perception-based colorspaces. We investigated the performance of $k$-means color quantization at four quantization levels in the RGB, CIE-XYZ, and CIE-LUV/CIE-HCL colorspaces, on 148 varied digital images spanning a wide range of scenes, subjects and settings. The Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) measure numerically assessed the quality of the quantized images, and showed that in about half of the cases, $k$-means color quantization is best in the RGB space, while at other times, and especially for higher quantization levels ($k$), the CIE-XYZ colorspace is where it usually does better. There are also some cases, especially at lower $k$, where the best performance is obtained in the CIE-LUV colorspace. Further analysis of the performances in terms of the distributions of the hue, chromaticity and luminance in an image presents a nuanced perspective and characterization of the images for which each colorspace is better for $k$-means color quantization.</description>

      <title>EchoJEPA: A Latent Predictive Foundation Model for Echocardiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for echocardiography often struggle to disentangle anatomical signal from the stochastic speckle and acquisition artifacts inherent to ultrasound. We present EchoJEPA, a foundation model trained on 18 million echocardiograms across 300K patients, representing the largest pretraining corpus for this modality to date. By leveraging a latent predictive objective, EchoJEPA learns robust anatomical representations that ignore speckle noise. We validate this using a novel multi-view probing framework with frozen backbones, where EchoJEPA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by approximately 20% in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) estimation and 17% in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) estimation. The model also exhibits remarkable sample efficiency, reaching 79% view classification accuracy with only 1% of labeled data versus 42% for the best baseline trained on 100%. Crucially, EchoJEPA demonstrates superior generalization, degrading by only 2% under physics-informed acoustic perturbations compared to 17% for competitors. Most remarkably, its zero-shot performance on pediatric patients surpasses fully fine-tuned baselines, establishing latent prediction as a superior paradigm for robust, generalizable medical AI.</description>

      <title>Sounding Highlights: Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Audio-Visual Video Highlight Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual video highlight detection aims to automatically identify the most salient moments in videos by leveraging both visual and auditory cues. However, existing models often underutilize the audio modality, focusing on high-level semantic features while failing to fully leverage the rich, dynamic characteristics of sound. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Video Highlight Detection (DAViHD). The dual-pathway audio encoder is composed of a semantic pathway for content understanding and a dynamic pathway that captures spectro-temporal dynamics. The semantic pathway extracts high-level information by identifying the content within the audio, such as speech, music, or specific sound events. The dynamic pathway employs a frequency-adaptive mechanism as time evolves to jointly model these dynamics, enabling it to identify transient acoustic events via salient spectral bands and rapid energy changes. We integrate the novel audio encoder into a full audio-visual framework and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale MrHiSum benchmark. Our results demonstrate that a sophisticated, dual-faceted audio representation is key to advancing the field of highlight detection.</description>

      <title>Representation Geometry as a Diagnostic for Out-of-Distribution Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains difficult to monitor and optimize in the absence of target-domain labels, as models with similar in-distribution accuracy can exhibit markedly different out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics. Our results demonstrate that representation geometry enables interpretable, label-free robustness diagnosis and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.</description>
