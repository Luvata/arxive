      <title>The Role of Visualization in LLM-Assisted Knowledge Graph Systems: Effects on User Trust, Exploration, and Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful data structures, but exploring them effectively remains difficult for even expert users. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to address this gap, yet little is known empirically about how their usage with KGs shapes user trust, exploration strategies, or downstream decision-making - raising key design challenges for LLM-based KG visual analysis systems. To study these effects, we developed LinkQ, a KG exploration system that converts natural language questions into structured queries with an LLM. We collaborated with KG experts to design five visual mechanisms that help users assess the accuracy of both KG queries and LLM responses: an LLM-KG state diagram that illustrates which stage of the exploration pipeline LinkQ is in, a query editor displaying the generated query paired with an LLM explanation, an entity-relation ID table showing extracted KG entities and relations with semantic descriptions, a query structure graph that depicts the path traversed in the KG, and an interactive graph visualization of query results. From a qualitative evaluation with 14 practitioners, we found that users - even KG experts - tended to overtrust LinkQ's outputs due to its "helpful" visualizations, even when the LLM was incorrect. Users exhibited distinct workflows depending on their prior familiarity with KGs and LLMs, challenging the assumption that these systems are one-size-fits-all - despite often being designed as if they are. Our findings highlight the risks of false trust in LLM-assisted data analysis tools and the need for further investigation into the role of visualization as a mitigation technique.</description>

      <title>SIMCOPILOT: Evaluating Large Language Models for Copilot-Style Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SIMCOPILOT, a benchmark that simulates the role of large language models (LLMs) as interactive, "copilot"-style coding assistants. Targeting both completion (finishing incomplete methods or code blocks) and infill tasks (filling missing segments within existing code), SIMCOPILOT provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM coding capabilities. The benchmark comprises dedicated sub-benchmarks for Java (SIMCOPILOTJ) and Python (SIMCOPILOTP), covering diverse codebases varying in size and complexity. Our key contributions include: (a) establishing a realistic, detailed evaluation environment to assess LLM utility in practical coding scenarios, and (b) providing fine-grained analyses that address critical factors frequently overlooked by existing benchmarks, such as task-specific performance nuances, contextual understanding across code segments, and sensitivity to variable scope. Evaluations conducted across domains-including algorithms, databases, computer vision, and neural networks-offer insights into model strengths and highlight persistent challenges in maintaining logical consistency within complex dependency structures. Beyond benchmarking, our study sheds light on the current limitations of LLM-driven code generation and underscores the ongoing transition of LLMs from merely syntax-aware generators toward reliable, intelligent software development partners.</description>

      <title>Temporal Restoration and Spatial Rewiring for Source-Free Multivariate Time Series Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained model from an annotated source domain to an unlabelled target domain without accessing the source data, thereby preserving data privacy. While existing SFDA methods have proven effective in reducing reliance on source data, they struggle to perform well on multivariate time series (MTS) due to their failure to consider the intrinsic spatial correlations inherent in MTS data. These spatial correlations are crucial for accurately representing MTS data and preserving invariant information across domains. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal Restoration and Spatial Rewiring (TERSE), a novel and concise SFDA method tailored for MTS data. Specifically, TERSE comprises a customized spatial-temporal feature encoder designed to capture the underlying spatial-temporal characteristics, coupled with both temporal restoration and spatial rewiring tasks to reinstate latent representations of the temporally masked time series and the spatially masked correlated structures. During the target adaptation phase, the target encoder is guided to produce spatially and temporally consistent features with the source domain by leveraging the source pre-trained temporal restoration and spatial rewiring networks. Therefore, TERSE can effectively model and transfer spatial-temporal dependencies across domains, facilitating implicit feature alignment. In addition, as the first approach to simultaneously consider spatial-temporal consistency in MTS-SFDA, TERSE can also be integrated as a versatile plug-and-play module into established SFDA methods. Extensive experiments on three real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.</description>

      <title>ChemHAS: Hierarchical Agent Stacking for Enhancing Chemistry Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated the ability to improve performance in chemistry-related tasks by selecting appropriate tools. However, their effectiveness remains limited by the inherent prediction errors of chemistry tools. In this paper, we take a step further by exploring how LLMbased agents can, in turn, be leveraged to reduce prediction errors of the tools. To this end, we propose ChemHAS (Chemical Hierarchical Agent Stacking), a simple yet effective method that enhances chemistry tools through optimizing agent-stacking structures from limited data. ChemHAS achieves state-of-the-art performance across four fundamental chemistry tasks, demonstrating that our method can effectively compensate for prediction errors of the tools. Furthermore, we identify and characterize four distinct agent-stacking behaviors, potentially improving interpretability and revealing new possibilities for AI agent applications in scientific research. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/ChemHAS-01E4/README.md.</description>

      <title>FCOS: A Two-Stage Recoverable Model Pruning Framework for Automatic Modulation Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of wireless communications and the growing complexity of digital modulation schemes, traditional manual modulation recognition methods struggle to extract reliable signal features and meet real-time requirements in modern scenarios. Recently, deep learning based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) approaches have greatly improved classification accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Model pruning provides a general approach to reduce model complexity, but existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques each present a trade-off between compression rate, hardware acceleration, and accuracy preservation. To this end, in this paper, we introduce FCOS, a novel Fine-to-COarse two-Stage pruning framework that combines channel-level pruning with layer-level collapse diagnosis to achieve extreme compression, high performance and efficient inference. In the first stage of FCOS, hierarchical clustering and parameter fusion are applied to channel weights to achieve channel-level pruning. Then a Layer Collapse Diagnosis (LaCD) module uses linear probing to identify layer collapse and removes the collapsed layers due to high channel compression ratio. Experiments on multiple AMR benchmarks demonstrate that FCOS outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, FCOS achieves 95.51% FLOPs reduction and 95.31% parameter reduction while still maintaining performance close to the original ResNet56, with only a 0.46% drop in accuracy on Sig2019-12. Code is available at https://github.com/yaolu-zjut/FCOS.</description>

      <title>Spectral-inspired Neural Operator for Data-efficient PDE Simulation in Physics-agnostic Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern the spatiotemporal evolution of various physical systems. Classical numerical solvers, while accurate, require fine discretization and full knowledge of the governing PDEs, limiting their applicability when the physics is unknown or fast inference is required. Data-driven neural PDE solvers alleviate these constraints by learning from data but demand large training datasets and perform poorly in data-scarce regimes. Physics-aware methods mitigate data requirements by incorporating physical knowledge yet rely on known PDE terms or local numerical schemes, restricting their ability to handle unknown or globally coupled systems. In this work, we propose the Spectral-inspired Neural Operator (SINO), a novel framework that learns PDE operators from limited trajectories (as few as 2-5), without any known PDE terms. SINO operates in the frequency domain and introduces a Frequency-to-Vector module to learn spectral representations analogous to derivative multipliers. To model nonlinear physical interactions, we design a nonlinear operator block that includes a $\Pi$-Block with low-pass filtering to prevent aliasing. Finally, we introduce an operator distillation technique to distill the trained model for efficient inference. SINO achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple PDE benchmarks, demonstrating strong discretization invariance and robust generalization to out-of-distribution initial conditions. To our knowledge, SINO is the first physics-aware method capable of accurately simulating globally coupled systems (e.g., the Navier-Stokes equations) from limited data without any explicit PDE terms.</description>

      <title>Concentration Distribution Learning from Label Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is an effective method to predict the relative label description degree (a.k.a. label distribution) of a sample. However, the label distribution is not a complete representation of an instance because it overlooks the absolute intensity of each label. Specifically, it's impossible to obtain the total description degree of hidden labels that not in the label space, which leads to the loss of information and confusion in instances. To solve the above problem, we come up with a new concept named background concentration to serve as the absolute description degree term of the label distribution and introduce it into the LDL process, forming the improved paradigm of concentration distribution learning. Moreover, we propose a novel model by probabilistic methods and neural networks to learn label distributions and background concentrations from existing LDL datasets. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed approach is able to extract background concentrations from label distributions while producing more accurate prediction results than the state-of-the-art LDL methods. The code is available in https://github.com/seutjw/CDL-LD.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Federated Learning: Fairness for Whom?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness in federated learning has emerged as a rapidly growing area of research, with numerous works proposing formal definitions and algorithmic interventions. Yet, despite this technical progress, fairness in FL is often defined and evaluated in ways that abstract away from the sociotechnical contexts in which these systems are deployed. In this paper, we argue that existing approaches tend to optimize narrow system level metrics, such as performance parity or contribution-based rewards, while overlooking how harms arise throughout the FL lifecycle and how they impact diverse stakeholders. We support this claim through a critical analysis of the literature, based on a systematic annotation of papers for their fairness definitions, design decisions, evaluation practices, and motivating use cases. Our analysis reveals five recurring pitfalls: 1) fairness framed solely through the lens of server client architecture, 2) a mismatch between simulations and motivating use-cases and contexts, 3) definitions that conflate protecting the system with protecting its users, 4) interventions that target isolated stages of the lifecycle while neglecting upstream and downstream effects, 5) and a lack of multi-stakeholder alignment where multiple fairness definitions can be relevant at once. Building on these insights, we propose a harm centered framework that links fairness definitions to concrete risks and stakeholder vulnerabilities. We conclude with recommendations for more holistic, context-aware, and accountable fairness research in FL.</description>

      <title>CellCLAT: Preserving Topology and Trimming Redundancy in Self-Supervised Cellular Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised topological deep learning (TDL) represents a nascent but underexplored area with significant potential for modeling higher-order interactions in simplicial complexes and cellular complexes to derive representations of unlabeled graphs. Compared to simplicial complexes, cellular complexes exhibit greater expressive power. However, the advancement in self-supervised learning for cellular TDL is largely hindered by two core challenges: \textit{extrinsic structural constraints} inherent to cellular complexes, and intrinsic semantic redundancy in cellular representations. The first challenge highlights that traditional graph augmentation techniques may compromise the integrity of higher-order cellular interactions, while the second underscores that topological redundancy in cellular complexes potentially diminish task-relevant information. To address these issues, we introduce Cellular Complex Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Trimming (CellCLAT), a twofold framework designed to adhere to the combinatorial constraints of cellular complexes while mitigating informational redundancy. Specifically, we propose a parameter perturbation-based augmentation method that injects controlled noise into cellular interactions without altering the underlying cellular structures, thereby preserving cellular topology during contrastive learning. Additionally, a cellular trimming scheduler is employed to mask gradient contributions from task-irrelevant cells through a bi-level meta-learning approach, effectively removing redundant topological elements while maintaining critical higher-order semantics. We provide theoretical justification and empirical validation to demonstrate that CellCLAT achieves substantial improvements over existing self-supervised graph learning methods, marking a significant attempt in this domain.</description>

      <title>Pioneering 4-Bit FP Quantization for Diffusion Models: Mixup-Sign Quantization and Timestep-Aware Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model quantization reduces the bit-width of weights and activations, improving memory efficiency and inference speed in diffusion models. However, achieving 4-bit quantization remains challenging. Existing methods, primarily based on integer quantization and post-training quantization fine-tuning, struggle with inconsistent performance. Inspired by the success of floating-point (FP) quantization in large language models, we explore low-bit FP quantization for diffusion models and identify key challenges: the failure of signed FP quantization to handle asymmetric activation distributions, the insufficient consideration of temporal complexity in the denoising process during fine-tuning, and the misalignment between fine-tuning loss and quantization error. To address these challenges, we propose the mixup-sign floating-point quantization (MSFP) framework, first introducing unsigned FP quantization in model quantization, along with timestep-aware LoRA (TALoRA) and denoising-factor loss alignment (DFA), which ensure precise and stable fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that we are the first to achieve superior performance in 4-bit FP quantization for diffusion models, outperforming existing PTQ fine-tuning methods in 4-bit INT quantization.</description>

      <title>Relevance-driven Input Dropout: an Explanation-guided Regularization Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overfitting is a well-known issue extending even to state-of-the-art (SOTA) Machine Learning (ML) models, resulting in reduced generalization, and a significant train-test performance gap. Mitigation measures include a combination of dropout, data augmentation, weight decay, and other regularization techniques. Among the various data augmentation strategies, occlusion is a prominent technique that typically focuses on randomly masking regions of the input during training. Most of the existing literature emphasizes randomness in selecting and modifying the input features instead of regions that strongly influence model decisions. We propose Relevance-driven Input Dropout (RelDrop), a novel data augmentation method which selectively occludes the most relevant regions of the input, nudging the model to use other important features in the prediction process, thus improving model generalization through informed regularization. We further conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses to study how Relevance-driven Input Dropout (RelDrop) affects model decision-making. Through a series of experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our approach improves robustness towards occlusion, results in models utilizing more features within the region of interest, and boosts inference time generalization performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Shreyas-Gururaj/LRP_Relevance_Dropout.</description>

      <title>SOSBENCH: Benchmarking Safety Alignment on Scientific Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advancing capabilities in complex tasks, such as reasoning and graduate-level question answering, yet their resilience against misuse, particularly involving scientifically sophisticated risks, remains underexplored. Existing safety benchmarks typically focus either on instructions requiring minimal knowledge comprehension (e.g., ``tell me how to build a bomb") or utilize prompts that are relatively low-risk (e.g., multiple-choice or classification tasks about hazardous content). Consequently, they fail to adequately assess model safety when handling knowledge-intensive, hazardous scenarios.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce SOSBench, a regulation-grounded, hazard-focused benchmark encompassing six high-risk scientific domains: chemistry, biology, medicine, pharmacology, physics, and psychology. The benchmark comprises 3,000 prompts derived from real-world regulations and laws, systematically expanded via an LLM-assisted evolutionary pipeline that introduces diverse, realistic misuse scenarios (e.g., detailed explosive synthesis instructions involving advanced chemical formulas). We evaluate frontier models within a unified evaluation framework using our SOSBench. Despite their alignment claims, advanced models consistently disclose policy-violating content across all domains, demonstrating alarmingly high rates of harmful responses (e.g., 79.1% for Deepseek-R1 and 47.3% for GPT-4.1). These results highlight significant safety alignment deficiencies and underscore urgent concerns regarding the responsible deployment of powerful LLMs.</description>

      <title>Learning Where to Learn: Training Distribution Selection for Provable OOD Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Models trained on one data distribution often experience substantial performance degradation when evaluated on shifted or unseen domains. To address this challenge, the present paper studies the design of training data distributions that maximize average-case OOD performance. First, a theoretical analysis establishes a family of generalization bounds that quantify how the choice of training distribution influences OOD error across a predefined family of target distributions. These insights motivate the introduction of two complementary algorithmic strategies: (i) directly formulating OOD risk minimization as a bilevel optimization problem over the space of probability measures and (ii) minimizing a theoretical upper bound on OOD error. Last, the paper evaluates the two approaches across a range of function approximation and operator learning examples. The proposed methods significantly improve OOD accuracy over standard empirical risk minimization with a fixed distribution. These results highlight the potential of distribution-aware training as a principled and practical framework for robust OOD generalization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and inverse optimization (IO) for Markov decision processes (MDPs) has been relatively underexplored in the literature, despite addressing the same problem. In this work, we revisit the relationship between the IO framework for MDPs, IRL, and apprenticeship learning (AL). We incorporate prior beliefs on the structure of the cost function into the IRL and AL problems, and demonstrate that the convex-analytic view of the AL formalism (Kamoutsi et al., 2021) emerges as a relaxation of our framework. Notably, the AL formalism is a special case in our framework when the regularization term is absent. Focusing on the suboptimal expert setting, we formulate the AL problem as a regularized min-max problem. The regularizer plays a key role in addressing the ill-posedness of IRL by guiding the search for plausible cost functions. To solve the resulting regularized-convex-concave-min-max problem, we use stochastic mirror descent (SMD) and establish convergence bounds for the proposed method. Numerical experiments highlight the critical role of regularization in learning cost vectors and apprentice policies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Diffusion Models for Symmetric Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for designing efficient diffusion models for $d$-dimensional symmetric-space Riemannian manifolds, including the torus, sphere, special orthogonal group and unitary group. Existing manifold diffusion models often depend on heat kernels, which lack closed-form expressions and require either $d$ gradient evaluations or exponential-in-$d$ arithmetic operations per training step. We introduce a new diffusion model for symmetric manifolds with a spatially-varying covariance, allowing us to leverage a projection of Euclidean Brownian motion to bypass heat kernel computations. Our training algorithm minimizes a novel efficient objective derived via Ito's Lemma, allowing each step to run in $O(1)$ gradient evaluations and nearly-linear-in-$d$ ($O(d^{1.19})$) arithmetic operations, reducing the gap between diffusions on symmetric manifolds and Euclidean space. Manifold symmetries ensure the diffusion satisfies an "average-case" Lipschitz condition, enabling accurate and efficient sample generation. Empirically, our model outperforms prior methods in training speed and improves sample quality on synthetic datasets on the torus, special orthogonal group, and unitary group.</description>

      <title>PrivATE: Differentially Private Confidence Intervals for Average Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The average treatment effect (ATE) is widely used to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs and other medical interventions. In safety-critical applications like medicine, reliable inferences about the ATE typically require valid uncertainty quantification, such as through confidence intervals (CIs). However, estimating treatment effects in these settings often involves sensitive data that must be kept private. In this work, we present PrivATE, a novel machine learning framework for computing CIs for the ATE under differential privacy. Specifically, we focus on deriving valid privacy-preserving CIs for the ATE from observational data. Our PrivATE framework consists of three steps: (i) estimating a differentially private ATE through output perturbation; (ii) estimating the differentially private variance through a truncated output perturbation mechanism; and (iii) constructing the CIs while accounting for the uncertainty from both the estimation and privatization steps. Our PrivATE framework is model agnostic, doubly robust, and ensures valid CIs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using synthetic and real-world medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to derive a general, doubly robust framework for valid CIs of the ATE under ($\varepsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy.</description>

      <title>AutoSGD: Automatic Learning Rate Selection for Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The learning rate is an important tuning parameter for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and can greatly influence its performance. However, appropriate selection of a learning rate schedule across all iterations typically requires a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort. To address this, we introduce AutoSGD: an SGD method that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate at a given iteration and then takes appropriate action. We introduce theory supporting the convergence of AutoSGD, along with its deterministic counterpart for standard gradient descent. Empirical results suggest strong performance of the method on a variety of traditional optimization problems and machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>PreGenie: An Agentic Framework for High-quality Visual Presentation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual presentations are vital for effective communication. Early attempts to automate their creation using deep learning often faced issues such as poorly organized layouts, inaccurate text summarization, and a lack of image understanding, leading to mismatched visuals and text. These limitations restrict their application in formal contexts like business and scientific research. To address these challenges, we propose PreGenie, an agentic and modular framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for generating high-quality visual presentations.
  PreGenie is built on the Slidev presentation framework, where slides are rendered from Markdown code. It operates in two stages: (1) Analysis and Initial Generation, which summarizes multimodal input and generates initial code, and (2) Review and Re-generation, which iteratively reviews intermediate code and rendered slides to produce final, high-quality presentations. Each stage leverages multiple MLLMs that collaborate and share information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PreGenie excels in multimodal understanding, outperforming existing models in both aesthetics and content consistency, while aligning more closely with human design preferences.</description>

      <title>Efficient Controllable Diffusion via Optimal Classifier Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The controllable generation of diffusion models aims to steer the model to generate samples that optimize some given objective functions. It is desirable for a variety of applications including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/sequence generation. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based fine-tuning of the base model is a popular approach but it can overfit the reward function while requiring significant resources. We frame controllable generation as a problem of finding a distribution that optimizes a KL-regularized objective function. We present SLCD -- Supervised Learning based Controllable Diffusion, which iteratively generates online data and trains a small classifier to guide the generation of the diffusion model. Similar to the standard classifier-guided diffusion, SLCD's key computation primitive is classification and does not involve any complex concepts from RL or control. Via a reduction to no-regret online learning analysis, we show that under KL divergence, the output from SLCD provably converges to the optimal solution of the KL-regularized objective. Further, we empirically demonstrate that SLCD can generate high quality samples with nearly the same inference time as the base model in both image generation with continuous diffusion and biological sequence generation with discrete diffusion.

      <title>What happens when generative AI models train recursively on each others' generated outputs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internet is full of AI-generated content while also serving as a common source of training data for generative AI (genAI) models. This duality raises the possibility that future genAI models may be trained on other models' generated outputs. Prior work has studied consequences of models training on their own generated outputs, but limited work has considered what happens if models ingest content produced by other models. Given society's increasing dependence on genAI tools, understanding downstream effects of such data-mediated model interactions is critical. To this end, we provide empirical evidence for how data-mediated interactions might unfold in practice, develop a theoretical model for this interactive training process, and show experimentally possible long-term results of such interactions. We find that data-mediated interactions can benefit models by exposing them to novel concepts perhaps missed in original training data, but also can homogenize their performance on shared tasks.</description>

      <title>multivariateGPT: a decoder-only transformer for multivariate categorical and numeric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world processes often generate data that are a mix of categorical and numeric values that are recorded at irregular and informative intervals. Discrete token-based approaches are limited in numeric representation capacity while methods like neural ordinary differential equations are not well suited for categorical data or informative sampling and require augmentation to handle certain classes of trajectories. Here, we present multivariateGPT, a single architecture for modeling sequences of mixed categorical (including tokenized text) and numeric data. This is accomplished with an autoregressive sequence decomposition, embedding scheme, and loss function that extend the next token prediction task to likelihood estimation of the joint distribution of next token class and value. We demonstrate how this approach can efficiently learn to generalize patterns in simple physical systems and model complex time series including electrocardiograms and multivariate electronic health record data. This work extends the utility of transformer based models to additional classes of data.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Permissionless Distributed Learning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an incentive system for distributed deep learning of foundational models where peers are rewarded for contributions. The incentive system, \textit{Gauntlet}, has been deployed on the bittensor blockchain and used to train a 1.2B LLM with completely permissionless contributions of pseudo-gradients: no control over the users that can register or their hardware. \textit{Gauntlet} can be applied to any synchronous distributed training scheme that relies on aggregating updates or pseudo-gradients. We rely on a two-stage mechanism for fast filtering of peer uptime, reliability, and synchronization, combined with the core component that estimates the loss before and after individual pseudo-gradient contributions. We utilized an OpenSkill rating system to track competitiveness of pseudo-gradient scores across time. Finally, we introduce a novel mechanism to ensure peers on the network perform unique computations. Our live 1.2B run, which has paid out real-valued tokens to participants based on the value of their contributions, yielded a competitive (on a per-iteration basis) 1.2B model that demonstrates the utility of our incentive system.</description>

      <title>AMSFL: Adaptive Multi-Step Federated Learning via Gradient Difference-Based Error Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning faces critical challenges in balancing communication efficiency and model accuracy. One key issue lies in the approximation of update errors without incurring high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a lightweight yet effective method called Gradient Difference Approximation (GDA), which leverages first-order information to estimate local error trends without computing the full Hessian matrix. The proposed method forms a key component of the Adaptive Multi-Step Federated Learning (AMSFL) framework and provides a unified error modeling strategy for large-scale multi-step adaptive training environments.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance Networks for Efficient Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a \textit{nonlinear} recurrent model that processes long sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the state-transition matrix to be diagonal and learned at every step, the full sequence can be solved in parallel with a single prefix-scan, giving $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover, LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Lastly, for network depth $L$, as the forward and backward passes cost $\Theta(T\,D\,L)$ FLOPs, with its low sequential depth and parameter count $\Theta(D\,L)$, the model follows the compute-optimal scaling law regime ($\beta \approx 0.42$) recently observed for Mamba, outperforming quadratic-attention Transformers at equal compute while avoiding the memory overhead of FFT-based long convolutions. We show that on a series of long-range forecasting tasks, LrcSSM outperforms LRU, S5 and Mamba.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a deep ReLU network is initialized with small weights, GD is at first dominated by the saddle at the origin in parameter space. We study the so-called escape directions, which play a similar role as the eigenvectors of the Hessian for strict saddles. We show that the optimal escape direction features a low-rank bias in its deeper layers: the first singular value of the $\ell$-th layer weight matrix is at least $\ell^{\frac{1}{4}}$ larger than any other singular value. We also prove a number of related results about these escape directions. We argue that this result is a first step in proving Saddle-to-Saddle dynamics in deep ReLU networks, where GD visits a sequence of saddles with increasing bottleneck rank.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents are not even close to Human Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents achieve impressive results in a wide variety of tasks, but they lack zero-shot adaptation capabilities. While most robustness evaluations focus on tasks complexifications, for which human also struggle to maintain performances, no evaluation has been performed on tasks simplifications. To tackle this issue, we introduce HackAtari, a set of task variations of the Arcade Learning Environments. We use it to demonstrate that, contrary to humans, RL agents systematically exhibit huge performance drops on simpler versions of their training tasks, uncovering agents' consistent reliance on shortcuts. Our analysis across multiple algorithms and architectures highlights the persistent gap between RL agents and human behavioral intelligence, underscoring the need for new benchmarks and methodologies that enforce systematic generalization testing beyond static evaluation protocols. Training and testing in the same environment is not enough to obtain agents equipped with human-like intelligence.</description>

      <title>LaX: Boosting Low-Rank Training of Foundation Models via Latent Crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training foundation models such as ViTs and LLMs requires tremendous computing cost. Low-rank matrix or tensor factorization offers a parameter-efficient alternative, but often downgrades performance due to the restricted parameter space. In this work, we introduce {\textbf{Latent Crossing (LaX)}} -- a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that enhances the capacity of low-rank models by enabling information flow across low-rank subspaces. We extensively validate the benefits of LaX on pre-training tasks with ViT-Base/Large and LLaMA-like models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. LaX boosts low-rank model performance to match or exceed the full-rank baselines while using 2-3\(\times\) fewer parameters. When equipped with low-rank adapters (i.e., LoRA) for fine-tuning LLaMA-7/13B, LaX consistently improves performance on arithmetic and common sense reasoning tasks with negligible cost.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Unseen: Crash Prediction Must Learn from What Did Not Happen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic safety science has long been hindered by a fundamental data paradox: the crashes we most wish to prevent are precisely those events we rarely observe. Existing crash-frequency models and surrogate safety metrics rely heavily on sparse, noisy, and under-reported records, while even sophisticated, high-fidelity simulations undersample the long-tailed situations that trigger catastrophic outcomes such as fatalities. We argue that the path to achieving Vision Zero, i.e., the complete elimination of traffic fatalities and severe injuries, requires a paradigm shift from traditional crash-only learning to a new form of counterfactual safety learning: reasoning not only about what happened, but also about the vast set of plausible yet perilous scenarios that could have happened under slightly different circumstances. To operationalize this shift, our proposed agenda bridges macro to micro. Guided by crash-rate priors, generative scene engines, diverse driver models, and causal learning, near-miss events are synthesized and explained. A crash-focused digital twin testbed links micro scenes to macro patterns, while a multi-objective validator ensures that simulations maintain statistical realism. This pipeline transforms sparse crash data into rich signals for crash prediction, enabling the stress-testing of vehicles, roads, and policies before deployment. By learning from crashes that almost happened, we can shift traffic safety from reactive forensics to proactive prevention, advancing Vision Zero.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Bi-Linear State Transitions in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of hidden units in recurrent neural networks is typically seen as modeling memory, with research focusing on enhancing information retention through gating mechanisms. A less explored perspective views hidden units as active participants in the computation performed by the network, rather than passive memory stores. In this work, we revisit bi-linear operations, which involve multiplicative interactions between hidden units and input embeddings. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that they constitute a natural inductive bias for representing the evolution of hidden states in state tracking tasks. These are the simplest type of task that require hidden units to actively contribute to the behavior of the network. We also show that bi-linear state updates form a natural hierarchy corresponding to state tracking tasks of increasing complexity, with popular linear recurrent networks such as Mamba residing at the lowest-complexity center of that hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Uncertainty-Guided Diffusional Subgoals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) learns to make decisions on multiple levels of temporal abstraction. A key challenge in HRL is that the low-level policy changes over time, making it difficult for the high-level policy to generate effective subgoals. To address this issue, the high-level policy must capture a complex subgoal distribution while also accounting for uncertainty in its estimates. We propose an approach that trains a conditional diffusion model regularized by a Gaussian Process (GP) prior to generate a complex variety of subgoals while leveraging principled GP uncertainty quantification. Building on this framework, we develop a strategy that selects subgoals from both the diffusion policy and GP's predictive mean. Our approach outperforms prior HRL methods in both sample efficiency and performance on challenging continuous control benchmarks.</description>

      <title>DualSchool: How Reliable are LLMs for Optimization Education?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following task taught in introductory optimization courses which addresses challenges articulated by the community at the intersection of (generative) AI and OR: generate the dual of a linear program. LLMs, being trained at web-scale, have the conversion process and many instances of Primal to Dual Conversion (P2DC) at their disposal. Students may thus reasonably expect that LLMs would perform well on the P2DC task. To assess this expectation, this paper introduces DualSchool, a comprehensive framework for generating and verifying P2DC instances. The verification procedure of DualSchool uses the Canonical Graph Edit Distance, going well beyond existing evaluation methods for optimization models, which exhibit many false positives and negatives when applied to P2DC. Experiments performed by DualSchool reveal interesting findings. Although LLMs can recite the conversion procedure accurately, state-of-the-art open LLMs fail to consistently produce correct duals. This finding holds even for the smallest two-variable instances and for derivative tasks, such as correctness, verification, and error classification. The paper also discusses the implications for educators, students, and the development of large reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Memorization to Generalization: Emergence of Diffusion Models from Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.</description>

      <title>P-DROP: Poisson-Based Dropout for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-smoothing remains a major challenge in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where repeated message passing causes node representations to converge and lose discriminative power. To address this, we propose a novel node selection strategy based on Poisson processes, introducing stochastic but structure-aware updates. Specifically, we equip each node with an independent Poisson clock, enabling asynchronous and localized updates that preserve structural diversity. We explore two applications of this strategy: as a replacement for dropout-based regularization and as a dynamic subgraph training scheme. Experimental results on standard benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) demonstrate that our Poisson-based method yields competitive or improved accuracy compared to traditional Dropout, DropEdge, and DropNode approaches, particularly in later training stages.</description>

      <title>Born a Transformer -- Always a Transformer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have theoretical limitations in modeling certain sequence-to-sequence tasks, yet it remains largely unclear if these limitations play a role in large-scale pretrained LLMs, or whether LLMs might effectively overcome these constraints in practice due to the scale of both the models themselves and their pretraining data. We explore how these architectural constraints manifest after pretraining, by studying a family of $\textit{retrieval}$ and $\textit{copying}$ tasks inspired by Liu et al. [2024]. We use the recently proposed C-RASP framework for studying length generalization [Huang et al., 2025b] to provide guarantees for each of our settings. Empirically, we observe an $\textit{induction-versus-anti-induction}$ asymmetry, where pretrained models are better at retrieving tokens to the right (induction) rather than the left (anti-induction) of a query token. This asymmetry disappears upon targeted fine-tuning if length-generalization is guaranteed by theory. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this asymmetry is connected to the differences in the strength of induction versus anti-induction circuits within pretrained Transformers. We validate our findings through practical experiments on real-world tasks demonstrating reliability risks. Our results highlight that pretraining selectively enhances certain Transformer capabilities, but does not overcome fundamental length-generalization limits.</description>

      <title>Faster Rates for Private Adversarial Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design new differentially private algorithms for the problems of adversarial bandits and bandits with expert advice. For adversarial bandits, we give a simple and efficient conversion of any non-private bandit algorithm to a private bandit algorithm. Instantiating our conversion with existing non-private bandit algorithms gives a regret upper bound of $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\right)$, improving upon the existing upper bound $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT \log(KT)}}{\epsilon}\right)$ for all $\epsilon \leq 1$. In particular, our algorithms allow for sublinear expected regret even when $\epsilon \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}$, establishing the first known separation between central and local differential privacy for this problem. For bandits with expert advice, we give the first differentially private algorithms, with expected regret $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{NT}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\right), O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT\log(N)}\log(KT)}{\epsilon}\right)$, and $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{N^{1/6}K^{1/2}T^{2/3}\log(NT)}{\epsilon ^{1/3}} + \frac{N^{1/2}\log(NT)}{\epsilon}\right)$, where $K$ and $N$ are the number of actions and experts respectively. These rates allow us to get sublinear regret for different combinations of small and large $K, N$ and $\epsilon.$</description>

      <title>Multimodal Federated Learning: A Survey through the Lens of Different FL Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) lies at the intersection of two pivotal research areas: leveraging complementary information from multiple modalities to improve downstream inference performance and enabling distributed training to enhance efficiency and preserve privacy. Despite the growing interest in MFL, there is currently no comprehensive taxonomy that organizes MFL through the lens of different Federated Learning (FL) paradigms. This perspective is important because multimodal data introduces distinct challenges across various FL settings. These challenges, including modality heterogeneity, privacy heterogeneity, and communication inefficiency, are fundamentally different from those encountered in traditional unimodal or non-FL scenarios. In this paper, we systematically examine MFL within the context of three major FL paradigms: horizontal FL (HFL), vertical FL (VFL), and hybrid FL. For each paradigm, we present the problem formulation, review representative training algorithms, and highlight the most prominent challenge introduced by multimodal data in distributed settings. We also discuss open challenges and provide insights for future research. By establishing this taxonomy, we aim to uncover the novel challenges posed by multimodal data from the perspective of different FL paradigms and to offer a new lens through which to understand and advance the development of MFL.</description>

      <title>From Directions to Cones: Exploring Multidimensional Representations of Propositional Facts in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong conversational abilities but often generate falsehoods. Prior work suggests that the truthfulness of simple propositions can be represented as a single linear direction in a model's internal activations, but this may not fully capture its underlying geometry. In this work, we extend the concept cone framework, recently introduced for modeling refusal, to the domain of truth. We identify multi-dimensional cones that causally mediate truth-related behavior across multiple LLM families. Our results are supported by three lines of evidence: (i) causal interventions reliably flip model responses to factual statements, (ii) learned cones generalize across model architectures, and (iii) cone-based interventions preserve unrelated model behavior. These findings reveal the richer, multidirectional structure governing simple true/false propositions in LLMs and highlight concept cones as a promising tool for probing abstract behaviors.</description>

      <title>Towards Operational Automated Greenhouse Gas Plume Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operational deployment of a fully automated greenhouse gas (GHG) plume detection system remains an elusive goal for imaging spectroscopy missions, despite recent advances in deep learning approaches. With the dramatic increase in data availability, however, automation continues to increase in importance for natural and anthropogenic emissions monitoring. This work reviews and addresses several key obstacles in the field: data and label quality control, prevention of spatiotemporal biases, and correctly aligned modeling objectives. We demonstrate through rigorous experiments using multicampaign data from airborne and spaceborne instruments that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to achieve operational detection performance when these obstacles are alleviated. We demonstrate that a multitask model that learns both instance detection and pixelwise segmentation simultaneously can successfully lead towards an operational pathway. We evaluate the model's plume detectability across emission source types and regions, identifying thresholds for operational deployment. Finally, we provide analysis-ready data, models, and source code for reproducibility, and work to define a set of best practices and validation standards to facilitate future contributions to the field.</description>

      <title>TabReason: A Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Reasoning LLM for Explainable Tabular Data Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive modeling on tabular data is the cornerstone of many real-world applications. Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data. Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only toward high prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons for its predictions. Experimental results show that our model achieves promising performance on financial benchmark datasets, outperforming most existing LLMs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Data Augmentation through Bayesian Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data Augmentation (DA) has become an essential tool to improve robustness and generalization of modern machine learning. However, when deciding on DA strategies it is critical to choose parameters carefully, and this can be a daunting task which is traditionally left to trial-and-error or expensive optimization based on validation performance. In this paper, we counter these limitations by proposing a novel framework for optimizing DA. In particular, we take a probabilistic view of DA, which leads to the interpretation of augmentation parameters as model (hyper)-parameters, and the optimization of the marginal likelihood with respect to these parameters as a Bayesian model selection problem. Due to its intractability, we derive a tractable Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO), which allows us to optimize augmentation parameters jointly with model parameters. We provide extensive theoretical results on variational approximation quality, generalization guarantees, invariance properties, and connections to empirical Bayes. Through experiments on computer vision tasks, we show that our approach improves calibration and yields robust performance over fixed or no augmentation. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for optimizing DA through Bayesian principles with significant potential for robust machine learning.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Latent Pattern Analysis for Estimating Type 2 Diabetes Risk in Undiagnosed Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global prevalence of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is rapidly increasing, posing significant health and economic challenges. T2DM not only disrupts blood glucose regulation but also damages vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, and blood vessels, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. In the US alone, the economic burden of diagnosed diabetes exceeded \$400 billion in 2022. Early detection of individuals at risk is critical to mitigating these impacts. While machine learning approaches for T2DM prediction are increasingly adopted, many rely on supervised learning, which is often limited by the lack of confirmed negative cases. To address this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised framework that integrates Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with statistical techniques to identify individuals at risk of developing T2DM. Our method identifies latent patterns of multimorbidity and polypharmacy among diagnosed T2DM patients and applies these patterns to estimate the T2DM risk in undiagnosed individuals. By leveraging data-driven insights from comorbidity and medication usage, our approach provides an interpretable and scalable solution that can assist healthcare providers in implementing timely interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and potentially reducing the future health and economic burden of T2DM.</description>

      <title>Let Me Think! A Long Chain-of-Thought Can Be Worth Exponentially Many Short Ones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time computation has emerged as a promising scaling axis for improving large language model reasoning. However, despite yielding impressive performance, the optimal allocation of inference-time computation remains poorly understood. A central question is whether to prioritize sequential scaling (e.g., longer chains of thought) or parallel scaling (e.g., majority voting across multiple short chains of thought). In this work, we seek to illuminate the landscape of test-time scaling by demonstrating the existence of reasoning settings where sequential scaling offers an exponential advantage over parallel scaling. These settings are based on graph connectivity problems in challenging distributions of graphs. We validate our theoretical findings with comprehensive experiments across a range of language models, including models trained from scratch for graph connectivity with different chain of thought strategies as well as large reasoning models.</description>

      <title>In Search of Adam's Secret Sauce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the remarkable efficacy of Adam when training transformer-based language models has become a central research topic within the optimization community. To gain deeper insights, several simplifications of Adam have been proposed, such as the signed gradient and signed momentum methods. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study - training over 1,300 language models across different data configurations and scales - comparing Adam to several known simplified variants. We find that signed momentum methods are faster than SGD, but consistently underperform relative to Adam, even after careful tuning of momentum, clipping setting and learning rates. However, our analysis reveals a compelling option that preserves near-optimal performance while allowing for new insightful reformulations: constraining the Adam momentum parameters to be equal. Beyond robust performance, this choice affords new theoretical insights, highlights the "secret sauce" on top of signed momentum, and grants a precise statistical interpretation: we show that Adam in this setting implements a natural online algorithm for estimating the mean and variance of gradients-one that arises from a mean-field Gaussian variational inference perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce model size during post-training, compression methods, including knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, and pruning, are often applied after fine-tuning the model. However, sequential fine-tuning and compression sacrifices performance, while creating a larger than necessary model as an intermediate step. In this work, we aim to reduce this gap, by directly constructing a smaller model while guided by the downstream task. We propose to jointly fine-tune and compress the model by gradually distilling it to a pruned low-rank structure. Experiments demonstrate that joint fine-tuning and compression significantly outperforms other sequential compression methods.</description>

      <title>An Optimistic Algorithm for online CMDPS with Anytime Adversarial Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online safe reinforcement learning (RL) plays a key role in dynamic environments, with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and cybersecurity. The objective is to learn optimal policies that maximize rewards while satisfying safety constraints modeled by constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). Existing methods achieve sublinear regret under stochastic constraints but often fail in adversarial settings, where constraints are unknown, time-varying, and potentially adversarially designed. In this paper, we propose the Optimistic Mirror Descent Primal-Dual (OMDPD) algorithm, the first to address online CMDPs with anytime adversarial constraints. OMDPD achieves optimal regret O(sqrt(K)) and strong constraint violation O(sqrt(K)) without relying on Slater's condition or the existence of a strictly known safe policy. We further show that access to accurate estimates of rewards and transitions can further improve these bounds. Our results offer practical guarantees for safe decision-making in adversarial environments.</description>

      <title>A Provable Approach for End-to-End Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding goal in safe reinforcement learning (RL) is a method to ensure the safety of a policy throughout the entire process, from learning to operation. However, existing safe RL paradigms inherently struggle to achieve this objective. We propose a method, called Provably Lifetime Safe RL (PLS), that integrates offline safe RL with safe policy deployment to address this challenge. Our proposed method learns a policy offline using return-conditioned supervised learning and then deploys the resulting policy while cautiously optimizing a limited set of parameters, known as target returns, using Gaussian processes (GPs). Theoretically, we justify the use of GPs by analyzing the mathematical relationship between target and actual returns. We then prove that PLS finds near-optimal target returns while guaranteeing safety with high probability. Empirically, we demonstrate that PLS outperforms baselines both in safety and reward performance, thereby achieving the longstanding goal to obtain high rewards while ensuring the safety of a policy throughout the lifetime from learning to operation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Bayesian Model Averaging in the Era of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical, full-fledged Bayesian model averaging (BMA) paradigm to ensemble pre-trained and/or lightly-finetuned foundation models to enhance the classification performance on image and text data. To make BMA tractable under foundation models, we introduce trainable linear classifiers that take frozen features from the pre-trained foundation models as inputs. The model posteriors over the linear classifiers tell us which linear heads and frozen features are better suited for a given dataset, resulting in a principled model ensembling method. Furthermore, we propose a computationally cheaper, optimizable model averaging scheme (OMA). In OMA, we directly optimize the model ensemble weights, just like those weights based on model posterior distributions in BMA, by reducing the amount of surprise (expected entropy of the predictions) we get from predictions of ensembled models. With the rapid development of foundation models, these approaches will enable the incorporation of future, possibly significantly better foundation models to enhance the performance of challenging classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Batch Normalisation: Resolving the Dilemma of Batch Normalisation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch Normalisation (BN) is widely used in conventional deep neural network training to harmonise the input-output distributions for each batch of data. However, federated learning, a distributed learning paradigm, faces the challenge of dealing with non-independent and identically distributed data among the client nodes. Due to the lack of a coherent methodology for updating BN statistical parameters, standard BN degrades the federated learning performance. To this end, it is urgent to explore an alternative normalisation solution for federated learning. In this work, we resolve the dilemma of the BN layer in federated learning by developing a customised normalisation approach, Hybrid Batch Normalisation (HBN). HBN separates the update of statistical parameters (i.e. , means and variances used for evaluation) from that of learnable parameters (i.e. , parameters that require gradient updates), obtaining unbiased estimates of global statistical parameters in distributed scenarios. In contrast with the existing solutions, we emphasise the supportive power of global statistics for federated learning. The HBN layer introduces a learnable hybrid distribution factor, allowing each computing node to adaptively mix the statistical parameters of the current batch with the global statistics. Our HBN can serve as a powerful plugin to advance federated learning performance. It reflects promising merits across a wide range of federated learning settings, especially for small batch sizes and heterogeneous data.</description>

      <title>HydraNet: Momentum-Driven State Space Duality for Multi-Granularity Tennis Tournaments Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tennis tournaments, momentum, a critical yet elusive phenomenon, reflects the dynamic shifts in performance of athletes that can decisively influence match outcomes. Despite its significance, momentum in terms of effective modeling and multi-granularity analysis across points, games, sets, and matches in tennis tournaments remains underexplored. In this study, we define a novel Momentum Score (MS) metric to quantify a player's momentum level in multi-granularity tennis tournaments, and design HydraNet, a momentum-driven state-space duality-based framework, to model MS by integrating thirty-two heterogeneous dimensions of athletes performance in serve, return, psychology and fatigue. HydraNet integrates a Hydra module, which builds upon a state-space duality (SSD) framework, capturing explicit momentum with a sliding-window mechanism and implicit momentum through cross-game state propagation. It also introduces a novel Versus Learning method to better enhance the adversarial nature of momentum between the two athletes at a macro level, along with a Collaborative-Adversarial Attention Mechanism (CAAM) for capturing and integrating intra-player and inter-player dynamic momentum at a micro level. Additionally, we construct a million-level tennis cross-tournament dataset spanning from 2012-2023 Wimbledon and 2013-2023 US Open, and validate the multi-granularity modeling capability of HydraNet for the MS metric on this dataset. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the MS metric constructed by the HydraNet framework provides actionable insights into how momentum impacts outcomes at different granularities, establishing a new foundation for momentum modeling and sports analysis. To the best of our knowledge. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/ReyJerry/HydraNet.</description>

      <title>SDPO: Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization for Stable Diffusion Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference learning has become a central technique for aligning generative models with human expectations. Recently, it has been extended to diffusion models through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, existing approaches such as Diffusion-DPO suffer from two key challenges: timestep-dependent instability, caused by a mismatch between the reverse and forward diffusion processes and by high gradient variance in early noisy timesteps, and off-policy bias arising from the mismatch between optimization and data collection policies. We begin by analyzing the reverse diffusion trajectory and observe that instability primarily occurs at early timesteps with low importance weights. To address these issues, we first propose DPO-C\&amp;M, a practical strategy that improves stability by clipping and masking uninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Building on this, we introduce SDPO (Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization), a principled framework that incorporates importance sampling into the objective to fully correct for off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during the diffusion process. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B, CogVideoX-5B, and Wan2.1-1.3B demonstrate that both methods outperform standard Diffusion-DPO, with SDPO achieving superior VBench scores, human preference alignment, and training robustness. These results highlight the importance of timestep-aware, distribution-corrected optimization in diffusion-based preference learning.</description>

      <title>Compressing Sine-Activated Low-Rank Adapters through Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, offering substantial reductions in trainable parameters by modeling updates as the product of two low-rank matrices. While effective, the low-rank constraint inherently limits representational capacity, often resulting in reduced performance compared to full-rank fine-tuning. Recent work by Ji et al. (2025) has addressed this limitation by applying a fixed-frequency sinusoidal transformation to low-rank adapters, increasing their stable rank without introducing additional parameters. This raises a crucial question: can the same sine-activated technique be successfully applied within the context of Post-Training Quantization to retain benefits even after model compression? In this paper, we investigate this question by extending the sinusoidal transformation framework to quantized LoRA adapters. We develop a theoretical analysis showing that the stable rank of a quantized adapter is tightly linked to that of its full-precision counterpart, motivating the use of such rank-enhancing functions even under quantization. Our results demonstrate that the expressivity gains from a sinusoidal non-linearity persist after quantization, yielding highly compressed adapters with negligible loss in performance. We validate our approach across a range of fine-tuning tasks for language, vision and text-to-image generation achieving significant memory savings while maintaining competitive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Out-of-Distribution Reasoning in LLMs: An Empirical Study on Diagnosis-Related Group Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes are essential for hospital reimbursement and operations but require labor-intensive assignment. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.</description>

      <title>Taming Transformer Without Using Learning Rate Warmup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling Transformer to a large scale without using some technical tricks such as learning rate warump and using an obviously lower learning rate is an extremely challenging task, and is increasingly gaining more attention. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis for the process of training Transformer and reveal the rationale behind the model crash phenomenon in the training process, termed \textit{spectral energy concentration} of ${\bW_q}^{\top} \bW_k$, which is the reason for a malignant entropy collapse, where ${\bW_q}$ and $\bW_k$ are the projection matrices for the query and the key in Transformer, respectively. To remedy this problem, motivated by \textit{Weyl's Inequality}, we present a novel optimization strategy, \ie, making the weight updating in successive steps smooth -- if the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{1}(\nabla \bW_t)}{\sigma_{1}(\bW_{t-1})}$ is larger than a threshold, we will automatically bound the learning rate to a weighted multiple of $\frac{\sigma_{1}(\bW_{t-1})}{\sigma_{1}(\nabla \bW_t)}$, where $\nabla \bW_t$ is the updating quantity in step $t$. Such an optimization strategy can prevent spectral energy concentration to only a few directions, and thus can avoid malignant entropy collapse which will trigger the model crash. We conduct extensive experiments using ViT, Swin-Transformer and GPT, showing that our optimization strategy can effectively and stably train these Transformers without using learning rate warmup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a deep learning algorithm for human activity recognition using sensor signals as input. In this study, we built a pretrained language model based on the Transformer architecture, which is widely used in natural language processing. By leveraging this pretrained model, we aimed to improve performance on the downstream task of human activity recognition. While this task can be addressed using a vanilla Transformer, we propose an enhanced n-dimensional numerical processing Transformer that incorporates three key features: embedding n-dimensional numerical data through a linear layer, binning-based pre-processing, and a linear transformation in the output layer. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed model across five different datasets. Compared to the vanilla Transformer, our model demonstrated 10%-15% improvements in accuracy.</description>

      <title>FALCON: An ML Framework for Fully Automated Layout-Constrained Analog Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing analog circuits from performance specifications is a complex, multi-stage process encompassing topology selection, parameter inference, and layout feasibility. We introduce FALCON, a unified machine learning framework that enables fully automated, specification-driven analog circuit synthesis through topology selection and layout-constrained optimization. Given a target performance, FALCON first selects an appropriate circuit topology using a performance-driven classifier guided by human design heuristics. Next, it employs a custom, edge-centric graph neural network trained to map circuit topology and parameters to performance, enabling gradient-based parameter inference through the learned forward model. This inference is guided by a differentiable layout cost, derived from analytical equations capturing parasitic and frequency-dependent effects, and constrained by design rules. We train and evaluate FALCON on a large-scale custom dataset of 1M analog mm-wave circuits, generated and simulated using Cadence Spectre across 20 expert-designed topologies. Through this evaluation, FALCON demonstrates &gt;99\% accuracy in topology inference, &lt;10\% relative error in performance prediction, and efficient layout-aware design that completes in under 1 second per instance. Together, these results position FALCON as a practical and extensible foundation model for end-to-end analog circuit design automation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Ensemble for Fine-tuning Language Models on Multiple Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an ensemble method for fine-tuning a language model to multiple datasets. Existing methods, such as quantized LoRA (QLoRA), are efficient when adapting to a single dataset. When training on multiple datasets of different tasks, a common setup in practice, it remains unclear how to design an efficient adaptation for fine-tuning language models. We propose to use an ensemble of multiple smaller adapters instead of a single adapter per task. We design an efficient algorithm that partitions $n$ datasets into $m$ groups, where $m$ is typically much smaller than $n$ in practice, and train one adapter for each group before taking a weighted combination to form the ensemble. The algorithm leverages a first-order approximation property of low-rank adaptation to quickly obtain the fine-tuning performances of dataset combinations since methods like LoRA stay close to the base model. Hence, we use the gradients of the base model to estimate its behavior during fine-tuning. Empirically, this approximation holds with less than $1\%$ error on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, leading to an estimation of true fine-tuning performances under $5\%$ error while speeding up computation compared to base fine-tuning by $105$ times. When applied to fine-tune Llama and GPT models on ten text classification tasks, our approach provides up to $10\%$ higher average test accuracy over QLoRA, with only $9\%$ more FLOPs. On a Llama model with $34$ billion parameters, an ensemble of QLoRA increases test accuracy by $3\%$ compared to QLoRA, with only $8\%$ more FLOPs.</description>

      <title>Practical Adversarial Attacks on Stochastic Bandits via Fake Data Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on stochastic bandits have traditionally relied on some unrealistic assumptions, such as per-round reward manipulation and unbounded perturbations, limiting their relevance to real-world systems. We propose a more practical threat model, Fake Data Injection, which reflects realistic adversarial constraints: the attacker can inject only a limited number of bounded fake feedback samples into the learner's history, simulating legitimate interactions. We design efficient attack strategies under this model, explicitly addressing both magnitude constraints (on reward values) and temporal constraints (on when and how often data can be injected). Our theoretical analysis shows that these attacks can mislead both Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms into selecting a target arm in nearly all rounds while incurring only sublinear attack cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our strategies, revealing significant vulnerabilities in widely used stochastic bandit algorithms under practical adversarial scenarios.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning Beyond Experience Rehearsal and Full Model Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has remained a significant challenge for deep neural networks as learning new tasks erases previously acquired knowledge, either partially or completely. Existing solutions often rely on experience rehearsal or full model surrogates to mitigate CF. While effective, these approaches introduce substantial memory and computational overhead, limiting their scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose SPARC, a scalable CL approach that eliminates the need for experience rehearsal and full-model surrogates. By effectively combining task-specific working memories and task-agnostic semantic memory for cross-task knowledge consolidation, SPARC results in a remarkable parameter efficiency, using only 6% of the parameters required by full-model surrogates. Despite its lightweight design, SPARC achieves superior performance on Seq-TinyImageNet and matches rehearsal-based methods on various CL benchmarks. Additionally, weight re-normalization in the classification layer mitigates task-specific biases, establishing SPARC as a practical and scalable solution for CL under stringent efficiency constraints.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Primal-Dual Double Block-Coordinate for Two-way Partial AUC Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-way partial AUC (TPAUC) is a critical performance metric for binary classification with imbalanced data, as it focuses on specific ranges of the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). However, stochastic algorithms for TPAUC optimization remain under-explored, with existing methods either limited to approximated TPAUC loss functions or burdened by sub-optimal complexities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two innovative stochastic primal-dual double block-coordinate algorithms for TPAUC maximization. These algorithms utilize stochastic block-coordinate updates for both the primal and dual variables, catering to both convex and non-convex settings. We provide theoretical convergence rate analyses, demonstrating significant improvements over prior approaches. Our experimental results, based on multiple benchmark datasets, validate the superior performance of our algorithms, showcasing faster convergence and better generalization. This work advances the state of the art in TPAUC optimization and offers practical tools for real-world machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>EnsemW2S: Enhancing Weak-to-Strong Generalization with Large Language Model Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly approaching and potentially surpassing human-level performance, it has become imperative to develop approaches capable of effectively supervising and enhancing these powerful models using smaller, human-level models exposed to only human-level data. We address this critical weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization challenge by proposing a novel method aimed at improving weak experts, by training on the same limited human-level data, enabling them to generalize to complex, super-human-level tasks. Our approach, called \textbf{EnsemW2S}, employs a token-level ensemble strategy that iteratively combines multiple weak experts, systematically addressing the shortcomings identified in preceding iterations. By continuously refining these weak models, we significantly enhance their collective ability to supervise stronger student models. We extensively evaluate the generalization performance of both the ensemble of weak experts and the subsequent strong student model across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. For OOD, we specifically introduce question difficulty as an additional dimension for defining distributional shifts. Our empirical results demonstrate notable improvements, achieving 4\%, and 3.2\% improvements on ID datasets and, upto 6\% and 2.28\% on OOD datasets for experts and student models respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed method in advancing W2S generalization.</description>

      <title>Judging LLMs on a Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated evaluation of free-form outputs from large language models (LLMs) is challenging because many distinct answers can be equally valid. A common practice is to use LLMs themselves as judges, but the theoretical properties of this approach are not yet well understood. We show that a geometric framework that represents both judges and candidates as points on a probability simplex can provide helpful insight on what is or is not identifiable using LLM judges. Our theoretical analysis uncovers a "phase transition" in ranking identifiability: for binary scoring systems, true rankings are identifiable even with weak judges under mild assumptions, while rankings become non-identifiable for three or more scoring levels even with infinite data, absent additional prior knowledge. This non-identifiability highlights how uncertainty in rankings stems from not only aleatoric uncertainty (i.e., inherent stochasticity in the data) but also epistemic uncertainty regarding which assumptions hold, an aspect that has received limited attention until now. To integrate both types of uncertainty, we use Bayesian inference to encode assumptions as priors and conduct sensitivity analysis of ranking estimates and credible intervals. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Bayesian inference yields more accurate rankings and substantially improves coverage rates. These results underscore the importance of taking a more holistic approach to uncertainty quantification when using LLMs as judges.</description>

      <title>BOFormer: Learning to Solve Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization via Non-Markovian RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) offers an efficient pipeline for optimizing black-box functions with the help of a Gaussian process prior and an acquisition function (AF). Recently, in the context of single-objective BO, learning-based AFs witnessed promising empirical results given its favorable non-myopic nature. Despite this, the direct extension of these approaches to multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) suffer from the \textit{hypervolume identifiability issue}, which results from the non-Markovian nature of MOBO problems. To tackle this, inspired by the non-Markovian RL literature and the success of Transformers in language modeling, we present a generalized deep Q-learning framework and propose \textit{BOFormer}, which substantiates this framework for MOBO via sequence modeling. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BOFormer constantly outperforms the benchmark rule-based and learning-based algorithms in various synthetic MOBO and real-world multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problems. We have made the source code publicly available to encourage further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Feature Generation with Transformer and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature generation is a critical step in machine learning, aiming to enhance model performance by capturing complex relationships within the data and generating meaningful new features. Traditional feature generation methods heavily rely on domain expertise and manual intervention, making the process labor-intensive and challenging to adapt to different scenarios. Although automated feature generation techniques address these issues to some extent, they often face challenges such as feature redundancy, inefficiency in feature space exploration, and limited adaptability to diverse datasets and tasks. To address these problems, we propose a Two-Stage Feature Generation (TSFG) framework, which integrates a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The encoder-decoder model in TSFG leverages the Transformer's self-attention mechanism to efficiently represent and transform features, capturing complex dependencies within the data. PPO further enhances TSFG by dynamically adjusting the feature generation strategy based on task-specific feedback, optimizing the process for improved performance and adaptability. TSFG dynamically generates high-quality feature sets, significantly improving the predictive performance of machine learning models. Experimental results demonstrate that TSFG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of feature quality and adaptability.</description>

      <title>ACE: Exploring Activation Cosine Similarity and Variance for Accurate and Calibration-Efficient LLM Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), the demand for memory and computational resources has grown significantly. Recent advances in LLM pruning aim to reduce the size and computational cost of these models. However, existing methods often suffer from either suboptimal pruning performance or low time efficiency during the pruning process. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective pruning method that simultaneously achieves high pruning performance and fast pruning speed with improved calibration efficiency. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) An activation cosine similarity loss-guided pruning metric, which considers the angular deviation of the output activation between the dense and pruned models. (2) An activation variance-guided pruning metric, which helps preserve semantic distinctions in output activations after pruning, enabling effective pruning with shorter input sequences. These two components can be readily combined to enhance LLM pruning in both accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to an 18% reduction in perplexity and up to 63% decrease in pruning time on prevalent LLMs such as LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and OPT.</description>

      <title>Learning in Compact Spaces with Approximately Normalized Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In deep learning, regularization and normalization are common solutions for challenges such as overfitting, numerical instabilities, and the increasing variance in the residual stream. An alternative approach is to force all parameters and representations to lie on a hypersphere. This removes the need for regularization and increases convergence speed, but comes with additional costs. In this work, we propose a more holistic but approximate normalization (anTransformer). Our approach constrains the norm of parameters and normalizes all representations via scalar multiplications motivated by the tight concentration of the norms of high-dimensional random vectors. When applied to GPT training, we observe a 40% faster convergence compared to models with QK normalization, with less than 3% additional runtime. Deriving scaling laws for anGPT, we found our method enables training with larger batch sizes and fewer hyperparameters, while matching the favorable scaling characteristics of classic GPT architectures.</description>

      <title>Weakly-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Imprecise Class Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success in learning effective representations, with supervised contrastive learning often outperforming self-supervised approaches. However, in real-world scenarios, data annotations are often ambiguous or inaccurate, meaning that class labels may not reliably indicate whether two examples belong to the same class. This limitation restricts the applicability of supervised contrastive learning. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of ``continuous semantic similarity'' to define positive and negative pairs. Instead of directly relying on imprecise class labels, we measure the semantic similarity between example pairs, which quantifies how closely they belong to the same category by iteratively refining weak supervisory signals. Based on this concept, we propose a graph-theoretic framework for weakly-supervised contrastive learning, where semantic similarity serves as the graph weights. Our framework is highly versatile and can be applied to many weakly-supervised learning scenarios. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments in two common settings, i.e., noisy label and partial label learning, where existing methods can be easily integrated to significantly improve performance. Theoretically, we establish an error bound for our approach, showing that it can approximate supervised contrastive learning under mild conditions. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/Speechless-10308/WSC.</description>

      <title>Detecting Undesired Process Behavior by Means of Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformance checking techniques detect undesired process behavior by comparing process executions that are recorded in event logs to desired behavior that is captured in a dedicated process model. If such models are not available, conformance checking techniques are not applicable, but organizations might still be interested in detecting undesired behavior in their processes. To enable this, existing approaches use Large Language Models (LLMs), assuming that they can learn to distinguish desired from undesired behavior through fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive and the fine-tuned LLMs often do not generalize well. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that requires neither a dedicated process model nor resource-intensive fine-tuning to detect undesired process behavior. Instead, we use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide an LLM with direct access to a knowledge base that contains both desired and undesired process behavior from other processes, assuming that the LLM can transfer this knowledge to the process at hand. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms fine-tuned LLMs in detecting undesired behavior, demonstrating that RAG is a viable alternative to resource-intensive fine-tuning, particularly when enriched with relevant context from the event log, such as frequent traces and activities.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Effects of Sample Training Orders for Large Language Models without Retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The order of training samples plays a crucial role in large language models (LLMs), significantly impacting both their external performance and internal learning dynamics. Traditional methods for investigating this effect generally require retraining the model with various sample orders, which is computationally infeasible for LLMs. In this work, we improve traditional methods by designing a retraining-free framework. By approximating Adam optimizer updates with first- and second-order Taylor expansions and utilizing random projection methods to store intermediate checkpoints, our framework can efficiently estimate model parameters for arbitrary training sample orders. Next, we apply our framework to two downstream research problems: (1) Training curriculum design for LLMs -- we base our retraining-free framework to propose a novel curriculum learning strategy that augments curriculum proposals with estimated model performances, enabling more informed sample scheduling. (2) LLMs' memorization and generalization effect analysis -- we use our retraining-free framework to estimate how the positions of training samples influence LLMs' capacity for memorization and generalization. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our retraining-free framework in reproducing the true model performances, and further demonstrate its potential in optimizing LLM training curricula and analyzing the memorization and generalization effects of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Generalized Sliced Wasserstein Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has attracted significant interest in the machine learning community, not only for its ability to define meaningful distances between probability distributions -- such as the Wasserstein distance -- but also for its formulation of OT plans. Its computational complexity remains a bottleneck, though, and slicing techniques have been developed to scale OT to large datasets. Recently, a novel slicing scheme, dubbed min-SWGG, lifts a single one-dimensional plan back to the original multidimensional space, finally selecting the slice that yields the lowest Wasserstein distance as an approximation of the full OT plan. Despite its computational and theoretical advantages, min-SWGG inherits typical limitations of slicing methods: (i) the number of required slices grows exponentially with the data dimension, and (ii) it is constrained to linear projections. Here, we reformulate min-SWGG as a bilevel optimization problem and propose a differentiable approximation scheme to efficiently identify the optimal slice, even in high-dimensional settings. We furthermore define its generalized extension for accommodating to data living on manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our approach in various applications, including gradient flows on manifolds and high-dimensional spaces, as well as a novel sliced OT-based conditional flow matching for image generation -- where fast computation of transport plans is essential.</description>

      <title>The Resurrection of the ReLU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling sophisticated activation functions within deep learning architectures has evolved into a distinct research direction. Functions such as GELU, SELU, and SiLU offer smooth gradients and improved convergence properties, making them popular choices in state-of-the-art models. Despite this trend, the classical ReLU remains appealing due to its simplicity, inherent sparsity, and other advantageous topological characteristics. However, ReLU units are prone to becoming irreversibly inactive - a phenomenon known as the dying ReLU problem - which limits their overall effectiveness. In this work, we introduce surrogate gradient learning for ReLU (SUGAR) as a novel, plug-and-play regularizer for deep architectures. SUGAR preserves the standard ReLU function during the forward pass but replaces its derivative in the backward pass with a smooth surrogate that avoids zeroing out gradients. We demonstrate that SUGAR, when paired with a well-chosen surrogate function, substantially enhances generalization performance over convolutional network architectures such as VGG-16 and ResNet-18, providing sparser activations while effectively resurrecting dead ReLUs. Moreover, we show that even in modern architectures like Conv2NeXt and Swin Transformer - which typically employ GELU - substituting these with SUGAR yields competitive and even slightly superior performance. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that advanced activation functions are necessary for optimal performance. Instead, they suggest that the conventional ReLU, particularly with appropriate gradient handling, can serve as a strong, versatile revived classic across a broad range of deep learning vision models.</description>

      <title>Can Test-time Computation Mitigate Memorization Bias in Neural Symbolic Regression?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover mathematical equations that fit given numerical data. It has been applied in various fields of scientific research, such as producing human-readable expressions that explain physical phenomena. Recently, Neural symbolic regression (NSR) methods that involve Transformers pre-trained on large-scale synthetic datasets have gained attention. While these methods offer advantages such as short inference time, they suffer from low performance, particularly when the number of input variables is large. In this study, we hypothesized that this limitation stems from the memorization bias of Transformers in symbolic regression. We conducted a quantitative evaluation of this bias in Transformers using a synthetic dataset and found that Transformers rarely generate expressions not present in the training data. Additional theoretical analysis reveals that this bias arises from the Transformer's inability to construct expressions compositionally while verifying their numerical validity. We finally examined if tailoring test-time strategies can lead to reduced memorization bias and better performance. We empirically demonstrate that providing additional information to the model at test time can significantly mitigate memorization bias. On the other hand, we also find that reducing memorization bias does not necessarily correlate with improved performance. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of NSR approaches and offer a foundation for designing more robust, generalizable symbolic regression methods.

      <title>Inclusive, Differentially Private Federated Learning for Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training clinical AI models without centralizing sensitive patient data. However, its real-world adoption is hindered by challenges related to privacy, resource constraints, and compliance. Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure, inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.</description>

      <title>The quest for the GRAph Level autoEncoder (GRALE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although graph-based learning has attracted a lot of attention, graph representation learning is still a challenging task whose resolution may impact key application fields such as chemistry or biology. To this end, we introduce GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training, applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction.</description>

      <title>BiMi Sheets: Infosheets for bias mitigation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 15 years, hundreds of bias mitigation methods have been proposed in the pursuit of fairness in machine learning (ML). However, algorithmic biases are domain-, task-, and model-specific, leading to a `portability trap': bias mitigation solutions in one context may not be appropriate in another. Thus, a myriad of design choices have to be made when creating a bias mitigation method, such as the formalization of fairness it pursues, and where and how it intervenes in the ML pipeline. This creates challenges in benchmarking and comparing the relative merits of different bias mitigation methods, and limits their uptake by practitioners.
  We propose BiMi Sheets as a portable, uniform guide to document the design choices of any bias mitigation method. This enables researchers and practitioners to quickly learn its main characteristics and to compare with their desiderata. Furthermore, the sheets' structure allow for the creation of a structured database of bias mitigation methods. In order to foster the sheets' adoption, we provide a platform for finding and creating BiMi Sheets at bimisheet.com.</description>

      <title>Oryx: a Performant and Scalable Algorithm for Many-Agent Coordination in Offline MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is achieving effective many-agent multi-step coordination in complex environments. In this work, we propose Oryx, a novel algorithm for offline cooperative MARL to directly address this challenge. Oryx adapts the recently proposed retention-based architecture Sable and combines it with a sequential form of implicit constraint Q-learning (ICQ), to develop a novel offline auto-regressive policy update scheme. This allows Oryx to solve complex coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over lengthy trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior works (SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo) covering tasks of both discrete and continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets, outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons. Finally, we introduce new datasets to push the limits of many-agent coordination in offline MARL, and demonstrate Oryx's superior ability to scale effectively in such settings. We will make all of our datasets, experimental data, and code available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Estimation for Heterophilic Graphs Through the Lens of Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While uncertainty estimation for graphs recently gained traction, most methods rely on homophily and deteriorate in heterophilic settings. We address this by analyzing message passing neural networks from an information-theoretic perspective and developing a suitable analog to data processing inequality to quantify information throughout the model's layers. In contrast to non-graph domains, information about the node-level prediction target can increase with model depth if a node's features are semantically different from its neighbors. Therefore, on heterophilic graphs, the latent embeddings of an MPNN each provide different information about the data distribution - different from homophilic settings. This reveals that considering all node representations simultaneously is a key design principle for epistemic uncertainty estimation on graphs beyond homophily. We empirically confirm this with a simple post-hoc density estimator on the joint node embedding space that provides state-of-the-art uncertainty on heterophilic graphs. At the same time, it matches prior work on homophilic graphs without explicitly exploiting homophily through post-processing.</description>

      <title>The informativeness of the gradient revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade gradient-based deep learning has revolutionized several applications. However, this rapid advancement has highlighted the need for a deeper theoretical understanding of its limitations. Research has shown that, in many practical learning tasks, the information contained in the gradient is so minimal that gradient-based methods require an exceedingly large number of iterations to achieve success. The informativeness of the gradient is typically measured by its variance with respect to the random selection of a target function from a hypothesis class.
  We use this framework and give a general bound on the variance in terms of a parameter related to the pairwise independence of the target function class and the collision entropy of the input distribution. Our bound scales as $ \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon+e^{-\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{E}_c}) $, where $ \tilde{\mathcal{O}} $ hides factors related to the regularity of the learning model and the loss function, $ \varepsilon $ measures the pairwise independence of the target function class and $\mathcal{E}_c$ is the collision entropy of the input distribution.
  To demonstrate the practical utility of our bound, we apply it to the class of Learning with Errors (LWE) mappings and high-frequency functions. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we present experiments to understand better the nature of recent deep learning-based attacks on LWE.</description>

      <title>An Augmentation-Aware Theory for Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful tool in machine learning and computer vision to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. Meanwhile, its empirical success has encouraged many theoretical studies to reveal the learning mechanisms. However, in the existing theoretical research, the role of data augmentation is still under-exploited, especially the effects of specific augmentation types. To fill in the blank, we for the first time propose an augmentation-aware error bound for self-supervised contrastive learning, showing that the supervised risk is bounded not only by the unsupervised risk, but also explicitly by a trade-off induced by data augmentation. Then, under a novel semantic label assumption, we discuss how certain augmentation methods affect the error bound. Lastly, we conduct both pixel- and representation-level experiments to verify our proposed theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Uncertainty Estimation and Interpretability via Bayesian Non-negative Decision Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks have demonstrated significant success due to their powerful expressiveness, most models struggle to meet practical requirements for uncertainty estimation. Concurrently, the entangled nature of deep neural networks leads to a multifaceted problem, where various localized explanation techniques reveal that multiple unrelated features influence the decisions, thereby undermining interpretability. To address these challenges, we develop a Bayesian Non-negative Decision Layer (BNDL), which reformulates deep neural networks as a conditional Bayesian non-negative factor analysis. By leveraging stochastic latent variables, the BNDL can model complex dependencies and provide robust uncertainty estimation. Moreover, the sparsity and non-negativity of the latent variables encourage the model to learn disentangled representations and decision layers, thereby improving interpretability. We also offer theoretical guarantees that BNDL can achieve effective disentangled learning. In addition, we developed a corresponding variational inference method utilizing a Weibull variational inference network to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables. Our experimental results demonstrate that with enhanced disentanglement capabilities, BNDL not only improves the model's accuracy but also provides reliable uncertainty estimation and improved interpretability.</description>

      <title>Pitfalls of Rule- and Model-based Verifiers -- A Case Study on Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trustworthy verifiers are essential for the success of reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR), which is the core methodology behind various large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1. In complex domains like mathematical reasoning, rule-based verifiers have been widely adopted in previous works to train strong reasoning models. However, the reliability of these verifiers and their impact on the RL training process remain poorly understood. In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as a case study and conduct a comprehensive analysis of various verifiers in both static evaluation and RL training scenarios. First, we find that current open-source rule-based verifiers often fail to recognize equivalent answers presented in different formats across multiple commonly used mathematical datasets, resulting in non-negligible false negative rates. This limitation adversely affects RL training performance and becomes more pronounced as the policy model gets stronger. Subsequently, we investigate model-based verifiers as a potential solution to address these limitations. While the static evaluation shows that model-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy, further analysis and RL training results imply that they are highly susceptible to hacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct (i.e., false positives). This vulnerability is exploited during policy model optimization, leading to artificially inflated rewards. Our findings underscore the unique risks inherent to both rule-based and model-based verifiers, aiming to offer valuable insights to develop more robust reward systems in reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>LaMM: Semi-Supervised Pre-Training of Large-Scale Materials Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) are crucial for accelerating computational materials science by surrogating density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Improving their accuracy is possible through pre-training and fine-tuning, where an NNP model is first pre-trained on a large-scale dataset and then fine-tuned on a smaller target dataset. However, this approach is computationally expensive, mainly due to the cost of DFT-based dataset labeling and load imbalances during large-scale pre-training. To address this, we propose LaMM, a semi-supervised pre-training method incorporating improved denoising self-supervised learning and a load-balancing algorithm for efficient multi-node training. We demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages a large-scale dataset of $\sim$300 million semi-labeled samples to train a single NNP model, resulting in improved fine-tuning performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Solver-Free Decision-Focused Learning for Linear Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical optimization is a fundamental tool for decision-making in a wide range of applications. However, in many real-world scenarios, the parameters of the optimization problem are not known a priori and must be predicted from contextual features. This gives rise to predict-then-optimize problems, where a machine learning model predicts problem parameters that are then used to make decisions via optimization. A growing body of work on decision-focused learning (DFL) addresses this setting by training models specifically to produce predictions that maximize downstream decision quality, rather than accuracy. While effective, DFL is computationally expensive, because it requires solving the optimization problem with the predicted parameters at each loss evaluation. In this work, we address this computational bottleneck for linear optimization problems, a common class of problems in both DFL literature and real-world applications. We propose a solver-free training method that exploits the geometric structure of linear optimization to enable efficient training with minimal degradation in solution quality. Our method is based on the insight that a solution is optimal if and only if it achieves an objective value that is at least as good as that of its adjacent vertices on the feasible polytope. Building on this, our method compares the estimated quality of the ground-truth optimal solution with that of its precomputed adjacent vertices, and uses this as loss function. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high decision quality.</description>

      <title>Optimal kernel regression bounds under energy-bounded noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-conservative uncertainty bounds are key for both assessing an estimation algorithm's accuracy and in view of downstream tasks, such as its deployment in safety-critical contexts. In this paper, we derive a tight, non-asymptotic uncertainty bound for kernel-based estimation, which can also handle correlated noise sequences. Its computation relies on a mild norm-boundedness assumption on the unknown function and the noise, returning the worst-case function realization within the hypothesis class at an arbitrary query input location. The value of this function is shown to be given in terms of the posterior mean and covariance of a Gaussian process for an optimal choice of the measurement noise covariance. By rigorously analyzing the proposed approach and comparing it with other results in the literature, we show its effectiveness in returning tight and easy-to-compute bounds for kernel-based estimates.</description>

      <title>B-XAIC Dataset: Benchmarking Explainable AI for Graph Neural Networks Using Chemical Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the reasoning behind deep learning model predictions is crucial in cheminformatics and drug discovery, where molecular design determines their properties. However, current evaluation frameworks for Explainable AI (XAI) in this domain often rely on artificial datasets or simplified tasks, employing data-derived metrics that fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios and lack a direct link to explanation faithfulness. To address this, we introduce B-XAIC, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world molecular data and diverse tasks with known ground-truth rationales for assigned labels. Through a comprehensive evaluation using B-XAIC, we reveal limitations of existing XAI methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the molecular domain. This benchmark provides a valuable resource for gaining deeper insights into the faithfulness of XAI, facilitating the development of more reliable and interpretable models.</description>

      <title>A Unified Online-Offline Framework for Co-Branding Campaign Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-branding has become a vital strategy for businesses aiming to expand market reach within recommendation systems. However, identifying effective cross-industry partnerships remains challenging due to resource imbalances, uncertain brand willingness, and ever-changing market conditions. In this paper, we provide the first systematic study of this problem and propose a unified online-offline framework to enable co-branding recommendations. Our approach begins by constructing a bipartite graph linking ``initiating'' and ``target'' brands to quantify co-branding probabilities and assess market benefits. During the online learning phase, we dynamically update the graph in response to market feedback, while striking a balance between exploring new collaborations for long-term gains and exploiting established partnerships for immediate benefits. To address the high initial co-branding costs, our framework mitigates redundant exploration, thereby enhancing short-term performance while ensuring sustainable strategic growth. In the offline optimization phase, our framework consolidates the interests of multiple sub-brands under the same parent brand to maximize overall returns, avoid excessive investment in single sub-brands, and reduce unnecessary costs associated with over-prioritizing a single sub-brand. We present a theoretical analysis of our approach, establishing a highly nontrivial sublinear regret bound for online learning in the complex co-branding problem, and enhancing the approximation guarantee for the NP-hard offline budget allocation optimization. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world co-branding datasets demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our framework, with at least 12\% improvement.</description>

      <title>Train Sparse Autoencoders Efficiently by Utilizing Features Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have demonstrated significant promise in interpreting the hidden states of language models by decomposing them into interpretable latent directions. However, training SAEs at scale remains challenging, especially when large dictionary sizes are used. While decoders can leverage sparse-aware kernels for efficiency, encoders still require computationally intensive linear operations with large output dimensions. To address this, we propose KronSAE, a novel architecture that factorizes the latent representation via Kronecker product decomposition, drastically reducing memory and computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce mAND, a differentiable activation function approximating the binary AND operation, which improves interpretability and performance in our factorized framework.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Group Relative Policy Optimization: Insights into On-Policy and Off-Policy Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in both on-policy and off-policy optimization regimes. Our motivation comes from recent work on off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which improves training stability, sampling efficiency, and memory usage. In addition, a recent analysis of GRPO suggests that estimating the advantage function with off-policy samples could be beneficial. Building on these observations, we adapt GRPO to the off-policy setting. We show that both on-policy and off-policy GRPO objectives yield an improvement in the reward. This result motivates the use of clipped surrogate objectives in the off-policy version of GRPO. We then compare the empirical performance of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards in post-training using both GRPO variants. Our results show that off-policy GRPO either significantly outperforms or performs on par with its on-policy counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel techniques in evolutionary optimization, simulation and machine learning allow for a broad analysis of domains like fluid dynamics, in which computation is expensive and flow behavior is complex. Under the term of full domain analysis we understand the ability to efficiently determine the full space of solutions in a problem domain, and analyze the behavior of those solutions in an accessible and interactive manner. The goal of full domain analysis is to deepen our understanding of domains by generating many examples of flow, their diversification, optimization and analysis. We define a formal model for full domain analysis, its current state of the art, and requirements of subcomponents. Finally, an example is given to show what we can learn by using full domain analysis. Full domain analysis, rooted in optimization and machine learning, can be a helpful tool in understanding complex systems in computational physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Versatile Cardiovascular Signal Generation with a Unified Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiography (ECG), and blood pressure (BP) are inherently correlated and complementary, together reflecting the health of cardiovascular system. However, their joint utilization in real-time monitoring is severely limited by diverse acquisition challenges from noisy wearable recordings to burdened invasive procedures. Here we propose UniCardio, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that reconstructs low-quality signals and synthesizes unrecorded signals in a unified generative framework. Its key innovations include a specialized model architecture to manage the signal modalities involved in generation tasks and a continual learning paradigm to incorporate varying modality combinations. By exploiting the complementary nature of cardiovascular signals, UniCardio clearly outperforms recent task-specific baselines in signal denoising, imputation, and translation. The generated signals match the performance of ground-truth signals in detecting abnormal health conditions and estimating vital signs, even in unseen domains, while ensuring interpretability for human experts. These advantages position UniCardio as a promising avenue for advancing AI-assisted healthcare.</description>

      <title>Transformers Pretrained on Procedural Data Contain Modular Structures for Algorithmic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretraining on large, semantically rich datasets is key for developing language models. Surprisingly, recent studies have shown that even synthetic data, generated procedurally through simple semantic-free algorithms, can yield some of the same benefits as natural language pretraining. It is unclear what specific capabilities such simple synthetic data instils in a model, where these capabilities reside in the architecture, and how they manifest within its weights. In this short paper, we identify several beneficial forms of procedural data, together with specific algorithmic reasoning skills that improve in small transformers. Our core finding is that different procedural rules instil distinct but complementary inductive structures in the model. With extensive ablations and partial-transfer experiments, we discover that these structures reside in different parts of the model. Attention layers often carry the most transferable information, but some pretraining rules impart useful structure to MLP blocks instead. Most interestingly, the structures induced by multiple rules can be composed to jointly reinforce multiple capabilities. These results suggest an exciting possibility of disentangling the acquisition of knowledge from reasoning in language models, with the goal of improving their robustness and data efficiency.</description>

      <title>From Dormant to Deleted: Tamper-Resistant Unlearning Through Weight-Space Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent unlearning methods for LLMs are vulnerable to relearning attacks: knowledge believed-to-be-unlearned re-emerges by fine-tuning on a small set of (even seemingly-unrelated) examples. We study this phenomenon in a controlled setting for example-level unlearning in vision classifiers. We make the surprising discovery that forget-set accuracy can recover from around 50% post-unlearning to nearly 100% with fine-tuning on just the retain set -- i.e., zero examples of the forget set. We observe this effect across a wide variety of unlearning methods, whereas for a model retrained from scratch excluding the forget set (gold standard), the accuracy remains at 50%. We observe that resistance to relearning attacks can be predicted by weight-space properties, specifically, $L_2$-distance and linear mode connectivity between the original and the unlearned model. Leveraging this insight, we propose a new class of methods that achieve state-of-the-art resistance to relearning attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 underscores the significant role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we present Skywork-OR1, an effective and scalable RL implementation for long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models. Building on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series, our RL approach achieves notable performance gains, increasing average accuracy across AIME24, AIME25, and LiveCodeBench from 57.8% to 72.8% (+15.0%) for the 32B model and from 43.6% to 57.5% (+13.9%) for the 7B model. Our Skywork-OR1-32B model surpasses both DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-32B on the AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks, while achieving comparable results on LiveCodeBench. The Skywork-OR1-7B and Skywork-OR1-Math-7B models demonstrate competitive reasoning capabilities among models of similar size. We perform comprehensive ablation studies on the core components of our training pipeline to validate their effectiveness. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of entropy collapse, identify key factors affecting entropy dynamics, and demonstrate that mitigating premature entropy collapse is critical for improved test performance. To support community research, we fully open-source our model weights, training code, and training datasets.</description>

      <title>Rethinking BPS: A Utility-Based Evaluation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business process simulation (BPS) is a key tool for analyzing and optimizing organizational workflows, supporting decision-making by estimating the impact of process changes. The reliability of such estimates depends on the ability of a BPS model to accurately mimic the process under analysis, making rigorous accuracy evaluation essential. However, the state-of-the-art approach to evaluating BPS models has two key limitations. First, it treats simulation as a forecasting problem, testing whether models can predict unseen future events. This fails to assess how well a model captures the as-is process, particularly when process behavior changes from train to test period. Thus, it becomes difficult to determine whether poor results stem from an inaccurate model or the inherent complexity of the data, such as unpredictable drift. Second, the evaluation approach strongly relies on Earth Mover's Distance-based metrics, which can obscure temporal patterns and thus yield misleading conclusions about simulation quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that evaluates simulation quality based on its ability to generate representative process behavior. Instead of comparing simulated logs to future real-world executions, we evaluate whether predictive process monitoring models trained on simulated data perform comparably to those trained on real data for downstream analysis tasks. Empirical results show that our framework not only helps identify sources of discrepancies but also distinguishes between model accuracy and data complexity, offering a more meaningful way to assess BPS quality.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look on Memorization in Tabular Diffusion Model: A Data-Centric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating high-quality tabular data, but they carry privacy risks by reproducing exact training samples. While prior work focuses on dataset-level augmentation to reduce memorization, little is known about which individual samples contribute most. We present the first data-centric study of memorization dynamics in tabular diffusion models. We quantify memorization for each real sample based on how many generated samples are flagged as replicas, using a relative distance ratio. Our empirical analysis reveals a heavy-tailed distribution of memorization counts: a small subset of samples contributes disproportionately to leakage, confirmed via sample-removal experiments. To understand this, we divide real samples into top- and non-top-memorized groups and analyze their training-time behaviors. We track when each sample is first memorized and monitor per-epoch memorization intensity (AUC). Memorized samples are memorized slightly earlier and show stronger signals in early training. Based on these insights, we propose DynamicCut, a two-stage, model-agnostic mitigation method: (a) rank samples by epoch-wise intensity, (b) prune a tunable top fraction, and (c) retrain on the filtered dataset. Across multiple tabular datasets and models, DynamicCut reduces memorization with minimal impact on data diversity and downstream performance. It also complements augmentation-based defenses. Furthermore, DynamicCut enables cross-model transferability: high-ranked samples identified from one model (e.g., a diffusion model) are also effective for reducing memorization when removed from others, such as GANs and VAEs.</description>

      <title>Look Within or Look Beyond? A Theoretical Comparison Between Parameter-Efficient and Full Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods achieve performance comparable to Full Fine-Tuning (FFT) while requiring significantly fewer computing resources, making it the go-to choice for researchers. We find that although PEFT can achieve competitive results on some benchmarks, its performance falls short of FFT in complex tasks, such as reasoning and instruction-based fine-tuning. In this paper, we compare the characteristics of PEFT and FFT in terms of representational capacity and robustness based on optimization theory. We theoretically demonstrate that PEFT is a strict subset of FFT. By providing theoretical upper bounds for PEFT, we show that the limited parameter space constrains the model's representational ability, making it more susceptible to perturbations. Experiments on 15 datasets encompassing classification, generation, reasoning, instruction fine-tuning tasks and 11 adversarial test sets validate our theories. We hope that these results spark further research beyond the realms of well established PEFT.

      <title>Suitability Filter: A Statistical Framework for Classifier Evaluation in Real-World Deployment Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying machine learning models in safety-critical domains poses a key challenge: ensuring reliable model performance on downstream user data without access to ground truth labels for direct validation. We propose the suitability filter, a novel framework designed to detect performance deterioration by utilizing suitability signals -- model output features that are sensitive to covariate shifts and indicative of potential prediction errors. The suitability filter evaluates whether classifier accuracy on unlabeled user data shows significant degradation compared to the accuracy measured on the labeled test dataset. Specifically, it ensures that this degradation does not exceed a pre-specified margin, which represents the maximum acceptable drop in accuracy. To achieve reliable performance evaluation, we aggregate suitability signals for both test and user data and compare these empirical distributions using statistical hypothesis testing, thus providing insights into decision uncertainty. Our modular method adapts to various models and domains. Empirical evaluations across different classification tasks demonstrate that the suitability filter reliably detects performance deviations due to covariate shift. This enables proactive mitigation of potential failures in high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Budget-Adaptive Adapter Tuning in Orthogonal Subspaces for Continual Learning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in a single end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment. To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency, achieving higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL benchmark.</description>

      <title>Multiclass Loss Geometry Matters for Generalization of Gradient Descent in Separable Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalization performance of unregularized gradient methods for separable linear classification. While previous work mostly deal with the binary case, we focus on the multiclass setting with $k$ classes and establish novel population risk bounds for Gradient Descent for loss functions that decay to zero. In this setting, we show risk bounds that reveal that convergence rates are crucially influenced by the geometry of the loss template, as formalized by Wang and Scott (2024), rather than of the loss function itself. Particularly, we establish risk upper bounds that holds for any decay rate of the loss whose template is smooth with respect to the $p$-norm. In the case of exponentially decaying losses, our results indicates a contrast between the $p=\infty$ case, where the risk exhibits a logarithmic dependence on $k$, and $p=2$ where the risk scales linearly with $k$. To establish this separation formally, we also prove a lower bound in the latter scenario, demonstrating that the polynomial dependence on $k$ is unavoidable. Central to our analysis is a novel bound on the Rademacher complexity of low-noise vector-valued linear predictors with a loss template smooth w.r.t.~general $p$-norms.</description>

      <title>Continuum-armed Bandit Optimization with Batch Pairwise Comparison Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a bandit optimization problem where the goal is to maximize a function $f(x)$ over $T$ periods for some unknown strongly concave function $f$. We consider a new pairwise comparison oracle, where the decision-maker chooses a pair of actions $(x, x')$ for a consecutive number of periods and then obtains an estimate of $f(x)-f(x')$. We show that such a pairwise comparison oracle finds important applications to joint pricing and inventory replenishment problems and network revenue management. The challenge in this bandit optimization is twofold. First, the decision-maker not only needs to determine a pair of actions $(x, x')$ but also a stopping time $n$ (i.e., the number of queries based on $(x, x')$). Second, motivated by our inventory application, the estimate of the difference $f(x)-f(x')$ is biased, which is different from existing oracles in stochastic optimization literature. To address these challenges, we first introduce a discretization technique and local polynomial approximation to relate this problem to linear bandits. Then we developed a tournament successive elimination technique to localize the discretized cell and run an interactive batched version of LinUCB algorithm on cells. We establish regret bounds that are optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we apply our proposed algorithm and analytical framework to the two operations management problems and obtain results that improve state-of-the-art results in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Directed Homophily-Aware Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in various learning tasks on graph-structured data. Nevertheless, most GNNs struggle to generalize to heterophilic neighborhoods. Additionally, many GNNs ignore the directional nature of real-world graphs, resulting in suboptimal performance on directed graphs with asymmetric structures. In this work, we propose Directed Homophily-aware Graph Neural Network (DHGNN), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by incorporating homophily-aware and direction-sensitive components. DHGNN employs a resettable gating mechanism to adaptively modulate message contributions based on homophily levels and informativeness, and a structure-aware noise-tolerant fusion module to effectively integrate node representations from the original and reverse directions. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic directed graph datasets demonstrate that DHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification and link prediction. In particular, DHGNN improves over the best baseline by up to 15.07% in link prediction. Our analysis further shows that the gating mechanism captures directional homophily gaps and fluctuating homophily across layers, providing deeper insights into message-passing behavior on complex graph structures.</description>

      <title>SplitLoRA: Balancing Stability and Plasticity in Continual Learning Through Gradient Space Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Learning requires a model to learn multiple tasks in sequence while maintaining both stability:preserving knowledge from previously learned tasks, and plasticity:effectively learning new tasks. Gradient projection has emerged as an effective and popular paradigm in CL, where it partitions the gradient space of previously learned tasks into two orthogonal subspaces: a primary subspace and a minor subspace. New tasks are learned effectively within the minor subspace, thereby reducing interference with previously acquired knowledge. However, existing Gradient Projection methods struggle to achieve an optimal balance between plasticity and stability, as it is hard to appropriately partition the gradient space. In this work, we consider a continual learning paradigm based on Low-Rank Adaptation, which has gained considerable attention due to its efficiency and wide applicability, and propose a novel approach for continual learning, called SplitLoRA. We first provide a theoretical analysis of how subspace partitioning affects model stability and plasticity. Informed by this analysis, we then introduce an effective method that derives the optimal partition of the gradient space for previously learned tasks. This approach effectively balances stability and plasticity in continual learning. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>A Divide-and-Conquer Approach for Modeling Arrival Times in Business Process Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business Process Simulation (BPS) is a critical tool for analyzing and improving organizational processes by estimating the impact of process changes. A key component of BPS is the case-arrival model, which determines the pattern of new case entries into a process. Although accurate case-arrival modeling is essential for reliable simulations, as it influences waiting and overall cycle times, existing approaches often rely on oversimplified static distributions of inter-arrival times. These approaches fail to capture the dynamic and temporal complexities inherent in organizational environments, leading to less accurate and reliable outcomes. To address this limitation, we propose Auto Time Kernel Density Estimation (AT-KDE), a divide-and-conquer approach that models arrival times of processes by incorporating global dynamics, day-of-week variations, and intraday distributional changes, ensuring both precision and scalability. Experiments conducted across 20 diverse processes demonstrate that AT-KDE is far more accurate and robust than existing approaches while maintaining sensible execution time efficiency.</description>

      <title>Train with Perturbation, Infer after Merging: A Two-Stage Framework for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to continuously acquire new knowledge from a sequence of tasks with avoiding the forgetting of learned information. However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we propose \textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\&amp;M)}, a novel continual learning framework that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, after training on each task, P\&amp;M constructs a new model by forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, we minimize the total loss increase across all tasks and derive an analytical solution for the optimal merging coefficient. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\&amp;M with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several continual learning benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Distillation of Diffusion Models for PDE-Constrained Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling physical systems in a generative manner offers several advantages, including the ability to handle partial observations, generate diverse solutions, and address both forward and inverse problems. Recently, diffusion models have gained increasing attention in the modeling of physical systems, particularly those governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, diffusion models only access noisy data $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ at intermediate steps, making it infeasible to directly enforce constraints on the clean sample $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ at each noisy level. As a workaround, constraints are typically applied to the expectation of clean samples $\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{x}_0|\boldsymbol{x}_t]$, which is estimated using the learned score network. However, imposing PDE constraints on the expectation does not strictly represent the one on the true clean data, known as Jensen's Gap. This gap creates a trade-off: enforcing PDE constraints may come at the cost of reduced accuracy in generative modeling. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc distillation approach, where PDE constraints are not injected directly into the diffusion process, but instead enforced during a post-hoc distillation stage. We term our method as Physics-Informed Distillation of Diffusion Models (PIDDM). This distillation not only facilitates single-step generation with improved PDE satisfaction, but also support both forward and inverse problem solving and reconstruction from randomly partial observation. Extensive experiments across various PDE benchmarks demonstrate that PIDDM significantly improves PDE satisfaction over several recent and competitive baselines, such as PIDM, DiffusionPDE, and ECI-sampling, with less computation overhead. Our approach can shed light on more efficient and effective strategies for incorporating physical constraints into diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Overthinking in Large Reasoning Models via Manifold Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, these models frequently exhibit a phenomenon known as overthinking during inference, characterized by excessive validation loops and redundant deliberation, leading to substantial computational overheads. In this paper, we aim to mitigate overthinking by investigating the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We first showcase that the tendency of overthinking can be effectively captured by a single direction in the model's activation space and the issue can be eased by intervening the activations along this direction. However, this efficacy soon reaches a plateau and even deteriorates as the intervention strength increases. We therefore systematically explore the activation space and find that the overthinking phenomenon is actually tied to a low-dimensional manifold, which indicates that the limited effect stems from the noises introduced by the high-dimensional steering direction. Based on this insight, we propose Manifold Steering, a novel approach that elegantly projects the steering direction onto the low-dimensional activation manifold given the theoretical approximation of the interference noise. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 distilled models validate that our method reduces output tokens by up to 71% while maintaining and even improving the accuracy on several mathematical benchmarks. Our method also exhibits robust cross-domain transferability, delivering consistent token reduction performance in code generation and knowledge-based QA tasks.

      <title>STaR-Bets: Sequential Target-Recalculating Bets for Tighter Confidence Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of confidence intervals for the mean of a bounded random variable is a classical problem in statistics with numerous applications in machine learning and virtually all scientific fields. In particular, obtaining the tightest possible confidence intervals is vital every time the sampling of the random variables is expensive. The current state-of-the-art method to construct confidence intervals is by using betting algorithms. This is a very successful approach for deriving optimal confidence sequences, even matching the rate of law of iterated logarithms. However, in the fixed horizon setting, these approaches are either sub-optimal or based on heuristic solutions with strong empirical performance but without a finite-time guarantee. Hence, no betting-based algorithm guaranteeing the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2\log\frac1\delta}{n}})$ width of the confidence intervals are known. This work bridges this gap. We propose a betting-based algorithm to compute confidence intervals that empirically outperforms the competitors. Our betting strategy uses the optimal strategy in every step (in a certain sense), whereas the standard betting methods choose a constant strategy in advance. Leveraging this fact results in strict improvements even for classical concentration inequalities, such as the ones of Hoeffding or Bernstein. Moreover, we also prove that the width of our confidence intervals is optimal up to an $1+o(1)$ factor diminishing with $n$. The code is available on~https://github.com/vvoracek/STaR-bets-confidence-interval.</description>

      <title>Scaling Reasoning without Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advances in complex reasoning tasks, yet they remain bottlenecked by two core challenges: architectural inefficiency due to reliance on Transformers, and a lack of structured fine-tuning for high-difficulty domains. We introduce \ourmodel, an attention-free language model that addresses both issues through architectural and data-centric innovations. Built on the state space dual (SSD) layers of Mamba-2, our model eliminates the need for self-attention and key-value caching, enabling fixed-memory, constant-time inference. To train it for complex reasoning, we propose a two-phase curriculum fine-tuning strategy based on the \textsc{PromptCoT} synthesis paradigm, which generates pedagogically structured problems via abstract concept selection and rationale-guided generation. On benchmark evaluations, \ourmodel-7B outperforms strong Transformer and hybrid models of comparable scale, and even surpasses the much larger Gemma3-27B by 2.6\% on AIME 24, 0.6\% on AIME 25, and 3.0\% on Livecodebench. These results highlight the potential of state space models as efficient and scalable alternatives to attention-based architectures for high-capacity reasoning.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Antenna Miniaturization: A Knowledge-Based System Integrating Quantum PSO and Predictive Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless technologies necessitates automated design frameworks to address antenna miniaturization and performance optimization within constrained development cycles. This study demonstrates a machine learning enhanced workflow integrating Quantum-Behaved Dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization (QDPSO) with ANSYS HFSS simulations to accelerate antenna design. The QDPSO algorithm autonomously optimized loop dimensions in 11.53 seconds, achieving a resonance frequency of 1.4208 GHz a 12.7 percent reduction compared to conventional 1.60 GHz designs. Machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Stacked ensembles) predicted resonance frequencies in 0.75 seconds using 936 simulation datasets, with stacked models showing superior training accuracy (R2=0.9825) and SVM demonstrating optimal validation performance (R2=0.7197). The complete design cycle, encompassing optimization, prediction, and ANSYS validation, required 12.42 minutes on standard desktop hardware (Intel i5-8500, 16GB RAM), contrasting sharply with the 50-hour benchmark of PSADEA-based approaches. This 240 times of acceleration eliminates traditional trial-and-error methods that often extend beyond seven expert-led days. The system enables precise specifications of performance targets with automated generation of fabrication-ready parameters, particularly benefiting compact consumer devices requiring rapid frequency tuning. By bridging AI-driven optimization with CAD validation, this framework reduces engineering workloads while ensuring production-ready designs, establishing a scalable paradigm for next-generation RF systems in 6G and IoT applications.</description>

      <title>SOReL and TOReL: Two Methods for Fully Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample efficiency remains a major obstacle for real world adoption of reinforcement learning (RL): success has been limited to settings where simulators provide access to essentially unlimited environment interactions, which in reality are typically costly or dangerous to obtain. Offline RL in principle offers a solution by exploiting offline data to learn a near-optimal policy before deployment. In practice, however, current offline RL methods rely on extensive online interactions for hyperparameter tuning, and have no reliable bound on their initial online performance. To address these two issues, we introduce two algorithms. Firstly, SOReL: an algorithm for safe offline reinforcement learning. Using only offline data, our Bayesian approach infers a posterior over environment dynamics to obtain a reliable estimate of the online performance via the posterior predictive uncertainty. Crucially, all hyperparameters are also tuned fully offline. Secondly, we introduce TOReL: a tuning for offline reinforcement learning algorithm that extends our information rate based offline hyperparameter tuning methods to general offline RL approaches. Our empirical evaluation confirms SOReL's ability to accurately estimate regret in the Bayesian setting whilst TOReL's offline hyperparameter tuning achieves competitive performance with the best online hyperparameter tuning methods using only offline data. Thus, SOReL and TOReL make a significant step towards safe and reliable offline RL, unlocking the potential for RL in the real world. Our implementations are publicly available: https://github.com/CWibault/sorel\_torel.</description>

      <title>Position: All Current Generative Fidelity and Diversity Metrics are Flawed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any method's development and practical application is limited by our ability to measure its reliability. The popularity of generative modeling emphasizes the importance of good synthetic data metrics. Unfortunately, previous works have found many failure cases in current metrics, for example lack of outlier robustness and unclear lower and upper bounds. We propose a list of desiderata for synthetic data metrics, and a suite of sanity checks: carefully chosen simple experiments that aim to detect specific and known generative modeling failure modes. Based on these desiderata and the results of our checks, we arrive at our position: all current generative fidelity and diversity metrics are flawed. This significantly hinders practical use of synthetic data. Our aim is to convince the research community to spend more effort in developing metrics, instead of models. Additionally, through analyzing how current metrics fail, we provide practitioners with guidelines on how these metrics should (not) be used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study pure exploration problems where the set of correct answers is possibly infinite, e.g., the regression of any continuous function of the means of the bandit. We derive an instance-dependent lower bound for these problems. By analyzing it, we discuss why existing methods (i.e., Sticky Track-and-Stop) for finite answer problems fail at being asymptotically optimal in this more general setting. Finally, we present a framework, Sticky-Sequence Track-and-Stop, which generalizes both Track-and-Stop and Sticky Track-and-Stop, and that enjoys asymptotic optimality. Due to its generality, our analysis also highlights special cases where existing methods enjoy optimality.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Multivariate Urban Data via Decomposition and Spatio-Temporal Graph Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forecasting of multivariate urban data presents a complex challenge due to the intricate dependencies between various urban metrics such as weather, air pollution, carbon intensity, and energy demand. This paper introduces a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that utilizes advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture spatial dependencies among different time-series variables. The proposed model incorporates a decomposition-based preprocessing step, isolating trend, seasonal, and residual components to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of forecasts. By leveraging the dynamic capabilities of GNNs, the model effectively captures interdependencies and improves the forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including electricity usage, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and air pollution data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across various forecasting scenarios. The results highlight the potential of the model to optimize smart infrastructure systems, contributing to energy-efficient urban development and enhanced public well-being.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of (Sticky) Track-and-Stop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pure exploration problems, a statistician sequentially collects information to answer a question about some stochastic and unknown environment. The probability of returning a wrong answer should not exceed a maximum risk parameter $\delta$ and good algorithms make as few queries to the environment as possible. The Track-and-Stop algorithm is a pioneering method to solve these problems. Specifically, it is well-known that it enjoys asymptotic optimality sample complexity guarantees for $\delta\to 0$ whenever the map from the environment to its correct answers is single-valued (e.g., best-arm identification with a unique optimal arm). The Sticky Track-and-Stop algorithm extends these results to settings where, for each environment, there might exist multiple correct answers (e.g., $\epsilon$-optimal arm identification). Although both methods are optimal in the asymptotic regime, their non-asymptotic guarantees remain unknown. In this work, we fill this gap and provide non-asymptotic guarantees for both algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at Multimodal Representation Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to develop a fundamental understanding of modality collapse, a recently observed empirical phenomenon wherein models trained for multimodal fusion tend to rely only on a subset of the modalities, ignoring the rest. We show that modality collapse happens when noisy features from one modality are entangled, via a shared set of neurons in the fusion head, with predictive features from another, effectively masking out positive contributions from the predictive features of the former modality and leading to its collapse. We further prove that cross-modal knowledge distillation implicitly disentangles such representations by freeing up rank bottlenecks in the student encoder, denoising the fusion-head outputs without negatively impacting the predictive features from either modality. Based on the above findings, we propose an algorithm that prevents modality collapse through explicit basis reallocation, with applications in dealing with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks validate our theoretical claims. Project page: https://abhrac.github.io/mmcollapse/.</description>

      <title>Understanding Adversarial Training with Energy-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim at using Energy-based Model (EBM) framework to better understand adversarial training (AT) in classifiers, and additionally to analyze the intrinsic generative capabilities of robust classifiers. By viewing standard classifiers through an energy lens, we begin by analyzing how the energies of adversarial examples, generated by various attacks, differ from those of the natural samples. The central focus of our work is to understand the critical phenomena of Catastrophic Overfitting (CO) and Robust Overfitting (RO) in AT from an energy perspective. We analyze the impact of existing AT approaches on the energy of samples during training and observe that the behavior of the ``delta energy' -- change in energy between original sample and its adversarial counterpart -- diverges significantly when CO or RO occurs. After a thorough analysis of these energy dynamics and their relationship with overfitting, we propose a novel regularizer, the Delta Energy Regularizer (DER), designed to smoothen the energy landscape during training. We demonstrate that DER is effective in mitigating both CO and RO across multiple benchmarks. We further show that robust classifiers, when being used as generative models, have limits in handling trade-off between image quality and variability. We propose an improved technique based on a local class-wise principal component analysis (PCA) and energy-based guidance for better class-specific initialization and adaptive stopping, enhancing sample diversity and generation quality. Considering that we do not explicitly train for generative modeling, we achieve a competitive Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) compared to hybrid discriminative-generative models.</description>

      <title>On the Surprising Effectiveness of Large Learning Rates under Standard Width Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large-scale vision and language models is He initialization and a single global learning rate (\textit{standard parameterization}, SP). Despite its practical success, standard parametrization remains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective: Existing infinite-width theory would predict instability under large learning rates and vanishing feature learning under stable learning rates. However, empirically optimal learning rates consistently decay much slower than theoretically predicted. By carefully studying neural network training dynamics, we demonstrate that this discrepancy is not fully explained by finite-width phenomena such as catapult effects or a lack of alignment between weights and incoming activations. We instead show that the apparent contradiction can be fundamentally resolved by taking the loss function into account: In contrast to Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, we prove that under cross-entropy (CE) loss, an intermediate \textit{controlled divergence} regime emerges, where logits diverge but loss, gradients, and activations remain stable. Stable training under large learning rates enables persistent feature evolution at scale in all hidden layers, which is crucial for the practical success of SP. In experiments across optimizers (SGD, Adam), architectures (MLPs, GPT) and data modalities (vision, language), we validate that neural networks operate in this controlled divergence regime under CE loss but not under MSE loss. Our empirical evidence suggests that width-scaling considerations are surprisingly useful for predicting empirically optimal learning rate exponents. Finally, our analysis clarifies the effectiveness and limitations of recently proposed layerwise learning rate scalings for standard initialization.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the Paradox of Importance Sampling with an Estimated History-Dependent Behavior Policy in Off-Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning with a focus on behavior policy estimation for importance sampling. Prior work has shown empirically that estimating a history-dependent behavior policy can lead to lower mean squared error (MSE) even when the true behavior policy is Markovian. However, the question of why the use of history should lower MSE remains open. In this paper, we theoretically demystify this paradox by deriving a bias-variance decomposition of the MSE of ordinary importance sampling (IS) estimators, demonstrating that history-dependent behavior policy estimation decreases their asymptotic variances while increasing their finite-sample biases. Additionally, as the estimated behavior policy conditions on a longer history, we show a consistent decrease in variance. We extend these findings to a range of other OPE estimators, including the sequential IS estimator, the doubly robust estimator and the marginalized IS estimator, with the behavior policy estimated either parametrically or non-parametrically.</description>

      <title>ProSpero: Active Learning for Robust Protein Design Beyond Wild-Type Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing protein sequences of both high fitness and novelty is a challenging task in data-efficient protein engineering. Exploration beyond wild-type neighborhoods often leads to biologically implausible sequences or relies on surrogate models that lose fidelity in novel regions. Here, we propose ProSpero, an active learning framework in which a frozen pre-trained generative model is guided by a surrogate updated from oracle feedback. By integrating fitness-relevant residue selection with biologically-constrained Sequential Monte Carlo sampling, our approach enables exploration beyond wild-type neighborhoods while preserving biological plausibility. We show that our framework remains effective even when the surrogate is misspecified. ProSpero consistently outperforms or matches existing methods across diverse protein engineering tasks, retrieving sequences of both high fitness and novelty.</description>

      <title>Geometric GNNs for Charged Particle Tracking at GlueX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear physics experiments are aimed at uncovering the fundamental building blocks of matter. The experiments involve high-energy collisions that produce complex events with many particle trajectories. Tracking charged particles resulting from collisions in the presence of a strong magnetic field is critical to enable the reconstruction of particle trajectories and precise determination of interactions. It is traditionally achieved through combinatorial approaches that scale worse than linearly as the number of hits grows. Since particle hit data naturally form a 3-dimensional point cloud and can be structured as graphs, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) emerge as an intuitive and effective choice for this task. In this study, we evaluate the GNN model for track finding on the data from the GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab. We use simulation data to train the model and test on both simulation and real GlueX measurements. We demonstrate that GNN-based track finding outperforms the currently used traditional method at GlueX in terms of segment-based efficiency at a fixed purity while providing faster inferences. We show that the GNN model can achieve significant speedup by processing multiple events in batches, which exploits the parallel computation capability of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Finally, we compare the GNN implementation on GPU and FPGA and describe the trade-off.</description>

      <title>Sparsification and Reconstruction from the Perspective of Representation Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a predominant tool in mechanistic interpretability, aiming to identify interpretable monosemantic features. However, how does sparse encoding organize the representations of activation vector from language models? What is the relationship between this organizational paradigm and feature disentanglement as well as reconstruction performance? To address these questions, we propose the SAEMA, which validates the stratified structure of the representation by observing the variability of the rank of the symmetric semipositive definite (SSPD) matrix corresponding to the modal tensor unfolded along the latent tensor with the level of noise added to the residual stream. To systematically investigate how sparse encoding alters representational structures, we define local and global representations, demonstrating that they amplify inter-feature distinctions by merging similar semantic features and introducing additional dimensionality. Furthermore, we intervene the global representation from an optimization perspective, proving a significant causal relationship between their separability and the reconstruction performance. This study explains the principles of sparsity from the perspective of representational geometry and demonstrates the impact of changes in representational structure on reconstruction performance. Particularly emphasizes the necessity of understanding representations and incorporating representational constraints, providing empirical references for developing new interpretable tools and improving SAEs.

      <title>Accelerating Optimization via Differentiable Stopping Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization is an important module of modern machine learning applications. Tremendous efforts have been made to accelerate optimization algorithms. A common formulation is achieving a lower loss at a given time. This enables a differentiable framework with respect to the algorithm hyperparameters. In contrast, its dual, minimizing the time to reach a target loss, is believed to be non-differentiable, as the time is not differentiable. As a result, it usually serves as a conceptual framework or is optimized using zeroth-order methods. To address this limitation, we propose a differentiable stopping time and theoretically justify it based on differential equations. An efficient algorithm is designed to backpropagate through it. As a result, the proposed differentiable stopping time enables a new differentiable formulation for accelerating algorithms. We further discuss its applications, such as online hyperparameter tuning and learning to optimize. Our proposed methods show superior performance in comprehensive experiments across various problems, which confirms their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Supervised Learning Models for Fraud Detection: A Comparative Study of Classical and Deep Architectures on Imbalanced Transaction Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fraud detection remains a critical task in high-stakes domains such as finance and e-commerce, where undetected fraudulent transactions can lead to significant economic losses. In this study, we systematically compare the performance of four supervised learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network - on a large-scale, highly imbalanced online transaction dataset. While ensemble methods such as Random Forest and LightGBM demonstrated superior performance in both overall and class-specific metrics, Logistic Regression offered a reliable and interpretable baseline. The GRU model showed strong recall for the minority fraud class, though at the cost of precision, highlighting a trade-off relevant for real-world deployment. Our evaluation emphasizes not only weighted averages but also per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores, providing a nuanced view of each model's effectiveness in detecting rare but consequential fraudulent activity. The findings underscore the importance of choosing models based on the specific risk tolerance and operational needs of fraud detection systems.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Alignment of Discrete Diffusion Models with Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have become highly effective across various domains. However, real-world applications often require the generative process to adhere to certain constraints but without task-specific fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a training-free method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution at the test time. Our approach leverages twisted SMC with an approximate locally optimal proposal, obtained via a first-order Taylor expansion of the reward function. To address the challenge of ill-defined gradients in discrete spaces, we incorporate a Gumbel-Softmax relaxation, enabling efficient gradient-based approximation within the discrete generative framework. Empirical results on both synthetic datasets and image modelling validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Training RL Agents for Multi-Objective Network Defense Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-ended learning (OEL) -- which emphasizes training agents that achieve broad capability over narrow competency -- is emerging as a paradigm to develop artificial intelligence (AI) agents to achieve robustness and generalization. However, despite promising results that demonstrate the benefits of OEL, applying OEL to develop autonomous agents for real-world cybersecurity applications remains a challenge.
  We propose a training approach, inspired by OEL, to develop autonomous network defenders. Our results demonstrate that like in other domains, OEL principles can translate into more robust and generalizable agents for cyber defense. To apply OEL to network defense, it is necessary to address several technical challenges. Most importantly, it is critical to provide a task representation approach over a broad universe of tasks that maintains a consistent interface over goals, rewards and action spaces. This way, the learning agent can train with varying network conditions, attacker behaviors, and defender goals while being able to build on previously gained knowledge.
  With our tools and results, we aim to fundamentally impact research that applies AI to solve cybersecurity problems. Specifically, as researchers develop gyms and benchmarks for cyber defense, it is paramount that they consider diverse tasks with consistent representations, such as those we propose in our work.</description>

      <title>TabularQGAN: A Quantum Generative Model for Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum generative model for synthesizing tabular data. Synthetic data is valuable in scenarios where real-world data is scarce or private, it can be used to augment or replace existing datasets. Real-world enterprise data is predominantly tabular and heterogeneous, often comprising a mixture of categorical and numerical features, making it highly relevant across various industries such as healthcare, finance, and software. We propose a quantum generative adversarial network architecture with flexible data encoding and a novel quantum circuit ansatz to effectively model tabular data. The proposed approach is tested on the MIMIC III healthcare and Adult Census datasets, with extensive benchmarking against leading classical models, CTGAN, and CopulaGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that our quantum model outperforms classical models by an average of 8.5% with respect to an overall similarity score from SDMetrics, while using only 0.072% of the parameters of the classical models. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of the models using two custom-designed metrics that demonstrate the ability of the proposed quantum model to generate useful and novel samples. To our knowledge, this is one of the first demonstrations of a successful quantum generative model for handling tabular data, indicating that this task could be well-suited to quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification with Proper Scoring Rules: Adjusting Measures to Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty quantification and propose measures of total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on a known decomposition of (strictly) proper scoring rules, a specific type of loss function, into a divergence and an entropy component. This leads to a flexible framework for uncertainty quantification that can be instantiated with different losses (scoring rules), which makes it possible to tailor uncertainty quantification to the use case at hand. We show that this flexibility is indeed advantageous. In particular, we analyze the task of selective prediction and show that the scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. In addition, we perform experiments on two other common tasks. For out-of-distribution detection, our results confirm that a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, mutual information, performs best. Moreover, in the setting of active learning, our measure of epistemic uncertainty based on the zero-one-loss consistently outperforms other uncertainty measures.</description>

      <title>A Human-Centric Approach to Explainable AI for Personalized Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks form the backbone of artificial intelligence research, with potential to transform the human experience in areas ranging from autonomous driving to personal assistants, healthcare to education. However, their integration into the daily routines of real-world classrooms remains limited. It is not yet common for a teacher to assign students individualized homework targeting their specific weaknesses, provide students with instant feedback, or simulate student responses to a new exam question. While these models excel in predictive performance, this lack of adoption can be attributed to a significant weakness: the lack of explainability of model decisions, leading to a lack of trust from students, parents, and teachers. This thesis aims to bring human needs to the forefront of eXplainable AI (XAI) research, grounded in the concrete use case of personalized learning and teaching. We frame the contributions along two verticals: technical advances in XAI and their aligned human studies. We investigate explainability in AI for education, revealing systematic disagreements between post-hoc explainers and identifying a need for inherently interpretable model architectures. We propose four novel technical contributions in interpretability with a multimodal modular architecture (MultiModN), an interpretable mixture-of-experts model (InterpretCC), adversarial training for explainer stability, and a theory-driven LLM-XAI framework to present explanations to students (iLLuMinaTE), which we evaluate in diverse settings with professors, teachers, learning scientists, and university students. By combining empirical evaluations of existing explainers with novel architectural designs and human studies, our work lays a foundation for human-centric AI systems that balance state-of-the-art performance with built-in transparency and trust.</description>

      <title>DES-LOC: Desynced Low Communication Adaptive Optimizers for Training Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling foundation model training with Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) methods is bandwidth-limited. Existing infrequent communication methods like Local SGD were designed to synchronize only model parameters and cannot be trivially applied to adaptive optimizers due to additional optimizer states. Current approaches extending Local SGD either lack convergence guarantees or require synchronizing all optimizer states, tripling communication costs. We propose Desynced Low Communication Adaptive Optimizers (DES-LOC), a family of optimizers assigning independent synchronization periods to parameters and momenta, enabling lower communication costs while preserving convergence. Through extensive experiments on language models of up to 1.7B, we show that DES-LOC can communicate 170x less than DDP and 2x less than the previous state-of-the-art Local ADAM. Furthermore, unlike previous heuristic approaches, DES-LOC is suited for practical training scenarios prone to system failures. DES-LOC offers a scalable, bandwidth-efficient, and fault-tolerant solution for foundation model training.</description>

      <title>Geometric Hyena Networks for Large-scale Equivariant Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processing global geometric context while preserving equivariance is crucial when modeling biological, chemical, and physical systems. Yet, this is challenging due to the computational demands of equivariance and global context at scale. Standard methods such as equivariant self-attention suffer from quadratic complexity, while local methods such as distance-based message passing sacrifice global information. Inspired by the recent success of state-space and long-convolutional models, we introduce Geometric Hyena, the first equivariant long-convolutional model for geometric systems. Geometric Hyena captures global geometric context at sub-quadratic complexity while maintaining equivariance to rotations and translations. Evaluated on all-atom property prediction of large RNA molecules and full protein molecular dynamics, Geometric Hyena outperforms existing equivariant models while requiring significantly less memory and compute that equivariant self-attention. Notably, our model processes the geometric context of 30k tokens 20x faster than the equivariant transformer and allows 72x longer context within the same budget.</description>

      <title>FNOPE: Simulation-based inference on function spaces with Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is an established approach for performing Bayesian inference on scientific simulators. SBI so far works best on low-dimensional parametric models. However, it is difficult to infer function-valued parameters, which frequently occur in disciplines that model spatiotemporal processes such as the climate and earth sciences. Here, we introduce an approach for efficient posterior estimation, using a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) architecture with a flow matching objective. We show that our approach, FNOPE, can perform inference of function-valued parameters at a fraction of the simulation budget of state of the art methods. In addition, FNOPE supports posterior evaluation at arbitrary discretizations of the domain, as well as simultaneous estimation of vector-valued parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark tasks and a challenging spatial inference task from glaciology. FNOPE extends the applicability of SBI methods to new scientific domains by enabling the inference of function-valued parameters.</description>

      <title>Benignity of loss landscape with weight decay requires both large overparametrization and initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of neural networks under weight decay remains poorly understood from a theoretical standpoint. While weight decay is standard practice in modern training procedures, most theoretical analyses focus on unregularized settings. In this work, we investigate the loss landscape of the $\ell_2$-regularized training loss for two-layer ReLU networks. We show that the landscape becomes benign -- i.e., free of spurious local minima -- under large overparametrization, specifically when the network width $m$ satisfies $m \gtrsim \min(n^d, 2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of data points and $d$ the input dimension. More precisely in this regime, almost all constant activation regions contain a global minimum and no spurious local minima. We further show that this level of overparametrization is not only sufficient but also necessary via the example of orthogonal data. Finally, we demonstrate that such loss landscape results primarily hold relevance in the large initialization regime. In contrast, for small initializations -- corresponding to the feature learning regime -- optimization can still converge to spurious local minima, despite the global benignity of the landscape.</description>

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the influence of specific training samples, ideally recovering the model that would have resulted from training on the remaining data alone. We study unlearning in the overparameterized setting, where many models interpolate the data, and defining the unlearning solution as any loss minimizer over the retained set$\unicode{x2013}$as in prior work in the underparameterized setting$\unicode{x2013}$is inadequate, since the original model may already interpolate the retained data and satisfy this condition. In this regime, loss gradients vanish, rendering prior methods based on gradient perturbations ineffective, motivating both new unlearning definitions and algorithms. For this setting, we define the unlearning solution as the minimum-complexity interpolator over the retained data and propose a new algorithmic framework that only requires access to model gradients on the retained set at the original solution. We minimize a regularized objective over perturbations constrained to be orthogonal to these model gradients, a first-order relaxation of the interpolation condition. For different model classes, we provide exact and approximate unlearning guarantees, and we demonstrate that an implementation of our framework outperforms existing baselines across various unlearning experiments.</description>

      <title>One Rank at a Time: Cascading Error Dynamics in Sequential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential learning -- where complex tasks are broken down into simpler, hierarchical components -- has emerged as a paradigm in AI. This paper views sequential learning through the lens of low-rank linear regression, focusing specifically on how errors propagate when learning rank-1 subspaces sequentially. We present an analysis framework that decomposes the learning process into a series of rank-1 estimation problems, where each subsequent estimation depends on the accuracy of previous steps. Our contribution is a characterization of the error propagation in this sequential process, establishing bounds on how errors -- e.g., due to limited computational budgets and finite precision -- affect the overall model accuracy. We prove that these errors compound in predictable ways, with implications for both algorithmic design and stability guarantees.</description>

      <title>The Entropy Mechanism of Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with LLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently observed across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy entropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished exploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy performance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b between entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly indicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus bottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0, R=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration toward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics both theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change in policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and the change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy Gradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance term and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical conclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout training, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically. Through understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to control entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens. Specifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov and KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances respectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus helping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream performance.</description>

      <title>Understanding (Un)Reliability of Steering Vectors in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method to control language model behavior by adding a learned bias to the activations at inference time. Although steering demonstrates promising performance, recent work shows that it can be unreliable or even counterproductive in some cases. This paper studies the influence of prompt types and the geometry of activation differences on steering reliability. First, we find that all seven prompt types used in our experiments produce a net positive steering effect, but exhibit high variance across samples, and often give an effect opposite of the desired one. No prompt type clearly outperforms the others, and yet the steering vectors resulting from the different prompt types often differ directionally (as measured by cosine similarity). Second, we show that higher cosine similarity between training set activation differences predicts more effective steering. Finally, we observe that datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated are more steerable. Our results suggest that vector steering is unreliable when the target behavior is not represented by a coherent direction.</description>

      <title>Spectral Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival analysis is widely deployed in a diverse set of fields, including healthcare, business, ecology, etc. The Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model is a semi-parametric model often encountered in the literature. Despite its popularity, wide deployment, and numerous variants, scaling CoxPH to large datasets and deep architectures poses a challenge, especially in the high-dimensional regime. We identify a fundamental connection between rank regression and the CoxPH model: this allows us to adapt and extend the so-called spectral method for rank regression to survival analysis. Our approach is versatile, naturally generalizing to several CoxPH variants, including deep models. We empirically verify our method's scalability on multiple real-world high-dimensional datasets; our method outperforms legacy methods w.r.t. predictive performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>On Learning Verifiers for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving complex mathematical and logical problems. However, it can often veer off track through incorrect or unsubstantiated inferences. Formal mathematical reasoning, which can be checked with a formal verifier, is one approach to addressing this issue. However, currently LLMs are simply not good enough to solve complex problems in a formal way, and even just formalizing an informal problem statement can be challenging. Motivated by this fact, in this work we consider the problem of learning reliable verifiers for natural language Chain-of-Thought reasoning. That is, given a problem statement and step-by-step solution in natural language, the aim of the verifier is to output [Yes] if the reasoning steps in the solution are all valid, and [No] otherwise. In this work we give a formal PAC-learning framework for studying this problem. We propose and analyze several natural verification goals, at different levels of strength, in this framework. We provide sample complexity upper-bounds for learning verifiers satisfying these goals, as well as lower-bound and impossibility results for learning other natural verification objectives without additional assumptions.</description>

      <title>Position: Uncertainty Quantification Needs Reassessment for Large-language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user, and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning, to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Confidence Alone Improves Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems. However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen and Mistral families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method lends itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external supervision is limited or unavailable.</description>

      <title>Offset Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11045v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire knowledge from their training corpora, the memorization of sensitive information in the corpora such as copyrighted, biased, and private content has led to ethical and legal concerns. In response to these challenges, unlearning has emerged as a potential remedy for LLMs affected by problematic training data. However, previous unlearning techniques are either not applicable to black-box LLMs due to required access to model internal weights, or violate data protection principles by retaining sensitive data for inference-time correction. We propose {\delta}-Unlearning, an offset unlearning framework for black-box LLMs. Instead of tuning the black-box LLM itself, {\delta}-Unlearning learns the logit offset needed for unlearning by contrasting the logits from a pair of smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that {\delta}- Unlearning can effectively unlearn target data while maintaining similar or even stronger performance on general out-of-forget-scope tasks. {\delta}-Unlearning also effectively incorporates different unlearning algorithms, making our approach a versatile solution to adapting various existing unlearning algorithms to black-box LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum computing have spurred significant interest in harnessing its potential for speedups over classical systems. However, noise remains a major obstacle to achieving reliable quantum algorithms. In this work, we present a provably noise-resilient training theory and algorithm to enhance the robustness of parameterized quantum circuit classifiers. Our method, with a natural connection to Evolutionary Strategies, guarantees resilience to parameter noise with minimal adjustments to commonly used optimization algorithms. Our approach is function-agnostic and adaptable to various quantum circuits, successfully demonstrated in quantum phase classification tasks. By developing provably guaranteed optimization theory with quantum circuits, our work opens new avenues for practical, robust applications of near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Capability-Based Scaling Laws for LLM Red-Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However, traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and (iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models, increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.</description>

      <title>Genetic Influences on Brain Aging: Analyzing Sex Differences in the UK Biobank using Structural MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain aging trajectories differ between males and females, yet the genetic factors underlying these differences remain underexplored. Using structural MRI and genotyping data from 40,940 UK Biobank participants (aged 45-83), we computed Brain Age Gap Estimates (BrainAGE) for total brain, hippocampal, and ventricular volumes. We conducted sex-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and Post-GWAS analyses to identify genetic variants associated with accelerated brain aging. Distinct gene sets emerged by sex: in females, neurotransmitter transport and mitochondrial stress response genes were implicated; in males, immune and inflammation-related genes dominated. Shared genes, including GMNC and OSTN, were consistently linked to brain volumes across sexes, suggesting core roles in neurostructural maintenance. Tissue expression analyses revealed sex-specific enrichment in pathways tied to neurodegeneration. These findings highlight the importance of sex-stratified approaches in aging research and suggest genetic targets for personalized interventions against age-related cognitive decline.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection of abnormal clinical EEG: comparison of a finetuned foundation model with two deep learning models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used by physicians for the diagnosis of numerous neurological disorders. Due to the large volume of EEGs requiring interpretation and the specific expertise involved, artificial intelligence-based tools are being developed to assist in their visual analysis. In this paper, we compare two deep learning models (CNN-LSTM and Transformer-based) with BioSerenity-E1, a recently proposed foundation model, in the task of classifying entire EEG recordings as normal or abnormal. The three models were trained or finetuned on 2,500 EEG recordings and their performances were evaluated on two private and one public datasets: a large multicenter dataset annotated by a single specialist (dataset A composed of n = 4,480 recordings), a small multicenter dataset annotated by three specialists (dataset B, n = 198), and the Temple University Abnormal (TUAB) EEG corpus evaluation dataset (n = 276). On dataset A, the three models achieved at least 86% balanced accuracy, with BioSerenity-E1 finetuned achieving the highest balanced accuracy (89.19% [88.36-90.41]). BioSerenity-E1 finetuned also achieved the best performance on dataset B, with 94.63% [92.32-98.12] balanced accuracy. The models were then validated on TUAB evaluation dataset, whose corresponding training set was not used during training, where they achieved at least 76% accuracy. Specifically, BioSerenity-E1 finetuned outperformed the other two models, reaching an accuracy of 82.25% [78.27-87.48]. Our results highlight the usefulness of leveraging pre-trained models for automatic EEG classification: enabling robust and efficient interpretation of EEG data with fewer resources and broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vision Transformer Explainability Using Artificial Astrocytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models achieve high precision, but their decision-making processes often lack explainability. Furthermore, as model complexity increases, explainability typically decreases. Existing efforts to improve explainability primarily involve developing new eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques or incorporating explainability constraints during training. While these approaches yield specific improvements, their applicability remains limited. In this work, we propose the Vision Transformer with artificial Astrocytes (ViTA). This training-free approach is inspired by neuroscience and enhances the reasoning of a pretrained deep neural network to generate more human-aligned explanations. We evaluated our approach employing two well-known XAI techniques, Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, and compared it to a standard Vision Transformer (ViT). Using the ClickMe dataset, we quantified the similarity between the heatmaps produced by the XAI techniques and a (human-aligned) ground truth. Our results consistently demonstrate that incorporating artificial astrocytes enhances the alignment of model explanations with human perception, leading to statistically significant improvements across all XAI techniques and metrics utilized.</description>

      <title>CIM-NET: A Video Denoising Deep Neural Network Model Optimized for Computing-in-Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep neural network (DNN)-based video denoising has demonstrated significant performance, deploying state-of-the-art models on edge devices remains challenging due to stringent real-time and energy efficiency requirements. Computing-in-Memory (CIM) chips offer a promising solution by integrating computation within memory cells, enabling rapid matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). However, existing DNN models are often designed without considering CIM architectural constraints, thus limiting their acceleration potential during inference. To address this, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-design framework incorporating two innovations: (1) a CIM-Aware Architecture, CIM-NET, optimized for large receptive field operation and CIM's crossbar-based MVM acceleration; and (2) a pseudo-convolutional operator, CIM-CONV, used within CIM-NET to integrate slide-based processing with fully connected transformations for high-quality feature extraction and reconstruction. This framework significantly reduces the number of MVM operations, improving inference speed on CIM chips while maintaining competitive performance. Experimental results indicate that, compared to the conventional lightweight model FastDVDnet, CIM-NET substantially reduces MVM operations with a slight decrease in denoising performance. With a stride value of 8, CIM-NET reduces MVM operations to 1/77th of the original, while maintaining competitive PSNR (35.11 dB vs. 35.56 dB</description>

      <title>Learning Shared Representations from Unpaired Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks, generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific modalities of the data.

      <title>UniDB++: Fast Sampling of Unified Diffusion Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Bridges enable transitions between arbitrary distributions, with the Unified Diffusion Bridge (UniDB) framework achieving high-fidelity image generation via a Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) formulation. However, UniDB's reliance on iterative Euler sampling methods results in slow, computationally expensive inference, while existing acceleration techniques for diffusion or diffusion bridge models fail to address its unique challenges: missing terminal mean constraints and SOC-specific penalty coefficients in its SDEs. We present UniDB++, a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly improves upon these limitations. The method's key advancement comes from deriving exact closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDEs, effectively reducing the error accumulation inherent in Euler approximations and enabling high-quality generation with up to 20$\times$ fewer sampling steps. This method is further complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains perceptual quality for low-step regimes (5-10 steps). Additionally, we demonstrate that UniDB++ aligns with existing diffusion bridge acceleration methods by evaluating their update rules, and UniDB++ can recover DBIMs as special cases under some theoretical conditions. Experiments demonstrate UniDB++'s state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks, outperforming Euler-based methods in fidelity and speed while reducing inference time significantly. This work bridges the gap between theoretical generality and practical efficiency in SOC-driven diffusion bridge models. Our code is available at https://github.com/2769433owo/UniDB-plusplus.</description>

      <title>EvidenceMoE: A Physics-Guided Mixture-of-Experts with Evidential Critics for Advancing Fluorescence Light Detection and Ranging in Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence LiDAR (FLiDAR), a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology employed for distance and depth estimation across medical, automotive, and other fields, encounters significant computational challenges in scattering media. The complex nature of the acquired FLiDAR signal, particularly in such environments, makes isolating photon time-of-flight (related to target depth) and intrinsic fluorescence lifetime exceptionally difficult, thus limiting the effectiveness of current analytical and computational methodologies. To overcome this limitation, we present a Physics-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework tailored for specialized modeling of diverse temporal components. In contrast to the conventional MoE approaches our expert models are informed by underlying physics, such as the radiative transport equation governing photon propagation in scattering media. Central to our approach is EvidenceMoE, which integrates Evidence-Based Dirichlet Critics (EDCs). These critic models assess the reliability of each expert's output by providing per-expert quality scores and corrective feedback. A Decider Network then leverages this information to fuse expert predictions into a robust final estimate adaptively. We validate our method using realistically simulated Fluorescence LiDAR (FLiDAR) data for non-invasive cancer cell depth detection generated from photon transport models in tissue. Our framework demonstrates strong performance, achieving a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 0.030 for depth estimation and 0.074 for fluorescence lifetime.</description>

      <title>Self-Organizing Visual Prototypes for Non-Parametric Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Self-Organizing Visual Prototypes (SOP), a new training technique for unsupervised visual feature learning. Unlike existing prototypical self-supervised learning (SSL) methods that rely on a single prototype to encode all relevant features of a hidden cluster in the data, we propose the SOP strategy. In this strategy, a prototype is represented by many semantically similar representations, or support embeddings (SEs), each containing a complementary set of features that together better characterize their region in space and maximize training performance. We reaffirm the feasibility of non-parametric SSL by introducing novel non-parametric adaptations of two loss functions that implement the SOP strategy. Notably, we introduce the SOP Masked Image Modeling (SOP-MIM) task, where masked representations are reconstructed from the perspective of multiple non-parametric local SEs. We comprehensively evaluate the representations learned using the SOP strategy on a range of benchmarks, including retrieval, linear evaluation, fine-tuning, and object detection. Our pre-trained encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance on many retrieval benchmarks and demonstrate increasing performance gains with more complex encoders.</description>

      <title>Is Attention Required for Transformer Inference? Explore Function-preserving Attention Replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While transformers excel across vision and language pretraining tasks, their reliance on attention mechanisms poses challenges for inference efficiency, especially on edge and embedded accelerators with limited parallelism and memory bandwidth. Hinted by the observed redundancy of attention at inference time, we hypothesize that though the model learns complicated token dependency through pretraining, the inference-time sequence-to-sequence mapping in each attention layer is actually ''simple'' enough to be represented with a much cheaper function. In this work, we explore FAR, a Function-preserving Attention Replacement framework that replaces all attention blocks in pretrained transformers with learnable sequence-to-sequence modules, exemplified by an LSTM. FAR optimize a multi-head LSTM architecture with a block-wise distillation objective and a global structural pruning framework to achieve a family of efficient LSTM-based models from pretrained transformers. We validate FAR on the DeiT vision transformer family and demonstrate that it matches the accuracy of the original models on ImageNet and multiple downstream tasks with reduced parameters and latency. Further analysis shows that FAR preserves the semantic token relationships and the token-to-token correlation learned in the transformer's attention module.</description>

      <title>CiRL: Open-Source Environments for Reinforcement Learning in Circular Economy and Net Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand of finite raw materials will keep increasing as they fuel modern society. Simultaneously, solutions for stopping carbon emissions in the short term are not available, thus making the net zero target extremely challenging to achieve at scale. The circular economy (CE) paradigm is gaining attention as a solution to address climate change and the uncertainties of supplies of critical materials. Hence, in this paper, we introduce CiRL, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) library of environments focused on the circularity of both solid and fluid materials. The integration of DRL into the design of material circularity is possible thanks to the formalism of thermodynamical material networks, which is underpinned by compartmental dynamical thermodynamics. Along with the focus on circularity, this library has three more features: the new CE-oriented environments are in the state-space form, which is typically used in dynamical systems analysis and control designs; it is based on a state-of-the-art Python library of DRL algorithms, namely, Stable-Baselines3; and it is developed in Google Colaboratory to be accessible to researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds as is often the case for circular economy researchers and engineers. CiRL is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Corruption-Aware Training of Latent Video Diffusion Models for Robust Text-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) achieve high-quality generation but are sensitive to imperfect conditioning, which causes semantic drift and temporal incoherence on noisy, web-scale video-text datasets. We introduce CAT-LVDM, the first corruption-aware training framework for LVDMs that improves robustness through structured, data-aligned noise injection. Our method includes Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI), which perturbs embeddings along intra-batch semantic directions to preserve temporal consistency. BCNI is especially effective on caption-rich datasets like WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD. We also propose Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN), which injects noise along dominant spectral directions to improve low-frequency smoothness, showing strong results on UCF-101. On average, BCNI reduces FVD by 31.9% across WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD, while SACN yields a 12.3% improvement on UCF-101. Ablation studies confirm the benefit of low-rank, data-aligned noise. Our theoretical analysis further explains how such perturbations tighten entropy, Wasserstein, score-drift, mixing-time, and generalization bounds. CAT-LVDM establishes a principled, scalable training approach for robust video diffusion under multimodal noise. Code and models: https://github.com/chikap421/catlvdm</description>

      <title>WhisperD: Dementia Speech Recognition and Filler Word Detection with Whisper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whisper fails to correctly transcribe dementia speech because persons with dementia (PwDs) often exhibit irregular speech patterns and disfluencies such as pauses, repetitions, and fragmented sentences. It was trained on standard speech and may have had little or no exposure to dementia-affected speech. However, correct transcription is vital for dementia speech for cost-effective diagnosis and the development of assistive technology. In this work, we fine-tune Whisper with the open-source dementia speech dataset (DementiaBank) and our in-house dataset to improve its word error rate (WER). The fine-tuning also includes filler words to ascertain the filler inclusion rate (FIR) and F1 score. The fine-tuned models significantly outperformed the off-the-shelf models. The medium-sized model achieved a WER of 0.24, outperforming previous work. Similarly, there was a notable generalisability to unseen data and speech patterns.</description>

      <title>Understanding the learned look-ahead behavior of chess neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the look-ahead capabilities of chess-playing neural networks, specifically focusing on the Leela Chess Zero policy network. We build on the work of Jenner et al. (2024) by analyzing the model's ability to consider future moves and alternative sequences beyond the immediate next move. Our findings reveal that the network's look-ahead behavior is highly context-dependent, varying significantly based on the specific chess position. We demonstrate that the model can process information about board states up to seven moves ahead, utilizing similar internal mechanisms across different future time steps. Additionally, we provide evidence that the network considers multiple possible move sequences rather than focusing on a single line of play. These results offer new insights into the emergence of sophisticated look-ahead capabilities in neural networks trained on strategic tasks, contributing to our understanding of AI reasoning in complex domains. Our work also showcases the effectiveness of interpretability techniques in uncovering cognitive-like processes in artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network traffic prediction techniques have attracted much attention since they are valuable for network congestion control and user experience improvement. While existing prediction techniques can achieve favorable performance when there is sufficient training data, it remains a great challenge to make accurate predictions when only a small amount of training data is available. To tackle this problem, we propose a deep learning model, entitled MetaSTNet, based on a multimodal meta-learning framework. It is an end-to-end network architecture that trains the model in a simulator and transfers the meta-knowledge to a real-world environment, which can quickly adapt and obtain accurate predictions on a new task with only a small amount of real-world training data. In addition, we further employ cross conformal prediction to assess the calibrated prediction intervals. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of MetaSTNet.</description>

      <title>A Novel Convolutional Neural Network-Based Framework for Complex Multiclass Brassica Seed Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agricultural research has accelerated in recent years, yet farmers often lack the time and resources for on-farm research due to the demands of crop production and farm operations. Seed classification offers valuable insights into quality control, production efficiency, and impurity detection. Early identification of seed types is critical to reducing the cost and risk associated with field emergence, which can lead to yield losses or disruptions in downstream processes like harvesting. Seed sampling supports growers in monitoring and managing seed quality, improving precision in determining seed purity levels, guiding management adjustments, and enhancing yield estimations. This study proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework for the efficient classification of ten common Brassica seed types. The approach addresses the inherent challenge of texture similarity in seed images using a custom-designed CNN architecture. The model's performance was evaluated against several pre-trained state-of-the-art architectures, with adjustments to layer configurations for optimized classification. Experimental results using our collected Brassica seed dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieved a high accuracy rate of 93 percent.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation Approach for SOS Fusion Staging: Towards Fully Automated Skeletal Maturity Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework for the automated staging of spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS) fusion, a critical diagnostic marker in both orthodontics and forensic anthropology. Our approach leverages a dual-model architecture wherein a teacher model, trained on manually cropped images, transfers its precise spatial understanding to a student model that operates on full, uncropped images. This knowledge distillation is facilitated by a newly formulated loss function that aligns spatial logits as well as incorporates gradient-based attention spatial mapping, ensuring that the student model internalizes the anatomically relevant features without relying on external cropping or YOLO-based segmentation. By leveraging expert-curated data and feedback at each step, our framework attains robust diagnostic accuracy, culminating in a clinically viable end-to-end pipeline. This streamlined approach obviates the need for additional pre-processing tools and accelerates deployment, thereby enhancing both the efficiency and consistency of skeletal maturation assessment in diverse clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-instance Learning as Downstream Task of Self-Supervised Learning-based Pre-trained Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In deep multi-instance learning, the number of applicable instances depends on the data set. In histopathology images, deep learning multi-instance learners usually assume there are hundreds to thousands instances in a bag. However, when the number of instances in a bag increases to 256 in brain hematoma CT, learning becomes extremely difficult. In this paper, we address this drawback. To overcome this problem, we propose using a pre-trained model with self-supervised learning for the multi-instance learner as a downstream task. With this method, even when the original target task suffers from the spurious correlation problem, we show improvements of 5% to 13% in accuracy and 40% to 55% in the F1 measure for the hypodensity marker classification of brain hematoma CT.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model-based Activity Completion for AI Motion Capture from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-based motion capture is an emerging technology that offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional motion capture systems. However, current AI motion capture methods rely entirely on observed video sequences, similar to conventional motion capture. This means that all human actions must be predefined, and movements outside the observed sequences are not possible. To address this limitation, we aim to apply AI motion capture to virtual humans, where flexible actions beyond the observed sequences are required. We assume that while many action fragments exist in the training data, the transitions between them may be missing. To bridge these gaps, we propose a diffusion-model-based action completion technique that generates complementary human motion sequences, ensuring smooth and continuous movements. By introducing a gate module and a position-time embedding module, our approach achieves competitive results on the Human3.6M dataset. Our experimental results show that (1) MDC-Net outperforms existing methods in ADE, FDE, and MMADE but is slightly less accurate in MMFDE, (2) MDC-Net has a smaller model size (16.84M) compared to HumanMAC (28.40M), and (3) MDC-Net generates more natural and coherent motion sequences. Additionally, we propose a method for extracting sensor data, including acceleration and angular velocity, from human motion sequences.</description>

      <title>EaqVLA: Encoding-aligned Quantization for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of Embodied Artificial intelligence, the end-to-end control policy such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model has become the mainstream. Existing VLA models faces expensive computing/storage cost, which need to be optimized. Quantization is considered as the most effective method which can not only reduce the memory cost but also achieve computation acceleration. However, we find the token alignment of VLA models hinders the application of existing quantization methods. To address this, we proposed an optimized framework called EaqVLA, which apply encoding-aligned quantization to VLA models. Specifically, we propose an complete analysis method to find the misalignment in various granularity. Based on the analysis results, we propose a mixed precision quantization with the awareness of encoding alignment. Experiments shows that the porposed EaqVLA achieves better quantization performance (with the minimal quantization loss for end-to-end action control and xxx times acceleration) than existing quantization methods.</description>

      <title>Thickness-aware E(3)-Equivariant 3D Mesh Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesh-based 3D static analysis methods have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to traditional computational numerical solvers, significantly reducing computational costs and runtime for various physics-based analyses. However, these methods primarily focus on surface topology and geometry, often overlooking the inherent thickness of real-world 3D objects, which exhibits high correlations and similar behavior between opposing surfaces. This limitation arises from the disconnected nature of these surfaces and the absence of internal edge connections within the mesh. In this work, we propose a novel framework, the Thickness-aware E(3)-Equivariant 3D Mesh Neural Network (T-EMNN), that effectively integrates the thickness of 3D objects while maintaining the computational efficiency of surface meshes. Additionally, we introduce data-driven coordinates that encode spatial information while preserving E(3)-equivariance or invariance properties, ensuring consistent and robust analysis. Evaluations on a real-world industrial dataset demonstrate the superior performance of T-EMNN in accurately predicting node-level 3D deformations, effectively capturing thickness effects while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Do We Need All the Synthetic Data? Towards Targeted Synthetic Image Augmentation via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetically augmenting training datasets with diffusion models has been an effective strategy for improving generalization of image classifiers. However, existing techniques struggle to ensure the diversity of generation and increase the size of the data by up to 10-30x to improve the in-distribution performance. In this work, we show that synthetically augmenting part of the data that is not learned early in training outperforms augmenting the entire dataset. By analyzing a two-layer CNN, we prove that this strategy improves generalization by promoting homogeneity in feature learning speed without amplifying noise. Our extensive experiments show that by augmenting only 30%-40% of the data, our method boosts the performance by up to 2.8% in a variety of scenarios, including training ResNet, ViT and DenseNet on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, with a range of optimizers including SGD and SAM. Notably, our method applied with SGD outperforms the SOTA optimizer, SAM, on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet. It can also easily stack with existing weak and strong augmentation strategies to further boost the performance.</description>

      <title>A Kernelised Stein Discrepancy for Assessing the Fit of Inhomogeneous Random Graph Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex data are often represented as a graph, which in turn can often be viewed as a realisation of a random graph, such as of an inhomogeneous random graph model (IRG). For general fast goodness-of-fit tests in high dimensions, kernelised Stein discrepancy (KSD) tests are a powerful tool. Here, we develop, test, and analyse a KSD-type goodness-of-fit test for IRG models that can be carried out with a single observation of the network. The test is applicable to a network of any size and does not depend on the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic. We also provide theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Do you see what I see? An Ambiguous Optical Illusion Dataset exposing limitations of Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From uncertainty quantification to real-world object detection, we recognize the importance of machine learning algorithms, particularly in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving or medical diagnostics. In machine learning, ambiguous data plays an important role in various machine learning domains. Optical illusions present a compelling area of study in this context, as they offer insight into the limitations of both human and machine perception. Despite this relevance, optical illusion datasets remain scarce. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset of optical illusions featuring intermingled animal pairs designed to evoke perceptual ambiguity. We identify generalizable visual concepts, particularly gaze direction and eye cues, as subtle yet impactful features that significantly influence model accuracy. By confronting models with perceptual ambiguity, our findings underscore the importance of concepts in visual learning and provide a foundation for studying bias and alignment between human and machine vision. To make this dataset useful for general purposes, we generate optical illusions systematically with different concepts discussed in our bias mitigation section. The dataset is accessible in Kaggle via https://kaggle.com/datasets/693bf7c6dd2cb45c8a863f9177350c8f9849a9508e9d50526e2ffcc5559a8333.

      <title>Taylor expansion-based Kolmogorov-Arnold network for blind image quality assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has attracted growing interest for its strong function approximation capability. In our previous work, KAN and its variants were explored in score regression for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). However, these models encounter challenges when processing high-dimensional features, leading to limited performance gains and increased computational cost. To address these issues, we propose TaylorKAN that leverages the Taylor expansions as learnable activation functions to enhance local approximation capability. To improve the computational efficiency, network depth reduction and feature dimensionality compression are integrated into the TaylorKAN-based score regression pipeline. On five databases (BID, CLIVE, KonIQ, SPAQ, and FLIVE) with authentic distortions, extensive experiments demonstrate that TaylorKAN consistently outperforms the other KAN-related models, indicating that the local approximation via Taylor expansions is more effective than global approximation using orthogonal functions. Its generalization capacity is validated through inter-database experiments. The findings highlight the potential of TaylorKAN as an efficient and robust model for high-dimensional score regression.</description>

      <title>Learning optimal treatment strategies for intraoperative hypotension using deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods of surgical decision making heavily rely on human experience and prompt actions, which are variable. A data-driven system generating treatment recommendations based on patient states can be a substantial asset in perioperative decision-making, as in cases of intraoperative hypotension, for which suboptimal management is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), a common and morbid postoperative complication. We developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to recommend optimum dose of intravenous (IV) fluid and vasopressors during surgery to avoid intraoperative hypotension and postoperative AKI. We retrospectively analyzed 50,021 surgeries from 42,547 adult patients who underwent major surgery at a quaternary care hospital between June 2014 and September 2020. Of these, 34,186 surgeries were used for model training and 15,835 surgeries were reserved for testing. We developed a Deep Q-Networks based RL model using 16 variables including intraoperative physiologic time series, total dose of IV fluid and vasopressors extracted for every 15-minute epoch. The model replicated 69% of physician's decisions for the dosage of vasopressors and proposed higher or lower dosage of vasopressors than received in 10% and 21% of the treatments, respectively. In terms of IV fluids, the model's recommendations were within 0.05 ml/kg/15 min of the actual dose in 41% of the cases, with higher or lower doses recommended for 27% and 32% of the treatments, respectively. The model resulted in a higher estimated policy value compared to the physicians' actual treatments, as well as random and zero-drug policies. AKI prevalence was the lowest in patients receiving medication dosages that aligned with model's decisions. Our findings suggest that implementation of the model's policy has the potential to reduce postoperative AKI and improve other outcomes driven by intraoperative hypotension.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Classification: A Computationally Efficient CNN with Minimal Accuracy Trade-Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning in medical image analysis has greatly enhanced the accuracy of skin cancer classification. However, current state-of-the-art models, especially those based on transfer learning like ResNet50, come with significant computational overhead, rendering them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained environments. This study proposes a custom CNN model that achieves a 96.7\% reduction in parameters (from 23.9 million in ResNet50 to 692,000) while maintaining a classification accuracy deviation of less than 0.022\%. Our empirical analysis of the HAM10000 dataset reveals that although transfer learning models provide a marginal accuracy improvement of approximately 0.022\%, they result in a staggering 13,216.76\% increase in FLOPs, considerably raising computational costs and inference latency. In contrast, our lightweight CNN architecture, which encompasses only 30.04 million FLOPs compared to ResNet50's 4.00 billion, significantly reduces energy consumption, memory footprint, and inference time. These findings underscore the trade-off between the complexity of deep models and their real-world feasibility, positioning our optimized CNN as a practical solution for mobile and edge-based skin cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>R2R: Efficiently Navigating Divergent Reasoning Paths with Small-Large Model Token Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities at the cost of substantial inference overhead, posing substantial deployment challenges. Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly enhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs' reasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing labels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and R1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math, coding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B, R2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the R1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with comparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling efficiency.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of eXtreme Programming (XP) and the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) in agile Data Science projects. We conducted a case study at the e-commerce company Elo7 to answer the research question: How can the agility of the XP method be integrated with CRISP-DM in Data Science projects? Data was collected through interviews and questionnaires with a Data Science team consisting of data scientists, ML engineers, and data product managers. The results show that 86% of the team frequently or always applies CRISP-DM, while 71% adopt XP practices in their projects. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that it is possible to combine CRISP-DM with XP in Data Science projects, providing a structured and collaborative approach. Finally, the study generated improvement recommendations for the company.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of video generative models has led to a surge in highly realistic synthetic videos, raising ethical concerns related to disinformation and copyright infringement. Recently, video watermarking has been proposed as a mitigation strategy by embedding invisible marks into AI-generated videos to enable subsequent detection. However, the robustness of existing video watermarking methods against both common and adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMarkBench, the first systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of video watermarks under watermark removal and watermark forgery attacks. Our study encompasses a unified dataset generated by three state-of-the-art video generative models, across three video styles, incorporating four watermarking methods and seven aggregation strategies used during detection. We comprehensively evaluate 12 types of perturbations under white-box, black-box, and no-box threat models. Our findings reveal significant vulnerabilities in current watermarking approaches and highlight the urgent need for more robust solutions. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhengyuan-jiang/VideoMarkBench.</description>

      <title>Is Your LLM Overcharging You? Tokenization, Transparency, and Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models require specialized hardware and substantial energy to operate. As a consequence, cloud-based services that provide access to large language models have become very popular. In these services, the price users pay for an output provided by a model depends on the number of tokens the model uses to generate it -- they pay a fixed price per token. In this work, we show that this pricing mechanism creates a financial incentive for providers to strategize and misreport the (number of) tokens a model used to generate an output, and users cannot prove, or even know, whether a provider is overcharging them. However, we also show that, if an unfaithful provider is obliged to be transparent about the generative process used by the model, misreporting optimally without raising suspicion is hard. Nevertheless, as a proof-of-concept, we introduce an efficient heuristic algorithm that allows providers to significantly overcharge users without raising suspicion, highlighting the vulnerability of users under the current pay-per-token pricing mechanism. Further, to completely eliminate the financial incentive to strategize, we introduce a simple incentive-compatible token pricing mechanism. Under this mechanism, the price users pay for an output provided by a model depends on the number of characters of the output -- they pay a fixed price per character. Along the way, to illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$ and $\texttt{Ministral}$ families, and input prompts from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive-scale pretraining has made vision-language models increasingly popular for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval across a broad collection of domains. However, these models do not perform well when used for challenging retrieval tasks, such as instance retrieval in very large-scale image collections. Recent work has shown that linear transformations of VLM features trained for instance retrieval can improve performance by emphasizing subspaces that relate to the domain of interest. In this paper, we explore a more extreme version of this specialization by learning to map a given query to a query-specific feature space transformation. Because this transformation is linear, it can be applied with minimal computational cost to millions of image embeddings, making it effective for large-scale retrieval or re-ranking. Results show that this method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, including those that require many orders of magnitude more computation at query time.</description>

      <title>Explainability of Large Language Models using SMILE: Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and Claude have become incredibly powerful at generating text, but they are still black boxes, so it is hard to understand how they decide what to say. That lack of transparency can be problematic, especially in fields where trust and accountability matter. To help with this, we introduce SMILE, a new method that explains how these models respond to different parts of a prompt. SMILE is model-agnostic and works by slightly changing the input, measuring how the output changes, and then highlighting which words had the most impact. Create simple visual heat maps showing which parts of a prompt matter the most. We tested SMILE on several leading LLMs and used metrics such as accuracy, consistency, stability, and fidelity to show that it gives clear and reliable explanations. By making these models easier to understand, SMILE brings us one step closer to making AI more transparent and trustworthy.</description>

      <title>STACI: Spatio-Temporal Aleatoric Conformal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fitting Gaussian Processes (GPs) provides interpretable aleatoric uncertainty quantification for estimation of spatio-temporal fields. Spatio-temporal deep learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of observations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Frontier Exploration on Graphs with Applications to Network-Based Disease Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem on a $n$-node graph $G$ where each node has an unknown label from a finite set $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, drawn from a joint distribution $P$ that is Markov with respect to $G$. At each step, selecting a node reveals its label and yields a label-dependent reward. The goal is to adaptively choose nodes to maximize expected accumulated discounted rewards. We impose a frontier exploration constraint, where actions are limited to neighbors of previously selected nodes, reflecting practical constraints in settings such as contact tracing and robotic exploration. We design a Gittins index-based policy that applies to general graphs and is provably optimal when $G$ is a forest. Our implementation runs in $O(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Sigma}|^2)$ time while using $O(n \cdot |\mathbf{\Sigma}|^2)$ oracle calls to $P$ and $O(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Sigma}|)$ space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our method consistently outperforms natural baselines, including in non-tree, budget-limited, and undiscounted settings. For example, in HIV testing simulations on real-world sexual interaction networks, our policy detects nearly all positive cases with only half the population tested, substantially outperforming other baselines.</description>

Abstract: Tensors provide a robust framework for managing high-dimensional data. Consequently, tensor analysis has emerged as an active research area in various domains, including machine learning, signal processing, computer vision, graph analysis, and data mining. This study introduces an efficient image storage approach utilizing tensors, aiming to minimize memory to store, bandwidth to transmit and energy to processing. The proposed method organizes original data into a higher-order tensor and applies the Tucker model for compression. Implemented in R, this method is compared to a baseline algorithm. The evaluation focuses on efficient of algorithm measured in term of computational time and the quality of information preserved, using both simulated and real datasets. A detailed analysis of the results is conducted, employing established quantitative metrics, with significant attention paid to sustainability in terms of energy consumption across algorithms.</description>

      <title>LLMPR: A Novel LLM-Driven Transfer Learning based Petition Ranking Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The persistent accumulation of unresolved legal cases, especially within the Indian judiciary, significantly hampers the timely delivery of justice. Manual methods of prioritizing petitions are often prone to inefficiencies and subjective biases further exacerbating delays. To address this issue, we propose LLMPR (Large Language Model-based Petition Ranking), an automated framework that utilizes transfer learning and machine learning to assign priority rankings to legal petitions based on their contextual urgency. Leveraging the ILDC dataset comprising 7,593 annotated petitions, we process unstructured legal text and extract features through various embedding techniques, including DistilBERT, LegalBERT, and MiniLM. These textual embeddings are combined with quantitative indicators such as gap days, rank scores, and word counts to train multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Our experiments demonstrate that Random Forest and Decision Tree models yield superior performance, with accuracy exceeding 99% and a Spearman rank correlation of 0.99. Notably, models using only numerical features achieve nearly optimal ranking results (R2 = 0.988, \r{ho} = 0.998), while LLM-based embeddings offer only marginal gains. These findings suggest that automated petition ranking can effectively streamline judicial workflows, reduce case backlog, and improve fairness in legal prioritization.</description>

      <title>What Data Enables Optimal Decisions? An Exact Characterization for Linear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental question of how informative a dataset is for solving a given decision-making task. In our setting, the dataset provides partial information about unknown parameters that influence task outcomes. Focusing on linear programs, we characterize when a dataset is sufficient to recover an optimal decision, given an uncertainty set on the cost vector. Our main contribution is a sharp geometric characterization that identifies the directions of the cost vector that matter for optimality, relative to the task constraints and uncertainty set. We further develop a practical algorithm that, for a given task, constructs a minimal or least-costly sufficient dataset. Our results reveal that small, well-chosen datasets can often fully determine optimal decisions -- offering a principled foundation for task-aware data selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network models have been widely used to study diverse systems and analyze their dynamic behaviors. Given the structural variability of networks, an intriguing question arises: Can we infer the type of system represented by a network based on its structure? This classification problem involves extracting relevant features from the network. Existing literature has proposed various methods that combine structural measurements and dynamical processes for feature extraction. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to characterize networks using statistics from random walks, which can be particularly informative about network properties. We present the employed statistical metrics and compare their performance on multiple datasets with other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in many cases, often outperforming existing approaches, although some limitations are observed across certain datasets.</description>

      <title>Nearly Dimension-Independent Convergence of Mean-Field Black-Box Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given a mean-field location-scale variational family, black-box variational inference (BBVI) with the reparametrization gradient converges at an almost dimension-independent rate. Specifically, for strongly log-concave and log-smooth targets, the number of iterations for BBVI with a sub-Gaussian family to achieve an objective $\epsilon$-close to the global optimum is $\mathrm{O}(\log d)$, which improves over the $\mathrm{O}(d)$ dependence of full-rank location-scale families. For heavy-tailed families, we provide a weaker $\mathrm{O}(d^{2/k})$ dimension dependence, where $k$ is the number of finite moments. Additionally, if the Hessian of the target log-density is constant, the complexity is free of any explicit dimension dependence. We also prove that our bound on the gradient variance, which is key to our result, cannot be improved using only spectral bounds on the Hessian of the target log-density.</description>

      <title>Are Statistical Methods Obsolete in the Era of Deep Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of AI, neural networks have become increasingly popular for modeling, inference, and prediction, largely due to their potential for universal approximation. With the proliferation of such deep learning models, a question arises: are leaner statistical methods still relevant? To shed insight on this question, we employ the mechanistic nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) inverse problem as a testbed, using physics-informed neural network (PINN) as a representative of the deep learning paradigm and manifold-constrained Gaussian process inference (MAGI) as a representative of statistically principled methods. Through case studies involving the SEIR model from epidemiology and the Lorenz model from chaotic dynamics, we demonstrate that statistical methods are far from obsolete, especially when working with sparse and noisy observations. On tasks such as parameter inference and trajectory reconstruction, statistically principled methods consistently achieve lower bias and variance, while using far fewer parameters and requiring less hyperparameter tuning. Statistical methods can also decisively outperform deep learning models on out-of-sample future prediction, where the absence of relevant data often leads overparameterized models astray. Additionally, we find that statistically principled approaches are more robust to accumulation of numerical imprecision and can represent the underlying system more faithful to the true governing ODEs.</description>

      <title>MIND-Stack: Modular, Interpretable, End-to-End Differentiability for Autonomous Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing robust, efficient navigation algorithms is challenging. Rule-based methods offer interpretability and modularity but struggle with learning from large datasets, while end-to-end neural networks excel in learning but lack transparency and modularity. In this paper, we present MIND-Stack, a modular software stack consisting of a localization network and a Stanley Controller with intermediate human interpretable state representations and end-to-end differentiability. Our approach enables the upstream localization module to reduce the downstream control error, extending its role beyond state estimation. Unlike existing research on differentiable algorithms that either lack modules of the autonomous stack to span from sensor input to actuator output or real-world implementation, MIND-Stack offers both capabilities. We conduct experiments that demonstrate the ability of the localization module to reduce the downstream control loss through its end-to-end differentiability while offering better performance than state-of-the-art algorithms. We showcase sim-to-real capabilities by deploying the algorithm on a real-world embedded autonomous platform with limited computation power and demonstrate simultaneous training of both the localization and controller towards one goal. While MIND-Stack shows good results, we discuss the incorporation of additional modules from the autonomous navigation pipeline in the future, promising even greater stability and performance in the next iterations of the framework.</description>

      <title>Moment kernels: a simple and scalable approach for equivariance to rotations and reflections in deep convolutional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The principle of translation equivariance (if an input image is translated an output image should be translated by the same amount), led to the development of convolutional neural networks that revolutionized machine vision. Other symmetries, like rotations and reflections, play a similarly critical role, especially in biomedical image analysis, but exploiting these symmetries has not seen wide adoption. We hypothesize that this is partially due to the mathematical complexity of methods used to exploit these symmetries, which often rely on representation theory, a bespoke concept in differential geometry and group theory. In this work, we show that the same equivariance can be achieved using a simple form of convolution kernels that we call ``moment kernels,'' and prove that all equivariant kernels must take this form. These are a set of radially symmetric functions of a spatial position $x$, multiplied by powers of the components of $x$ or the identity matrix. We implement equivariant neural networks using standard convolution modules, and provide architectures to execute several biomedical image analysis tasks that depend on equivariance principles: classification (outputs are invariant under orthogonal transforms), 3D image registration (outputs transform like a vector), and cell segmentation (quadratic forms defining ellipses transform like a matrix).</description>

      <title>What is Adversarial Training for Diffusion Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We answer the question in the title, showing that adversarial training (AT) for diffusion models (DMs) fundamentally differs from classifiers: while AT in classifiers enforces output invariance, AT in DMs requires equivariance to keep the diffusion process aligned with the data distribution. AT is a way to enforce smoothness in the diffusion flow, improving robustness to outliers and corrupted data. Unlike prior art, our method makes no assumptions about the noise model and integrates seamlessly into diffusion training by adding random noise, similar to randomized smoothing, or adversarial noise, akin to AT. This enables intrinsic capabilities such as handling noisy data, dealing with extreme variability such as outliers, preventing memorization, and improving robustness. We rigorously evaluate our approach with proof-of-concept datasets with known distributions in low- and high-dimensional space, thereby taking a perfect measure of errors; we further evaluate on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, CelebA and LSUN Bedroom, showing strong performance under severe noise, data corruption, and iterative adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Learning to See More: UAS-Guided Super-Resolution of Satellite Imagery for Precision Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and satellites are key data sources for precision agriculture, yet each presents trade-offs. Satellite data offer broad spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage but lack the resolution needed for many precision farming applications, while UAS provide high spatial detail but are limited by coverage and cost, especially for hyperspectral data. This study presents a novel framework that fuses satellite and UAS imagery using super-resolution methods. By integrating data across spatial, spectral, and temporal domains, we leverage the strengths of both platforms cost-effectively. We use estimation of cover crop biomass and nitrogen (N) as a case study to evaluate our approach. By spectrally extending UAS RGB data to the vegetation red edge and near-infrared regions, we generate high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and improve biomass and N estimation accuracy by 18% and 31%, respectively. Our results show that UAS data need only be collected from a subset of fields and time points. Farmers can then 1) enhance the spectral detail of UAS RGB imagery; 2) increase the spatial resolution by using satellite data; and 3) extend these enhancements spatially and across the growing season at the frequency of the satellite flights. Our SRCNN-based spectral extension model shows considerable promise for model transferability over other cropping systems in the Upper and Lower Chesapeake Bay regions. Additionally, it remains effective even when cloud-free satellite data are unavailable, relying solely on the UAS RGB input. The spatial extension model produces better biomass and N predictions than models built on raw UAS RGB images. Once trained with targeted UAS RGB data, the spatial extension model allows farmers to stop repeated UAS flights. While we introduce super-resolution advances, the core contribution is a lightweight and scalable system for affordable on-farm use.</description>

      <title>FRAMES-VQA: Benchmarking Fine-Tuning Robustness across Multi-Modal Shifts in Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) systems face significant challenges when adapting to real-world data shifts, especially in multi-modal contexts. While robust fine-tuning strategies are essential for maintaining performance across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, current evaluation settings are primarily unimodal or particular to some types of OOD, offering limited insight into the complexities of multi-modal contexts. In this work, we propose a new benchmark FRAMES-VQA (Fine-Tuning Robustness across Multi-Modal Shifts in VQA) for evaluating robust fine-tuning for VQA tasks. We utilize ten existing VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, IV-VQA, VQA-CP, OK-VQA and others, and categorize them into ID, near and far OOD datasets covering uni-modal, multi-modal and adversarial distribution shifts. We first conduct a comprehensive comparison of existing robust fine-tuning methods. We then quantify the distribution shifts by calculating the Mahalanobis distance using uni-modal and multi-modal embeddings extracted from various models. Further, we perform an extensive analysis to explore the interactions between uni- and multi-modal shifts as well as modality importance for ID and OOD samples. These analyses offer valuable guidance on developing more robust fine-tuning methods to handle multi-modal distribution shifts.

      <title>Beyond 1D: Vision Transformers and Multichannel Signal Images for PPG-to-ECG Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing ECG from PPG is a promising yet challenging task. While recent advancements in generative models have significantly improved ECG reconstruction, accurately capturing fine-grained waveform features remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose a novel PPG-to-ECG reconstruction method that leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the core network. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on single-channel PPG, our method employs a four-channel signal image representation, incorporating the original PPG, its first-order difference, second-order difference, and area under the curve. This multi-channel design enriches feature extraction by preserving both temporal and physiological variations within the PPG. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism in ViT, our approach effectively captures both inter-beat and intra-beat dependencies, leading to more robust and accurate ECG reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing 1D convolution-based approaches, achieving up to 29% reduction in PRD and 15% reduction in RMSE. The proposed approach also produces improvements in other evaluation metrics, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in reconstructing ECG signals. Furthermore, to ensure a clinically relevant evaluation, we introduce new performance metrics, including QRS area error, PR interval error, RT interval error, and RT amplitude difference error. Our findings suggest that integrating a four-channel signal image representation with the self-attention mechanism of ViT enables more effective extraction of informative PPG features and improved modeling of beat-to-beat variations for PPG-to-ECG mapping. Beyond demonstrating the potential of PPG as a viable alternative for heart activity monitoring, our approach opens new avenues for cyclic signal analysis and prediction.</description>

      <title>Global Minimizers of $\ell^p$-Regularized Objectives Yield the Sparsest ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks can interpolate a given dataset in many different ways, prompting the fundamental question: which among these solutions should we prefer, and what explicit regularization strategies will provably yield these solutions? This paper addresses the challenge of finding the sparsest interpolating ReLU network -- i.e., the network with the fewest nonzero parameters or neurons -- a goal with wide-ranging implications for efficiency, generalization, interpretability, theory, and model compression. Unlike post hoc pruning approaches, we propose a continuous, almost-everywhere differentiable training objective whose global minima are guaranteed to correspond to the sparsest single-hidden-layer ReLU networks that fit the data. This result marks a conceptual advance: it recasts the combinatorial problem of sparse interpolation as a smooth optimization task, potentially enabling the use of gradient-based training methods. Our objective is based on minimizing $\ell^p$ quasinorms of the weights for $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$, a classical sparsity-promoting strategy in finite-dimensional settings. However, applying these ideas to neural networks presents new challenges: the function class is infinite-dimensional, and the weights are learned using a highly nonconvex objective. We prove that, under our formulation, global minimizers correspond exactly to sparsest solutions. Our work lays a foundation for understanding when and how continuous sparsity-inducing objectives can be leveraged to recover sparse networks through training.</description>

      <title>A General-Purpose Theorem for High-Probability Bounds of Stochastic Approximation with Polyak Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyak-Ruppert averaging is a widely used technique to achieve the optimal asymptotic variance of stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms, yet its high-probability performance guarantees remain underexplored in general settings. In this paper, we present a general framework for establishing non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the error of averaged SA iterates. Our approach assumes access to individual concentration bounds for the unaveraged iterates and yields a sharp bound on the averaged iterates. We also construct an example, showing the tightness of our result up to constant multiplicative factors. As direct applications, we derive tight concentration bounds for contractive SA algorithms and for algorithms such as temporal difference learning and Q-learning with averaging, obtaining new bounds in settings where traditional analysis is challenging.</description>

      <title>PolarGrad: A Class of Matrix-Gradient Optimizers from a Unifying Preconditioning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-growing scale of deep learning models and datasets underscores the critical importance of efficient optimization methods. While preconditioned gradient methods such as Adam and AdamW are the de facto optimizers for training neural networks and large language models, structure-aware preconditioned optimizers like Shampoo and Muon, which utilize the matrix structure of gradients, have demonstrated promising evidence of faster convergence. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework for analyzing "matrix-aware" preconditioned methods, which not only sheds light on the effectiveness of Muon and related optimizers but also leads to a class of new structure-aware preconditioned methods. A key contribution of this framework is its precise distinction between preconditioning strategies that treat neural network weights as vectors (addressing curvature anisotropy) versus those that consider their matrix structure (addressing gradient anisotropy). This perspective provides new insights into several empirical phenomena in language model pre-training, including Adam's training instabilities, Muon's accelerated convergence, and the necessity of learning rate warmup for Adam. Building upon this framework, we introduce PolarGrad, a new class of preconditioned optimization methods based on the polar decomposition of matrix-valued gradients. As a special instance, PolarGrad includes Muon with updates scaled by the nuclear norm of the gradients. We provide numerical implementations of these methods, leveraging efficient numerical polar decomposition algorithms for enhanced convergence. Our extensive evaluations across diverse matrix optimization problems and language model pre-training tasks demonstrate that PolarGrad outperforms both Adam and Muon.</description>

      <title>Voice Quality Dimensions as Interpretable Primitives for Speaking Style for Atypical Speech and Affect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perceptual voice quality dimensions describe key characteristics of atypical speech and other speech modulations. Here we develop and evaluate voice quality models for seven voice and speech dimensions (intelligibility, imprecise consonants, harsh voice, naturalness, monoloudness, monopitch, and breathiness). Probes were trained on the public Speech Accessibility (SAP) project dataset with 11,184 samples from 434 speakers, using embeddings from frozen pre-trained models as features. We found that our probes had both strong performance and strong generalization across speech elicitation categories in the SAP dataset. We further validated zero-shot performance on additional datasets, encompassing unseen languages and tasks: Italian atypical speech, English atypical speech, and affective speech. The strong zero-shot performance and the interpretability of results across an array of evaluations suggests the utility of using voice quality dimensions in speaking style-related tasks.</description>

      <title>Representative Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce "representative generation," extending the theoretical framework for generation proposed by Kleinberg et al. (2024) and formalized by Li et al. (2024), to additionally address diversity and bias concerns in generative models. Our notion requires outputs of a generative model to proportionally represent groups of interest from the training data. We characterize representative uniform and non-uniform generation, introducing the "group closure dimension" as a key combinatorial quantity. For representative generation in the limit, we analyze both information-theoretic and computational aspects, demonstrating feasibility for countably infinite hypothesis classes and collections of groups under certain conditions, but proving a negative result for computability using only membership queries. This contrasts with Kleinberg et al.'s (2024) positive results for standard generation in the limit. Our findings provide a rigorous foundation for developing more diverse and representative generative models.</description>

      <title>Music Source Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Music Source Restoration (MSR), a novel task addressing the gap between idealized source separation and real-world music production. Current Music Source Separation (MSS) approaches assume mixtures are simple sums of sources, ignoring signal degradations employed during music production like equalization, compression, and reverb. MSR models mixtures as degraded sums of individually degraded sources, with the goal of recovering original, undegraded signals. Due to the lack of data for MSR, we present RawStems, a dataset annotation of 578 songs with unprocessed source signals organized into 8 primary and 17 secondary instrument groups, totaling 354.13 hours. To the best of our knowledge, RawStems is the first dataset that contains unprocessed music stems with hierarchical categories. We consider spectral filtering, dynamic range compression, harmonic distortion, reverb and lossy codec as possible degradations, and establish U-Former as a baseline method, demonstrating the feasibility of MSR on our dataset. We release the RawStems dataset annotations, degradation simulation pipeline, training code and pre-trained models to be publicly available.</description>

      <title>UniMoGen: Universal Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion generation is a cornerstone of computer graphics, animation, gaming, and robotics, enabling the creation of realistic and varied character movements. A significant limitation of existing methods is their reliance on specific skeletal structures, which restricts their versatility across different characters. To overcome this, we introduce UniMoGen, a novel UNet-based diffusion model designed for skeleton-agnostic motion generation. UniMoGen can be trained on motion data from diverse characters, such as humans and animals, without the need for a predefined maximum number of joints. By dynamically processing only the necessary joints for each character, our model achieves both skeleton agnosticism and computational efficiency. Key features of UniMoGen include controllability via style and trajectory inputs, and the ability to continue motions from past frames. We demonstrate UniMoGen's effectiveness on the 100style dataset, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse character motion generation. Furthermore, when trained on both the 100style and LAFAN1 datasets, which use different skeletons, UniMoGen achieves high performance and improved efficiency across both skeletons. These results highlight UniMoGen's potential to advance motion generation by providing a flexible, efficient, and controllable solution for a wide range of character animations.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Learning Framework to Solve the Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework to solve the infinite-horizon optimal control problem of nonlinear systems. In particular, since PINNs are generally able to solve a class of partial differential equations (PDEs), they can be employed to learn the value function of the infinite-horizon optimal control problem via solving the associated steady-state Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. However, an issue here is that the steady-state HJB equation generally yields multiple solutions; hence if PINNs are directly employed to it, they may end up approximating a solution that is different from the optimal value function of the problem. We tackle this by instead applying PINNs to a finite-horizon variant of the steady-state HJB that has a unique solution, and which uniformly approximates the optimal value function as the horizon increases. An algorithm to verify if the chosen horizon is large enough is also given, as well as a method to extend it -- with reduced computations and robustness to approximation errors -- in case it is not. Unlike many existing methods, the proposed technique works well with non-polynomial basis functions, does not require prior knowledge of a stabilizing controller, and does not perform iterative policy evaluations. Simulations are performed, which verify and clarify theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering for dependent community Hawkes process models of temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks observed continuously over time through timestamped relational events data are commonly encountered in application settings including online social media communications, financial transactions, and international relations. Temporal networks often exhibit community structure and strong dependence patterns among node pairs. This dependence can be modeled through mutual excitations, where an interaction event from a sender to a receiver node increases the possibility of future events among other node pairs.
  We provide statistical results for a class of models that we call dependent community Hawkes (DCH) models, which combine the stochastic block model with mutually exciting Hawkes processes for modeling both community structure and dependence among node pairs, respectively. We derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on the misclustering error of spectral clustering on the event count matrix as a function of the number of nodes and communities, time duration, and the amount of dependence in the model. Our result leverages recent results on bounding an appropriate distance between a multivariate Hawkes process count vector and a Gaussian vector, along with results from random matrix theory. We also propose a DCH model that incorporates only self and reciprocal excitation along with highly scalable parameter estimation using a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator that we demonstrate to be consistent for growing network size and time duration.</description>

      <title>Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion$/$flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

      <title>Targeted Unlearning Using Perturbed Sign Gradient Methods With Applications On Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples from a trained model without full retraining. While prior work has largely focused on privacy-motivated settings, we recast unlearning as a general-purpose tool for post-deployment model revision. Specifically, we focus on utilizing unlearning in clinical contexts where data shifts, device deprecation, and policy changes are common. To this end, we propose a bilevel optimization formulation of boundary-based unlearning that can be solved using iterative algorithms. We provide convergence guarantees when first-order algorithms are used to unlearn. Our method introduces tunable loss design for controlling the forgetting-retention tradeoff and supports novel model composition strategies that merge the strengths of distinct unlearning runs. Across benchmark and real-world clinical imaging datasets, our approach outperforms baselines on both forgetting and retention metrics, including scenarios involving imaging devices and anatomical outliers. This work establishes machine unlearning as a modular, practical alternative to retraining for real-world model maintenance in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Foundation Regressor on Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In science, we are interested not only in forecasting but also in understanding how predictions are made, specifically what the interpretable underlying model looks like. Data-driven machine learning technology can significantly streamline the complex and time-consuming traditional manual process of discovering scientific laws, helping us gain insights into fundamental issues in modern science. In this work, we introduce a pre-trained symbolic foundation regressor that can effectively compress complex data with numerous interacting variables while producing interpretable physical representations. Our model has been rigorously tested on non-network symbolic regression, symbolic regression on complex networks, and the inference of network dynamics across various domains, including physics, biochemistry, ecology, and epidemiology. The results indicate a remarkable improvement in equation inference efficiency, being three times more effective than baseline approaches while maintaining accurate predictions. Furthermore, we apply our model to uncover more intuitive laws of interaction transmission from global epidemic outbreak data, achieving optimal data fitting. This model extends the application boundary of pre-trained symbolic regression models to complex networks, and we believe it provides a foundational solution for revealing the hidden mechanisms behind changes in complex phenomena, enhancing interpretability, and inspiring further scientific discoveries.</description>

      <title>SVRPBench: A Realistic Benchmark for Stochastic Vehicle Routing Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust routing under uncertainty is central to real-world logistics, yet most benchmarks assume static, idealized settings. We present SVRPBench, the first open benchmark to capture high-fidelity stochastic dynamics in vehicle routing at urban scale. Spanning more than 500 instances with up to 1000 customers, it simulates realistic delivery conditions: time-dependent congestion, log-normal delays, probabilistic accidents, and empirically grounded time windows for residential and commercial clients. Our pipeline generates diverse, constraint-rich scenarios, including multi-depot and multi-vehicle setups. Benchmarking reveals that state-of-the-art RL solvers like POMO and AM degrade by over 20% under distributional shift, while classical and metaheuristic methods remain robust. To enable reproducible research, we release the dataset and evaluation suite. SVRPBench challenges the community to design solvers that generalize beyond synthetic assumptions and adapt to real-world uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Almost Linear Convergence under Minimal Score Assumptions: Quantized Transition Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in data generation across various domains, yet their efficiency remains constrained by two critical limitations: (1) the local adjacency structure of the forward Markov process, which restricts long-range transitions in the data space, and (2) inherent biases introduced during the simulation of time-inhomogeneous reverse denoising processes. To address these challenges, we propose Quantized Transition Diffusion (QTD), a novel approach that integrates data quantization with discrete diffusion dynamics. Our method first transforms the continuous data distribution $p_*$ into a discrete one $q_*$ via histogram approximation and binary encoding, enabling efficient representation in a structured discrete latent space. We then design a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with Hamming distance-based transitions as the forward process, which inherently supports long-range movements in the original data space. For reverse-time sampling, we introduce a \textit{truncated uniformization} technique to simulate the reverse CTMC, which can provably provide unbiased generation from $q_*$ under minimal score assumptions. Through a novel KL dynamic analysis of the reverse CTMC, we prove that QTD can generate samples with $O(d\ln^2(d/\epsilon))$ score evaluations in expectation to approximate the $d$--dimensional target distribution $p_*$ within an $\epsilon$ error tolerance. Our method not only establishes state-of-the-art inference efficiency but also advances the theoretical foundations of diffusion-based generative modeling by unifying discrete and continuous diffusion paradigms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present RenderFormer, a neural rendering pipeline that directly renders an image from a triangle-based representation of a scene with full global illumination effects and that does not require per-scene training or fine-tuning. Instead of taking a physics-centric approach to rendering, we formulate rendering as a sequence-to-sequence transformation where a sequence of tokens representing triangles with reflectance properties is converted to a sequence of output tokens representing small patches of pixels. RenderFormer follows a two stage pipeline: a view-independent stage that models triangle-to-triangle light transport, and a view-dependent stage that transforms a token representing a bundle of rays to the corresponding pixel values guided by the triangle-sequence from the view-independent stage. Both stages are based on the transformer architecture and are learned with minimal prior constraints. We demonstrate and evaluate RenderFormer on scenes with varying complexity in shape and light transport.</description>

      <title>Subspecialty-Specific Foundation Model for Intelligent Gastrointestinal Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases represent a clinically significant burden, necessitating precise diagnostic approaches to optimize patient outcomes. Conventional histopathological diagnosis, heavily reliant on the subjective interpretation of pathologists, suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations and address the lack of pathology-specific foundation models for GI diseases, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on more than 353 million image patches from over 200,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, molecular prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation, particularly in diagnostically ambiguous cases and resolution-agnostic tissue classification.We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.6% sensitivity across 9 independent medical institutions nationwide. The outstanding performance of Digepath highlights its potential to bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also establishes a transferable paradigm for other pathology subspecialties.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Group Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group synchronization is the problem of determining reliable global estimates from noisy local measurements on networks. The typical task for group synchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a way that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information about local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on a hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the hyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group synchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image processing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of higher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations. Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions which establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group synchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general higher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on higher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm. We discuss theoretical guarantees for our framework, including convergence analyses under outliers and noise. Finally, we show potential advantages of our method through numerical experiments. In particular, we show that in certain cases our higher-order method applied to rotational and angular synchronization outperforms standard pairwise synchronization methods and is more robust to outliers. We also show that our method has comparable performance on simulated cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data compared to a standard cryo-EM reconstruction package.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal RAG: Sub-dimensional Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation increasingly demands access to domain-specific, fine-grained, and rapidly evolving knowledge that pretrained models cannot fully capture. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval and generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Reward-Independent Messaging for Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), effective communication improves agent performance, particularly under partial observability. We propose MARL-CPC, a framework that enables communication among fully decentralized, independent agents without parameter sharing. MARL-CPC incorporates a message learning model based on collective predictive coding (CPC) from emergent communication research. Unlike conventional methods that treat messages as part of the action space and assume cooperation, MARL-CPC links messages to state inference, supporting communication in non-cooperative, reward-independent settings. We introduce two algorithms -Bandit-CPC and IPPO-CPC- and evaluate them in non-cooperative MARL tasks. Benchmarks show that both outperform standard message-as-action approaches, establishing effective communication even when messages offer no direct benefit to the sender. These results highlight MARL-CPC's potential for enabling coordination in complex, decentralized environments.</description>

      <title>Locking-Free Training of Physics-Informed Neural Network for Solving Nearly Incompressible Elasticity Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to divergence instability, the accuracy of low-order conforming finite element methods for nearly incompressible homogeneous elasticity equations deteriorates as the Lam\'e coefficient $\lambda\to\infty$, or equivalently as the Poisson ratio $\nu\to1/2$. This phenomenon, known as locking or non-robustness, remains not fully understood despite extensive investigation. In this paper, we propose a robust method based on a fundamentally different, machine-learning-driven approach. Leveraging recently developed Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), we address the numerical solution of linear elasticity equations governing nearly incompressible materials. The core idea of our method is to appropriately decompose the given equations to alleviate the extreme imbalance in the coefficients, while simultaneously solving both the forward and inverse problems to recover the solutions of the decomposed systems as well as the associated external conditions. Through various numerical experiments, including constant, variable and parametric Lam\'e coefficients, we illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Align-DA: Align Score-based Atmospheric Data Assimilation with Multiple Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) aims to estimate the full state of a dynamical system by combining partial and noisy observations with a prior model forecast, commonly referred to as the background. In atmospheric applications, this problem is fundamentally ill-posed due to the sparsity of observations relative to the high-dimensional state space. Traditional methods address this challenge by simplifying background priors to regularize the solution, which are empirical and require continual tuning for application. Inspired by alignment techniques in text-to-image diffusion models, we propose Align-DA, which formulates DA as a generative process and uses reward signals to guide background priors, replacing manual tuning with data-driven alignment. Specifically, we train a score-based model in the latent space to approximate the background-conditioned prior, and align it using three complementary reward signals for DA: (1) assimilation accuracy, (2) forecast skill initialized from the assimilated state, and (3) physical adherence of the analysis fields. Experiments with multiple reward signals demonstrate consistent improvements in analysis quality across different evaluation metrics and observation-guidance strategies. These results show that preference alignment, implemented as a soft constraint, can automatically adapt complex background priors tailored to DA, offering a promising new direction for advancing the field.</description>

      <title>Learning Curves of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a canonical problem in kernel regression: how good are the model performances when it is trained by the popular online first-order algorithms, compared to the offline ones, such as ridge and ridgeless regression? In this paper, we analyze the foundational single-pass Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in kernel regression under source condition where the optimal predictor can even not belong to the RKHS, i.e. the model is misspecified. Specifically, we focus on the inner product kernel over the sphere and characterize the exact orders of the excess risk curves under different scales of sample sizes $n$ concerning the input dimension $d$. Surprisingly, we show that SGD achieves min-max optimal rates up to constants among all the scales, without suffering the saturation, a prevalent phenomenon observed in (ridge) regression, except when the model is highly misspecified and the learning is in a final stage where $n\gg d^{\gamma}$ with any constant $\gamma &gt;0$. The main reason for SGD to overcome the curse of saturation is the exponentially decaying step size schedule, a common practice in deep neural network training. As a byproduct, we provide the \emph{first} provable advantage of the scheme over the iterative averaging method in the common setting.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Reasoning for Embodied Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state wavefunction for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) of up to 100 spins and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems of up 50 spins. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &amp; $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</description>

      <title>PADAM: Parallel averaged Adam reduces the error for stochastic optimization in scientific machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Averaging techniques such as Ruppert--Polyak averaging and exponential movering averaging (EMA) are powerful approaches to accelerate optimization procedures of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods such as the popular ADAM optimizer. However, depending on the specific optimization problem under consideration, the type and the parameters for the averaging need to be adjusted to achieve the smallest optimization error. In this work we propose an averaging approach, which we refer to as parallel averaged ADAM (PADAM), in which we compute parallely different averaged variants of ADAM and during the training process dynamically select the variant with the smallest optimization error. A central feature of this approach is that this procedure requires no more gradient evaluations than the usual ADAM optimizer as each of the averaged trajectories relies on the same underlying ADAM trajectory and thus on the same underlying gradients. We test the proposed PADAM optimizer in 13 stochastic optimization and deep neural network (DNN) learning problems and compare its performance with known optimizers from the literature such as standard SGD, momentum SGD, Adam with and without EMA, and ADAMW. In particular, we apply the compared optimizers to physics-informed neural network, deep Galerkin, deep backward stochastic differential equation and deep Kolmogorov approximations for boundary value partial differential equation problems from scientific machine learning, as well as to DNN approximations for optimal control and optimal stopping problems. In nearly all of the considered examples PADAM achieves, sometimes among others and sometimes exclusively, essentially the smallest optimization error. This work thus strongly suggest to consider PADAM for scientific machine learning problems and also motivates further research for adaptive averaging procedures within the training of DNNs.</description>

      <title>High Volume Rate 3D Ultrasound Reconstruction with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound enables real-time volumetric visualization of anatomical structures. Unlike traditional 2D ultrasound, 3D imaging reduces the reliance on precise probe orientation, potentially making ultrasound more accessible to clinicians with varying levels of experience and improving automated measurements and post-exam analysis. However, achieving both high volume rates and high image quality remains a significant challenge. While 3D diverging waves can provide high volume rates, they suffer from limited tissue harmonic generation and increased multipath effects, which degrade image quality. One compromise is to retain the focusing in elevation while leveraging unfocused diverging waves in the lateral direction to reduce the number of transmissions per elevation plane. Reaching the volume rates achieved by full 3D diverging waves, however, requires dramatically undersampling the number of elevation planes. Subsequently, to render the full volume, simple interpolation techniques are applied. This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D ultrasound reconstruction from a reduced set of elevation planes by employing diffusion models (DMs) to achieve increased spatial and temporal resolution. We compare both traditional and supervised deep learning-based interpolation methods on a 3D cardiac ultrasound dataset. Our results show that DM-based reconstruction consistently outperforms the baselines in image quality and downstream task performance. Additionally, we accelerate inference by leveraging the temporal consistency inherent to ultrasound sequences. Finally, we explore the robustness of the proposed method by exploiting the probabilistic nature of diffusion posterior sampling to quantify reconstruction uncertainty and demonstrate improved recall on out-of-distribution data with synthetic anomalies under strong subsampling.</description>

      <title>ReinFlow: Fine-tuning Flow Matching Policy with Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose ReinFlow, a simple yet effective online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that fine-tunes a family of flow matching policies for continuous robotic control. Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects learnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow into a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood computation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training stability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants, including Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very few or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative locomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual input and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained an average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged locomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared to state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate of the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved an average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or even one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM policies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%.

      <title>Knowledge Base Construction for Knowledge-Augmented Text-to-SQL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL aims to translate natural language queries into SQL statements, which is practical as it enables anyone to easily retrieve the desired information from databases. Recently, many existing approaches tackle this problem with Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their strong capability in understanding user queries and generating corresponding SQL code. Yet, the parametric knowledge in LLMs might be limited to covering all the diverse and domain-specific queries that require grounding in various database schemas, which makes generated SQLs less accurate oftentimes. To tackle this, we propose constructing the knowledge base for text-to-SQL, a foundational source of knowledge, from which we retrieve and generate the necessary knowledge for given queries. In particular, unlike existing approaches that either manually annotate knowledge or generate only a few pieces of knowledge for each query, our knowledge base is comprehensive, which is constructed based on a combination of all the available questions and their associated database schemas along with their relevant knowledge, and can be reused for unseen databases from different datasets and domains. We validate our approach on multiple text-to-SQL datasets, considering both the overlapping and non-overlapping database scenarios, where it outperforms relevant baselines substantially.</description>

      <title>On the Transferability and Discriminability of Repersentation Learning in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we addressed the limitation of relying solely on distribution alignment and source-domain empirical risk minimization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). Our information-theoretic analysis showed that this standard adversarial-based framework neglects the discriminability of target-domain features, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this theoretical-practical gap, we defined "good representation learning" as guaranteeing both transferability and discriminability, and proved that an additional loss term targeting target-domain discriminability is necessary. Building on these insights, we proposed a novel adversarial-based UDA framework that explicitly integrates a domain alignment objective with a discriminability-enhancing constraint. Instantiated as Domain-Invariant Representation Learning with Global and Local Consistency (RLGLC), our method leverages Asymmetrically-Relaxed Wasserstein of Wasserstein Distance (AR-WWD) to address class imbalance and semantic dimension weighting, and employs a local consistency mechanism to preserve fine-grained target-domain discriminative information. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that RLGLC consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, confirming the value of our theoretical perspective and underscoring the necessity of enforcing both transferability and discriminability in adversarial-based UDA.</description>

      <title>Efficient Dynamic Shielding for Parametric Safety Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shielding has emerged as a promising approach for ensuring safety of AI-controlled autonomous systems. The algorithmic goal is to compute a shield, which is a runtime safety enforcement tool that needs to monitor and intervene the AI controller's actions if safety could be compromised otherwise. Traditional shields are designed statically for a specific safety requirement. Therefore, if the safety requirement changes at runtime due to changing operating conditions, the shield needs to be recomputed from scratch, causing delays that could be fatal. We introduce dynamic shields for parametric safety specifications, which are succinctly represented sets of all possible safety specifications that may be encountered at runtime. Our dynamic shields are statically designed for a given safety parameter set, and are able to dynamically adapt as the true safety specification (permissible by the parameters) is revealed at runtime. The main algorithmic novelty lies in the dynamic adaptation procedure, which is a simple and fast algorithm that utilizes known features of standard safety shields, like maximal permissiveness. We report experimental results for a robot navigation problem in unknown territories, where the safety specification evolves as new obstacles are discovered at runtime. In our experiments, the dynamic shields took a few minutes for their offline design, and took between a fraction of a second and a few seconds for online adaptation at each step, whereas the brute-force online recomputation approach was up to 5 times slower.</description>

      <title>Curse of High Dimensionality Issue in Transformer for Long-context Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal} computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task}, enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.Code is available at https://github.com/bolixinyu/DynamicGroupAttention.</description>

      <title>RAD: Redundancy-Aware Distillation for Hybrid Models via Self-Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid models combining Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs) are promising for balancing performance and efficiency. However, optimizing these hybrid models, particularly by addressing the potential redundancy inherent within the Transformer components, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RAD (Redundancy-Aware Distillation), a novel framework that uses self-speculative decoding as a diagnostic tool to identify redundant attention layers within the model. These identified layers are then selectively replaced with SSM components, followed by targeted (self-)distillation. Specifically, RAD focuses knowledge transfer on the components identified as redundant, considering architectural changes and specific weight initialization strategies. We experimentally demonstrate that self-distillation using RAD significantly surpasses the performance of the original base model on mathematical and coding tasks. Furthermore, RAD is also effective in standard knowledge distillation settings, achieving up to approximately 2x faster convergence compared to baseline methods. Notably, while a baseline model distilled from a Llama-3.1 70B teacher achieves scores of 46.17 on GSM8K and 22.75 on CRUX, RAD achieves significantly higher scores of 71.27 on GSM8K and 28.25 on CRUX, even when using a much smaller Llama-3.1 8B teacher. RAD offers a new pathway for efficient optimization and performance enhancement in the distillation of hybrid models.</description>

      <title>Limited Generalizability in Argument Mining: State-Of-The-Art Models Learn Datasets, Not Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying arguments is a necessary prerequisite for various tasks in automated discourse analysis, particularly within contexts such as political debates, online discussions, and scientific reasoning. In addition to theoretical advances in understanding the constitution of arguments, a significant body of research has emerged around practical argument mining, supported by a growing number of publicly available datasets. On these benchmarks, BERT-like transformers have consistently performed best, reinforcing the belief that such models are broadly applicable across diverse contexts of debate. This study offers the first large-scale re-evaluation of such state-of-the-art models, with a specific focus on their ability to generalize in identifying arguments. We evaluate four transformers, three standard and one enhanced with contrastive pre-training for better generalization, on 17 English sentence-level datasets as most relevant to the task. Our findings show that, to varying degrees, these models tend to rely on lexical shortcuts tied to content words, suggesting that apparent progress may often be driven by dataset-specific cues rather than true task alignment. While the models achieve strong results on familiar benchmarks, their performance drops markedly when applied to unseen datasets. Nonetheless, incorporating both task-specific pre-training and joint benchmark training proves effective in enhancing both robustness and generalization.</description>

      <title>Unifying Continuous and Discrete Text Diffusion with Non-simultaneous Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation, with recent works falling into two main categories: discrete and continuous diffusion models. Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption independently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion progress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion models map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the diffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\underline{N}}on-simultan\textbf{\underline{e}}ous C\textbf{\underline{o}}ntinuous \textbf{\underline{Diff}}usion Models (NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both discrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion process for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising paradigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively modulate the denoising progress based on token semantics. Furthermore, NeoDiff utilizes an optimized schedule for inference to ensure more precise noise control and improved performance. Our approach unifies the theories of discrete and continuous diffusion models, offering a more principled and effective framework for text generation. Experimental results on several text generation tasks demonstrate NeoDiff's superior performance compared to baselines of non-autoregressive continuous and discrete diffusion models, iterative-based methods and autoregressive diffusion-based methods. These results highlight NeoDiff's potential as a powerful tool for generating high-quality text and advancing the field of diffusion-based text generation.</description>

      <title>Speculative Decoding Meets Quantization: Compatibility Evaluation and Hierarchical Framework Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding and quantization effectively accelerate memory-bound inference of large language models. Speculative decoding mitigates the memory bandwidth bottleneck by verifying multiple tokens within a single forward pass, which increases computational effort. Quantization achieves this optimization by compressing weights and activations into lower bit-widths and also reduces computations via low-bit matrix multiplications. To further leverage their strengths, we investigate the integration of these two techniques. Surprisingly, experiments applying the advanced speculative decoding method EAGLE-2 to various quantized models reveal that the memory benefits from 4-bit weight quantization are diminished by the computational load from speculative decoding. Specifically, verifying a tree-style draft incurs significantly more time overhead than a single-token forward pass on 4-bit weight quantized models. This finding led to our new speculative decoding design: a hierarchical framework that employs a small model as an intermediate stage to turn tree-style drafts into sequence drafts, leveraging the memory access benefits of the target quantized model. Experimental results show that our hierarchical approach achieves a 2.78$\times$ speedup across various tasks for the 4-bit weight Llama-3-70B model on an A100 GPU, outperforming EAGLE-2 by 1.31$\times$.

      <title>Physics-inspired Generative AI models via real hardware-based noisy quantum diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Diffusion Models (QDMs) are an emerging paradigm in Generative AI that aims to use quantum properties to improve the performances of their classical counterparts. However, existing algorithms are not easily scalable due to the limitations of near-term quantum devices. Following our previous work on QDMs, here we propose and implement two physics-inspired protocols. In the first, we use the formalism of quantum stochastic walks, showing that a specific interplay of quantum and classical dynamics in the forward process produces statistically more robust models generating sets of MNIST images with lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) than using totally classical dynamics. In the second approach, we realize an algorithm to generate images by exploiting the intrinsic noise of real IBM quantum hardware with only four qubits. Our work could be a starting point to pave the way for new scenarios for large-scale algorithms in quantum Generative AI, where quantum noise is neither mitigated nor corrected, but instead exploited as a useful resource.</description>

      <title>Judging Quality Across Languages: A Multilingual Approach to Pretraining Data Filtering with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality multilingual training data is essential for effectively pretraining large language models (LLMs). Yet, the availability of suitable open-source multilingual datasets remains limited. Existing state-of-the-art datasets mostly rely on heuristic filtering methods, restricting both their cross-lingual transferability and scalability. Here, we introduce JQL, a systematic approach that efficiently curates diverse and high-quality multilingual data at scale while significantly reducing computational demands. JQL distills LLMs' annotation capabilities into lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings. These models exhibit robust multilingual and cross-lingual performance, even for languages and scripts unseen during training. Evaluated empirically across 35 languages, the resulting annotation pipeline substantially outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2. JQL notably enhances downstream model training quality and increases data retention rates. Our research provides practical insights and valuable resources for multilingual data curation, raising the standards of multilingual dataset development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Yambda-5B, a large-scale open dataset sourced from the Yandex.Music streaming platform. Yambda-5B contains 4.79 billion user-item interactions from 1 million users across 9.39 million tracks. The dataset includes two primary types of interactions: implicit feedback (listening events) and explicit feedback (likes, dislikes, unlikes and undislikes). In addition, we provide audio embeddings for most tracks, generated by a convolutional neural network trained on audio spectrograms. A key distinguishing feature of Yambda-5B is the inclusion of the is_organic flag, which separates organic user actions from recommendation-driven events. This distinction is critical for developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms, as Yandex.Music relies on recommender systems to personalize track selection for users. To support rigorous benchmarking, we introduce an evaluation protocol based on a Global Temporal Split, allowing recommendation algorithms to be assessed in conditions that closely mirror real-world use. We report benchmark results for standard baselines (ItemKNN, iALS) and advanced models (SANSA, SASRec) using a variety of evaluation metrics. By releasing Yambda-5B to the community, we aim to provide a readily accessible, industrial-scale resource to advance research, foster innovation, and promote reproducible results in recommender systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online resource allocation under budget constraints critically depends on proper modeling of user arrival dynamics. Classical approaches employ stochastic user arrival models to derive near-optimal solutions through fractional matching formulations of exposed users for downstream allocation tasks. However, this is no longer a reasonable assumption when the environment changes dynamically. In this work, We propose the Universal Dual optimization framework UDuo, a novel paradigm that fundamentally rethinks online allocation through three key innovations: (i) a temporal user arrival representation vector that explicitly captures distribution shifts in user arrival patterns and resource consumption dynamics, (ii) a resource pacing learner with adaptive allocation policies that generalize to heterogeneous constraint scenarios, and (iii) an online time-series forecasting approach for future user arrival distributions that achieves asymptotically optimal solutions with constraint feasibility guarantees in dynamic environments. Experimental results show that UDuo achieves higher efficiency and faster convergence than the traditional stochastic arrival model in real-world pricing while maintaining rigorous theoretical validity for general online allocation problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel LiDAR-based semantic segmentation framework tailored for autonomous forklifts operating in complex outdoor environments. Central to our approach is the integration of a dual LiDAR system, which combines forward-facing and downward-angled LiDAR sensors to enable comprehensive scene understanding, specifically tailored for industrial material handling tasks. The dual configuration improves the detection and segmentation of dynamic and static obstacles with high spatial precision. Using high-resolution 3D point clouds captured from two sensors, our method employs a lightweight yet robust approach that segments the point clouds into safety-critical instance classes such as pedestrians, vehicles, and forklifts, as well as environmental classes such as driveable ground, lanes, and buildings. Experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves high segmentation accuracy while satisfying strict runtime requirements, establishing its viability for safety-aware, fully autonomous forklift navigation in dynamic warehouse and yard environments.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Unsolvable: When In-Context Search Meets Test-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs), even when trained to generate extended long reasoning steps, still face significant challenges on hard reasoning problems. However, much of the existing literature relies on direct prompting with simple in-context learning examples for evaluation, which largely overlooks advanced techniques to elicit LLMs' deliberate reasoning before drawing conclusions that LLMs hit a performance ceiling. In this paper, we systematically explore the combined potential of in-context search and test-time scaling on super hard reasoning tasks. We find that by employing advanced in-context search prompting to LLMs augmented with internal scaling, one can achieve transformative performance breakthroughs on tasks previously deemed "unsolvable" (e.g., reported success rates below 5%). We provide both empirical results and theoretical analysis of how this combination can unleash LLM reasoning capabilities: i) Empirically, on controlled NP-hard tasks and complex real-world planning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to a 30x improvement in success rates compared to previously reported results without any external mechanisms; ii) Theoretically, we show that in-context search prompting, when combined with internal scaling, significantly extends the complexity class of solvable reasoning problems. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the limitations of LLMs on complex tasks, indicating that current evaluation paradigms systematically underestimate their true potential. Our work calls for a critical reassessment of how LLM reasoning is benchmarked and a more robust evaluation strategy that fully captures the true capabilities of contemporary LLMs, which can lead to a better understanding of their operational reasoning boundaries in real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>If Pigs Could Fly... Can LLMs Logically Reason Through Counterfactuals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in familiar contexts, but struggle when the context conflicts with their parametric knowledge. To investigate this phenomenon, we introduce CounterLogic, a dataset containing 1,800 examples across 9 logical schemas, explicitly designed to evaluate logical reasoning through counterfactual (hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) scenarios. Our systematic evaluation of 11 LLMs across 6 different datasets reveals a consistent performance degradation, with accuracies dropping by 27% on average when reasoning through counterfactual information. We propose Self-Segregate, a prompting method enabling metacognitive awareness (explicitly identifying knowledge conflicts) before reasoning. Our method dramatically narrows the average performance gaps from 27% to just 11%, while significantly increasing the overall accuracy (+7.5%). We discuss the implications of these findings and draw parallels to human cognitive processes, particularly on how humans disambiguate conflicting information during reasoning tasks. Our findings offer practical insights for understanding and enhancing LLMs reasoning capabilities in real-world applications, especially where models must logically reason independently of their factual knowledge.</description>

      <title>Individualised Counterfactual Examples Using Conformal Prediction Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations for black-box models aim to pr ovide insight into an algorithmic decision to its recipient. For a binary classification problem an individual counterfactual details which features might be changed for the model to infer the opposite class. High-dimensional feature spaces that are typical of machine learning classification models admit many possible counterfactual examples to a decision, and so it is important to identify additional criteria to select the most useful counterfactuals. In this paper, we explore the idea that the counterfactuals should be maximally informative when considering the knowledge of a specific individual about the underlying classifier. To quantify this information gain we explicitly model the knowledge of the individual, and assess the uncertainty of predictions which the individual makes by the width of a conformal prediction interval. Regions of feature space where the prediction interval is wide correspond to areas where the confidence in decision making is low, and an additional counterfactual example might be more informative to an individual. To explore and evaluate our individualised conformal prediction interval counterfactuals (CPICFs), first we present a synthetic data set on a hypercube which allows us to fully visualise the decision boundary, conformal intervals via three different methods, and resultant CPICFs. Second, in this synthetic data set we explore the impact of a single CPICF on the knowledge of an individual locally around the original query. Finally, in both our synthetic data set and a complex real world dataset with a combination of continuous and discrete variables, we measure the utility of these counterfactuals via data augmentation, testing the performance on a held out set.</description>

      <title>Credal Prediction based on Relative Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictions in the form of sets of probability distributions, so-called credal sets, provide a suitable means to represent a learner's epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to credal prediction based on the statistical notion of relative likelihood: The target of prediction is the set of all (conditional) probability distributions produced by the collection of plausible models, namely those models whose relative likelihood exceeds a specified threshold. This threshold has an intuitive interpretation and allows for controlling the trade-off between correctness and precision of credal predictions. We tackle the problem of approximating credal sets defined in this way by means of suitably modified ensemble learning techniques. To validate our approach, we illustrate its effectiveness by experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrating superior uncertainty representation without compromising predictive performance. We also compare our method against several state-of-the-art baselines in credal prediction.</description>

      <title>Advancing Multimodal Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a crucial role in this progress. While "aha moment" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$73.4 % on MathVista, 62.9 %$\rightarrow$70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/RL-with-Cold-Start.</description>

      <title>Progressive Data Dropout: An Embarrassingly Simple Approach to Faster Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of the machine learning field has reliably depended on training on large datasets. While effective, this trend comes at an extraordinary cost. This is due to two deeply intertwined factors: the size of models and the size of datasets. While promising research efforts focus on reducing the size of models, the other half of the equation remains fairly mysterious. Indeed, it is surprising that the standard approach to training remains to iterate over and over, uniformly sampling the training dataset. In this paper we explore a series of alternative training paradigms that leverage insights from hard-data-mining and dropout, simple enough to implement and use that can become the new training standard. The proposed Progressive Data Dropout reduces the number of effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of the baseline. This savings actually do not come at any cost for accuracy. Surprisingly, the proposed method improves accuracy by up to 4.82%. Our approach requires no changes to model architecture or optimizer, and can be applied across standard training pipelines, thus posing an excellent opportunity for wide adoption.

      <title>Computing Optimal Transport Maps and Wasserstein Barycenters Using Conditional Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for efficiently computing optimal transport maps and Wasserstein barycenters in high-dimensional spaces. Our approach uses conditional normalizing flows to approximate the input distributions as invertible pushforward transformations from a common latent space. This makes it possible to directly solve the primal problem using gradient-based minimization of the transport cost, unlike previous methods that rely on dual formulations and complex adversarial optimization. We show how this approach can be extended to compute Wasserstein barycenters by solving a conditional variance minimization problem. A key advantage of our conditional architecture is that it enables the computation of barycenters for hundreds of input distributions, which was computationally infeasible with previous methods. Our numerical experiments illustrate that our approach yields accurate results across various high-dimensional tasks and compares favorably with previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>DAM: Domain-Aware Module for Multi-Domain Dataset Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset Condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate the computational and storage burdens associated with training deep learning models. However, existing DC methods largely overlook the multi-domain nature of modern datasets, which are increasingly composed of heterogeneous images spanning multiple domains. In this paper, we extend DC and introduce Multi-Domain Dataset Condensation (MDDC), which aims to condense data that generalizes across both single-domain and multi-domain settings. To this end, we propose the Domain-Aware Module (DAM), a training-time module that embeds domain-related features into each synthetic image via learnable spatial masks. As explicit domain labels are mostly unavailable in real-world datasets, we employ frequency-based pseudo-domain labeling, which leverages low-frequency amplitude statistics. DAM is only active during the condensation process, thus preserving the same images per class (IPC) with prior methods. Experiments show that DAM consistently improves in-domain, out-of-domain, and cross-architecture performance over baseline dataset condensation methods.</description>

      <title>Synonymous Variational Inference for Perceptual Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent contributions of semantic information theory reveal the set-element relationship between semantic and syntactic information, represented as synonymous relationships. In this paper, we propose a synonymous variational inference (SVI) method based on this synonymity viewpoint to re-analyze the perceptual image compression problem. It takes perceptual similarity as a typical synonymous criterion to build an ideal synonymous set (Synset), and approximate the posterior of its latent synonymous representation with a parametric density by minimizing a partial semantic KL divergence. This analysis theoretically proves that the optimization direction of perception image compression follows a triple tradeoff that can cover the existing rate-distortion-perception schemes. Additionally, we introduce synonymous image compression (SIC), a new image compression scheme that corresponds to the analytical process of SVI, and implement a progressive SIC codec to fully leverage the model's capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate comparable rate-distortion-perception performance using a single progressive SIC codec, thus verifying the effectiveness of our proposed analysis method.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Post-Training for Multi-Modal LLM Reasoning via GRPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). However, these supervised methods require expensive and manually annotated multi-modal data--an ultimately unsustainable resource. While recent efforts have explored unsupervised post-training, their methods are complex and difficult to iterate. In this work, we are the first to investigate the use of GRPO, a stable and scalable online RL algorithm, for enabling continual self-improvement without any external supervision. We propose MM-UPT, a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs. MM-UPT builds upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments demonstrate that MM-UPT significantly improves the reasoning ability of Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$72.9 % on MathVista, 62.9 %$\rightarrow$68.7 % on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth labels. MM-UPT also outperforms prior unsupervised baselines and even approaches the results of supervised GRPO. Furthermore, we show that incorporating synthetic questions, generated solely by MLLM itself, can boost performance as well, highlighting a promising approach for scalable self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for continual, autonomous enhancement of MLLMs in the absence of external supervision. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/MM-UPT.</description>

      <title>Depth-Based Matrix Classification for the HHL Quantum Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under the nearing error-corrected era of quantum computing, it is necessary to understand the suitability of certain post-NISQ algorithms for practical problems. One of the most promising, applicable and yet difficult to implement in practical terms is the Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for linear systems of equations. An enormous number of problems can be expressed as linear systems of equations, from Machine Learning to fluid dynamics. However, in most cases, HHL will not be able to provide a practical, reasonable solution to these problems. This paper's goal inquires about whether problems can be labeled using Machine Learning classifiers as suitable or unsuitable for HHL implementation when some numerical information about the problem is known beforehand. This work demonstrates that training on significantly representative data distributions is critical to achieve good classifications of the problems based on the numerical properties of the matrix representing the system of equations. Accurate classification is possible through Multi-Layer Perceptrons, although with careful design of the training data distribution and classifier parameters.</description>

      <title>Topological Structure Learning Should Be A Research Priority for LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex tasks through collaborative intelligence. Nevertheless, the question of how agents should be structurally organized for optimal cooperation remains largely unexplored. In this position paper, we aim to gently redirect the focus of the MAS research community toward this critical dimension: develop topology-aware MASs for specific tasks. Specifically, the system consists of three core components - agents, communication links, and communication patterns - that collectively shape its coordination performance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a systematic, three-stage framework: agent selection, structure profiling, and topology synthesis. Each stage would trigger new research opportunities in areas such as language models, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and generative modeling; together, they could unleash the full potential of MASs in complicated real-world applications. Then, we discuss the potential challenges and opportunities in the evaluation of multiple systems. We hope our perspective and framework can offer critical new insights in the era of agentic AI.</description>

      <title>CPINN-ABPI: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Accurate Power Estimation in MPSoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient thermal and power management in modern multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) demands accurate power consumption estimation. One of the state-of-the-art approaches, Alternative Blind Power Identification (ABPI), theoretically eliminates the dependence on steady-state temperatures, addressing a major shortcoming of previous approaches. However, ABPI performance has remained unverified in actual hardware implementations. In this study, we conduct the first empirical validation of ABPI on commercial hardware using the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX platform. Our findings reveal that, while ABPI provides computational efficiency and independence from steady-state temperature, it exhibits considerable accuracy deficiencies in real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that integrates Custom Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CPINNs) with the underlying thermal model of ABPI. Our approach employs a specialized loss function that harmonizes physical principles with data-driven learning, complemented by multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization to balance estimation accuracy and computational cost. In experimental validation, CPINN-ABPI achieves a reduction of 84.7\% CPU and 73.9\% GPU in the mean absolute error (MAE) relative to ABPI, with the weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE) improving from 47\%--81\% to $\sim$12\%. The method maintains real-time performance with 195.3~$\mu$s of inference time, with similar 85\%--99\% accuracy gains across heterogeneous SoCs.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis Testing in Imaging Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for semantic hypothesis testing tailored to imaging inverse problems. Modern imaging methods struggle to support hypothesis testing, a core component of the scientific method that is essential for the rigorous interpretation of experiments and robust interfacing with decision-making processes. There are three main reasons why image-based hypothesis testing is challenging. First, the difficulty of using a single observation to simultaneously reconstruct an image, formulate hypotheses, and quantify their statistical significance. Second, the hypotheses encountered in imaging are mostly of semantic nature, rather than quantitative statements about pixel values. Third, it is challenging to control test error probabilities because the null and alternative distributions are often unknown. Our proposed approach addresses these difficulties by leveraging concepts from self-supervised computational imaging, vision-language models, and non-parametric hypothesis testing with e-values. We demonstrate our proposed framework through numerical experiments related to image-based phenotyping, where we achieve excellent power while robustly controlling Type I errors.</description>

      <title>Assessing Quantum Advantage for Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression is a well-known machine learning technique for which several quantum algorithms have been proposed. We show here that in a wide range of scenarios these algorithms show no exponential speedup. We achieve this by rigorously proving that the condition number of a kernel matrix scales at least linearly with the matrix size under general assumptions on the data and kernel. We additionally prove that the sparsity and Frobenius norm of a kernel matrix scale linearly under similar assumptions. The implications for the quantum algorithms runtime are independent of the complexity of loading classical data on a quantum computer and also apply to dequantised algorithms. We supplement our theoretical analysis with numerical verification for popular kernels in machine learning.</description>

      <title>IGNIS: A Neural Network Framework for Robust Parameter Estimation in Archimedean Copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation for Archimedean copulas remains a challenging problem, particularly for the recently developed A1 and A2 families that exhibit complex dependency structures. Traditional methods, such as the Method of Moments (MoM), Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood (MPL), often struggle due to issues of non-monotonic relationship with dependency measures such as Kendall's tau (as in the case of A1) and numerical instability. In this paper, we present the IGNIS Network, a novel, unified neural framework that learns a direct mapping from observable dependency measures to copula parameters, thereby overcoming the limitations of classical approaches. Our approach is trained on simulated data spanning five Archimedean copula families including Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, A1, and A2, ensuring its general applicability across the entire family. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the IGNIS Network reduces estimation errors compared to MoM, while inherently enforcing parameter constraints through theory-guided post-processing. We further validate the practical utility of our method on diverse real-world datasets, including financial returns (AAPL-MSFT), healthcare metrics (CDC Diabetes indicators), and environmental measurements (PM2.5 air quality). Our results underscore the transformative potential of neural methods for robust and accurate dependence modeling in modern applications.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Generative Networks (SGNs): A Hamiltonian Framework for Invertible Deep Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Symplectic Generative Network (SGN), a deep generative model that leverages Hamiltonian mechanics to construct an invertible, volume-preserving mapping between a latent space and the data space. By endowing the latent space with a symplectic structure and modeling data generation as the time evolution of a Hamiltonian system, SGN achieves exact likelihood evaluation without incurring the computational overhead of Jacobian determinant calculations. In this work, we provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for SGNs through a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes: (i) complete proofs of invertibility and volume preservation, (ii) a formal complexity analysis with theoretical comparisons to Variational Autoencoders and Normalizing Flows, (iii) strengthened universal approximation results with quantitative error bounds, (iv) an information-theoretic analysis based on the geometry of statistical manifolds, and (v) an extensive stability analysis with adaptive integration guarantees. These contributions highlight the fundamental advantages of SGNs and establish a solid foundation for future empirical investigations and applications to complex, high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>RiverMamba: A State Space Model for Global River Discharge and Flood Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches for river discharge forecasting have improved the accuracy and efficiency in flood forecasting, enabling more reliable early warning systems for risk management. Nevertheless, existing deep learning approaches in hydrology remain largely confined to local-scale applications and do not leverage the inherent spatial connections of bodies of water. Thus, there is a strong need for new deep learning methodologies that are capable of modeling spatio-temporal relations to improve river discharge and flood forecasting for scientific and operational applications. To address this, we present RiverMamba, a novel deep learning model that is pretrained with long-term reanalysis data and that can forecast global river discharge and floods on a $0.05^\circ$ grid up to 7 days lead time, which is of high relevance in early warning. To achieve this, RiverMamba leverages efficient Mamba blocks that enable the model to capture global-scale channel network routing and enhance its forecast capability for longer lead times. The forecast blocks integrate ECMWF HRES meteorological forecasts, while accounting for their inaccuracies through spatio-temporal modeling. Our analysis demonstrates that RiverMamba delivers reliable predictions of river discharge, including extreme floods across return periods and lead times, surpassing both operational AI- and physics-based models.</description>

      <title>Can Copulas Be Used for Feature Selection? A Machine Learning Study on Diabetes Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate diabetes risk prediction relies on identifying key features from complex health datasets, but conventional methods like mutual information (MI) filters and genetic algorithms (GAs) often overlook extreme dependencies critical for high-risk subpopulations. In this study we introduce a feature-selection framework using the upper-tail dependence coefficient ({\lambda}U) of the novel A2 copula, which quantifies how often extreme higher values of a predictor co-occur with diabetes diagnoses (target variable). Applied to the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset (n=253,680), our method prioritizes five predictors (self-reported general health, high blood pressure, body mass index, mobility limitations, and high cholesterol levels) based on upper tail dependencies. These features match or outperform MI and GA selected subsets across four classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting), achieving accuracy up to 86.5% (XGBoost) and AUC up to 0.806 (Gradient Boosting), rivaling the full 21-feature model. Permutation importance confirms clinical relevance, with BMI and general health driving accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply a copula's upper-tail dependence for supervised feature selection, bridging extreme-value theory and machine learning to deliver a practical toolkit for diabetes prevention.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Video Dataset Condensation with Progressive Refinement and Insertion for Sparse Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video dataset condensation has emerged as a critical technique for addressing the computational challenges associated with large-scale video data processing in deep learning applications. While significant progress has been made in image dataset condensation, the video domain presents unique challenges due to the complex interplay between spatial content and temporal dynamics. This paper introduces PRISM, Progressive Refinement and Insertion for Sparse Motion, for video dataset condensation, a novel approach that fundamentally reconsiders how video data should be condensed. Unlike the previous method that separates static content from dynamic motion, our method preserves the essential interdependence between these elements. Our approach progressively refines and inserts frames to fully accommodate the motion in an action while achieving better performance but less storage, considering the relation of gradients for each frame. Extensive experiments across standard video action recognition benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM outperforms existing disentangled approaches while maintaining compact representations suitable for resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Self-Error-Instruct: Generalizing from Errors for LLMs Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although large language models demonstrate strong performance across various domains, they still struggle with numerous bad cases in mathematical reasoning. Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on the instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new data is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the most effective examples are kept. Finally, we use these curated data to fine-tune the target model, iteratively repeating the process to enhance performance. We apply our framework to various models and observe improvements in their reasoning abilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematics datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-error instruction in improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning through error generalization.</description>

      <title>HDDLGym: A Tool for Studying Multi-Agent Hierarchical Problems Defined in HDDL with OpenAI Gym</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been widely tested using tools like OpenAI Gym, though many tasks in these environments could also benefit from hierarchical planning. However, there is a lack of a tool that enables seamless integration of hierarchical planning with RL. Hierarchical Domain Definition Language (HDDL), used in classical planning, introduces a structured approach well-suited for model-based RL to address this gap. To bridge this integration, we introduce HDDLGym, a Python-based tool that automatically generates OpenAI Gym environments from HDDL domains and problems. HDDLGym serves as a link between RL and hierarchical planning, supporting multi-agent scenarios and enabling collaborative planning among agents. This paper provides an overview of HDDLGym's design and implementation, highlighting the challenges and design choices involved in integrating HDDL with the Gym interface, and applying RL policies to support hierarchical planning. We also provide detailed instructions and demonstrations for using the HDDLGym framework, including how to work with existing HDDL domains and problems from International Planning Competitions, exemplified by the Transport domain. Additionally, we offer guidance on creating new HDDL domains for multi-agent scenarios and demonstrate the practical use of HDDLGym in the Overcooked domain. By leveraging the advantages of HDDL and Gym, HDDLGym aims to be a valuable tool for studying RL in hierarchical planning, particularly in multi-agent contexts.</description>

      <title>On the performance of machine-learning assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance across multiple classification models to classify chest X-ray images into four categories of COVID-19, pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and normal cases. We leveraged transfer learning techniques with state-of-the-art pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models. We fine-tuned these pre-trained architectures on a labeled medical x-ray images. The initial results are promising with high accuracy and strong performance in key classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. We applied Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for model interpretability to provide visual explanations for classification decisions, improving trust and transparency in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Principled Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Simplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern foundation models exhibit remarkable out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, solving tasks far beyond the support of their training data. However, the theoretical principles underpinning this phenomenon remain elusive. This paper investigates this problem by examining the compositional generalization abilities of diffusion models in image generation. Our analysis reveals that while neural network architectures are expressive enough to represent a wide range of models -- including many with undesirable behavior on OOD inputs -- the true, generalizable model that aligns with human expectations typically corresponds to the simplest among those consistent with the training data.
  Motivated by this observation, we develop a theoretical framework for OOD generalization via simplicity, quantified using a predefined simplicity metric. We analyze two key regimes: (1) the constant-gap setting, where the true model is strictly simpler than all spurious alternatives by a fixed gap, and (2) the vanishing-gap setting, where the fixed gap is replaced by a smoothness condition ensuring that models close in simplicity to the true model yield similar predictions. For both regimes, we study the regularized maximum likelihood estimator and establish the first sharp sample complexity guarantees for learning the true, generalizable, simple model.</description>

      <title>SCIZOR: A Self-Supervised Approach to Data Curation for Large-Scale Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning advances robot capabilities by enabling the acquisition of diverse behaviors from human demonstrations. However, large-scale datasets used for policy training often introduce substantial variability in quality, which can negatively impact performance. As a result, automatically curating datasets by filtering low-quality samples to improve quality becomes essential. Existing robotic curation approaches rely on costly manual annotations and perform curation at a coarse granularity, such as the dataset or trajectory level, failing to account for the quality of individual state-action pairs. To address this, we introduce SCIZOR, a self-supervised data curation framework that filters out low-quality state-action pairs to improve the performance of imitation learning policies. SCIZOR targets two complementary sources of low-quality data: suboptimal data, which hinders learning with undesirable actions, and redundant data, which dilutes training with repetitive patterns. SCIZOR leverages a self-supervised task progress predictor for suboptimal data to remove samples lacking task progression, and a deduplication module operating on joint state-action representation for samples with redundant patterns. Empirically, we show that SCIZOR enables imitation learning policies to achieve higher performance with less data, yielding an average improvement of 15.4% across multiple benchmarks.

      <description>arXiv:2505.22633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities; however, their spatial perception abilities remain a notable limitation. To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. In this work, we introduce SKG2Data, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2Data automatically constructs a Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) to emulate human-like perception of spatial directions and distances, which is subsequently utilized to guide multimodal data synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, not only enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs but also exhibit strong generalization capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>SimProcess: High Fidelity Simulation of Noisy ICS Physical Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) manage critical infrastructures like power grids and water treatment plants. Cyberattacks on ICSs can disrupt operations, causing severe economic, environmental, and safety issues. For example, undetected pollution in a water plant can put the lives of thousands at stake. ICS researchers have increasingly turned to honeypots -- decoy systems designed to attract attackers, study their behaviors, and eventually improve defensive mechanisms. However, existing ICS honeypots struggle to replicate the ICS physical process, making them susceptible to detection. Accurately simulating the noise in ICS physical processes is challenging because different factors produce it, including sensor imperfections and external interferences.
  In this paper, we propose SimProcess, a novel framework to rank the fidelity of ICS simulations by evaluating how closely they resemble real-world and noisy physical processes. It measures the simulation distance from a target system by estimating the noise distribution with machine learning models like Random Forest. Unlike existing solutions that require detailed mathematical models or are limited to simple systems, SimProcess operates with only a timeseries of measurements from the real system, making it applicable to a broader range of complex dynamic systems. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study using real-world power grid data from the EPIC testbed. We compare the performance of various simulation methods, including static and generative noise techniques. Our model correctly classifies real samples with a recall of up to 1.0. It also identifies Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture as the best distribution to simulate our power systems, together with a generative solution provided by an autoencoder, thereby helping developers to improve honeypot fidelity. Additionally, we make our code publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven significant progress in robotics, but its complexity and long training times remain major bottlenecks. In this report, we introduce FastTD3, a simple, fast, and capable RL algorithm that significantly speeds up training for humanoid robots in popular suites such as HumanoidBench, IsaacLab, and MuJoCo Playground. Our recipe is remarkably simple: we train an off-policy TD3 agent with several modifications -- parallel simulation, large-batch updates, a distributional critic, and carefully tuned hyperparameters. FastTD3 solves a range of HumanoidBench tasks in under 3 hours on a single A100 GPU, while remaining stable during training. We also provide a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of FastTD3 to accelerate RL research in robotics.</description>

      <title>Pre-training for Recommendation Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Modern recommender systems powered by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling complex user-item interactions, yet increasingly face scenarios requiring selective forgetting of training data. Beyond user requests to remove specific interactions due to privacy concerns or preference changes, regulatory frameworks mandate recommender systems' ability to eliminate the influence of certain user data from models. This recommendation unlearning challenge presents unique difficulties as removing connections within interaction graphs creates ripple effects throughout the model, potentially impacting recommendations for numerous users. Traditional approaches suffer from significant drawbacks: fragmentation methods damage graph structure and diminish performance, while influence function techniques make assumptions that may not hold in complex GNNs, particularly with self-supervised or random architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic pre-training paradigm UnlearnRec that prepares systems for efficient unlearning operations. Our Influence Encoder takes unlearning requests together with existing model parameters and directly produces updated parameters of unlearned model with little fine-tuning, avoiding complete retraining while preserving model performance characteristics. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks demonstrates that our method delivers exceptional unlearning effectiveness while providing more than 10x speedup compared to retraining approaches. We release our method implementation at: https://github.com/HKUDS/UnlearnRec.</description>

      <title>Sherlock: Self-Correcting Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising performance on complex multimodal tasks. However, they still face significant challenges: they are highly sensitive to reasoning errors, require large volumes of annotated data or accurate verifiers, and struggle to generalize beyond specific domains. To address these limitations, we explore self-correction as a strategy to enhance reasoning VLMs. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of reasoning VLMs' self-correction abilities and identify key gaps. Based on our findings, we introduce Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement training framework. Sherlock introduces a trajectory-level self-correction objective, a preference data construction method based on visual perturbation, and a dynamic $\beta$ for preference tuning. Once the model acquires self-correction capabilities using only 20k randomly sampled annotated data, it continues to self-improve without external supervision. Built on the Llama3.2-Vision-11B model, Sherlock achieves remarkable results across eight benchmarks, reaching an average accuracy of 64.1 with direct generation and 65.4 after self-correction. It outperforms LLaVA-CoT (63.2), Mulberry (63.9), and LlamaV-o1 (63.4) while using less than 20% of the annotated data.</description>

      <title>3DLLM-Mem: Long-Term Spatial-Temporal Memory for Embodied 3D Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans excel at performing complex tasks by leveraging long-term memory across temporal and spatial experiences. In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.</description>

      <title>AutoL2S: Auto Long-Short Reasoning for Efficient Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex reasoning tasks but often suffer from overthinking, generating unnecessarily long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths for easy reasoning questions, thereby increasing inference cost and latency. Recent approaches attempt to address this challenge by manually deciding when to apply long or short reasoning. However, they lack the flexibility to adapt CoT length dynamically based on question complexity. In this paper, we propose Auto Long-Short Reasoning (AutoL2S), a dynamic and model-agnostic framework that enables LLMs to dynamically compress their generated reasoning path based on the complexity of the reasoning question. AutoL2S enables a learned paradigm, in which LLMs themselves can decide when longer reasoning is necessary and when shorter reasoning suffices, by training on data annotated with our proposed method, which includes both long and short CoT paths and a special &lt;EASY&gt; token. We then use &lt;EASY&gt; token to indicate when the model can skip generating lengthy CoT reasoning. This proposed annotation strategy can enhance the LLMs' ability to generate shorter CoT reasoning paths with improved quality after training. Extensive evaluation results show that AutoL2S reduces the length of reasoning generation by up to 57% without compromising performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoL2S for scalable and efficient LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>Inferring Traffic Models in Terminal Airspace from Flight Tracks and Procedures</title>

Abstract: Realistic aircraft trajectory models are useful in the design and validation of air traffic management (ATM) systems. Models of aircraft operated under instrument flight rules (IFR) require capturing the variability inherent in how aircraft follow standard flight procedures. The variability in aircraft behavior differs among flight stages. In this paper, we propose a simple probabilistic model that can learn this variability from procedural data and flight tracks collected from radar surveillance data. For each segment, we use a Gaussian mixture model to learn the deviations of aircraft trajectories from their procedures. Given new procedures, we generate synthetic trajectories by sampling a series of deviations from the Gaussian mixture model and reconstructing the aircraft trajectory using the deviations and the procedures. We extend this method to capture pairwise correlations between aircraft and show how a pairwise model can be used to generate traffic involving an arbitrary number of aircraft. We demonstrate the proposed models on the arrival tracks and procedures of the John F. Kennedy International Airport. Distributional similarity between the original and the synthetic trajectory dataset was evaluated using the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the empirical distributions of different variables and we provide qualitative analyses of the synthetic trajectories generated.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Evaluation of Rewiring Approaches in Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks compute node representations by performing multiple message-passing steps that consist in local aggregations of node features. Having deep models that can leverage longer-range interactions between nodes is hindered by the issues of over-smoothing and over-squashing. In particular, the latter is attributed to the graph topology which guides the message-passing, causing a node representation to become insensitive to information contained at distant nodes. Many graph rewiring methods have been proposed to remedy or mitigate this problem. However, properly evaluating the benefits of these methods is made difficult by the coupling of over-squashing with other issues strictly related to model training, such as vanishing gradients. Therefore, we propose an evaluation setting based on message-passing models that do not require training to compute node and graph representations. We perform a systematic experimental comparison on real-world node and graph classification tasks, showing that rewiring the underlying graph rarely does confer a practical benefit for message-passing.</description>

      <title>Variational Positive-incentive Noise: How Noise Benefits Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large number of works aim to alleviate the impact of noise due to an underlying conventional assumption of the negative role of noise. However, some existing works show that the assumption does not always hold. In this paper, we investigate how to benefit the classical models by random noise under the framework of Positive-incentive Noise (Pi-Noise). Since the ideal objective of Pi-Noise is intractable, we propose to optimize its variational bound instead, namely variational Pi-Noise (VPN). With the variational inference, a VPN generator implemented by neural networks is designed for enhancing base models and simplifying the inference of base models, without changing the architecture of base models. Benefiting from the independent design of base models and VPN generators, the VPN generator can work with most existing models. From the experiments, it is shown that the proposed VPN generator can improve the base models. It is appealing that the trained variational VPN generator prefers to blur the irrelevant ingredients in complicated images, which meets our expectations.</description>

      <title>Watermarks in the Sand: Impossibility of Strong Watermarking for Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04378v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Watermarking generative models consists of planting a statistical signal (watermark) in a model's output so that it can be later verified that the output was generated by the given model. A strong watermarking scheme satisfies the property that a computationally bounded attacker cannot erase the watermark without causing significant quality degradation. In this paper, we study the (im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, under well-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to achieve. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the watermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the attacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark attack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or even which scheme is used. Our attack is based on two assumptions: (1) The attacker has access to a "quality oracle" that can evaluate whether a candidate output is a high-quality response to a prompt, and (2) The attacker has access to a "perturbation oracle" which can modify an output with a nontrivial probability of maintaining quality, and which induces an efficiently mixing random walk on high-quality outputs. We argue that both assumptions can be satisfied in practice by an attacker with weaker computational capabilities than the watermarked model itself, to which the attacker has only black-box access. Furthermore, our assumptions will likely only be easier to satisfy over time as models grow in capabilities and modalities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our attack by instantiating it to attack three existing watermarking schemes for large language models: Kirchenbauer et al. (2023), Kuditipudi et al. (2023), and Zhao et al. (2023). The same attack successfully removes the watermarks planted by all three schemes, with only minor quality degradation.</description>

      <title>Beyond RMSE and MAE: Introducing EAUC to unmask hidden bias and unfairness in dyadic regression models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10690v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dyadic regression models, which output real-valued predictions for pairs of entities, are fundamental in many domains (e.g. obtaining user-product ratings in Recommender Systems) and promising and under exploration in others (e.g. tuning patient-drug dosages in precision pharmacology). In this work, we prove that non-uniform observed value distributions of individual entities lead to severe biases in state-of-the-art models, skewing predictions towards the average of observed past values for the entity and providing worse-than-random predictive power in eccentric yet crucial cases; we name this phenomenon eccentricity bias. We show that global error metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are insufficient to capture this bias, and we introduce Eccentricity-Area Under the Curve (EAUC) as a novel metric that can quantify it in all studied domains and models. We prove the intuitive interpretation of EAUC by experimenting with naive post-training bias corrections, and theorize other options to use EAUC to guide the construction of fair models. This work contributes a bias-aware evaluation of dyadic regression to prevent unfairness in critical real-world applications of such systems.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic User-Centric Interpretability through Global Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02933v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In human-centric settings like education or healthcare, model accuracy and model explainability are key factors for user adoption. Towards these two goals, intrinsically interpretable deep learning models have gained popularity, focusing on accurate predictions alongside faithful explanations. However, there exists a gap in the human-centeredness of these approaches, which often produce nuanced and complex explanations that are not easily actionable for downstream users. We present InterpretCC (interpretable conditional computation), a family of intrinsically interpretable neural networks at a unique point in the design space that optimizes for ease of human understanding and explanation faithfulness, while maintaining comparable performance to state-of-the-art models. InterpretCC achieves this through adaptive sparse activation of features before prediction, allowing the model to use a different, minimal set of features for each instance. We extend this idea into an interpretable, global mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that allows users to specify topics of interest, discretely separates the feature space for each data point into topical subnetworks, and adaptively and sparsely activates these topical subnetworks for prediction. We apply InterpretCC for text, time series and tabular data across several real-world datasets, demonstrating comparable performance with non-interpretable baselines and outperforming intrinsically interpretable baselines. Through a user study involving 56 teachers, InterpretCC explanations are found to have higher actionability and usefulness over other intrinsically interpretable approaches.</description>

Abstract: We address the challenge of federated learning on graph-structured data distributed across multiple clients. Specifically, we focus on the prevalent scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between different clients play a critical role. We present a novel framework for this scenario, named FedStruct, that harnesses deep structural dependencies. To uphold privacy, unlike existing methods, FedStruct eliminates the necessity of sharing or generating sensitive node features or embeddings among clients. Instead, it leverages explicit global graph structure information to capture inter-node dependencies. We validate the effectiveness of FedStruct through experimental results conducted on six datasets for semi-supervised node classification, showcasing performance close to the centralized approach across various scenarios, including different data partitioning methods, varying levels of label availability, and number of clients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the \emph{linear contextual bandit problem} with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) contexts. In this problem, we aim to develop a \emph{Best-of-Both-Worlds} (BoBW) algorithm with regret upper bounds in both stochastic and adversarial regimes. We develop an algorithm based on \emph{Follow-The-Regularized-Leader} (FTRL) with Tsallis entropy, referred to as the $\alpha$-\emph{Linear-Contextual (LC)-Tsallis-INF}. We show that its regret is at most $O(\log(T))$ in the stochastic regime under the assumption that the suboptimality gap is uniformly bounded from below, and at most $O(\sqrt{T})$ in the adversarial regime. Furthermore, our regret analysis is extended to more general regimes characterized by the \emph{margin condition} with a parameter $\beta \in (1, \infty]$, which imposes a milder assumption on the suboptimality gap. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves $O\left(\log(T)^{\frac{1+\beta}{2+\beta}}T^{\frac{1}{2+\beta}}\right)$ regret under the margin condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex and unknown processes, global models are initially generated over the entire experimental space but often fail to provide accurate predictions in local areas. A common approach is to use local models, which requires partitioning the experimental space and training multiple models, adding significant complexity. Recognizing this limitation, this study addresses the need for models that effectively represent both global and local experimental spaces. It introduces a novel machine learning (ML) approach: Polynomial Chaos Expanded Gaussian Process (PCEGP), leveraging polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to calculate input-dependent hyperparameters of the Gaussian process (GP). This provides a mathematically interpretable approach that incorporates non-stationary covariance functions and heteroscedastic noise estimation to generate locally adapted models. The model performance is compared to different algorithms in benchmark tests for regression tasks. The results demonstrate low prediction errors of the PCEGP, highlighting model performance that is often competitive with or better than previous methods. A key advantage of the presented model is its interpretable hyperparameters along with training and prediction runtimes comparable to those of a GP.</description>

      <title>Fast meta-solvers for 3D complex-shape scatterers using neural operators trained on a non-scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional target identification using scattering techniques requires high accuracy solutions and very fast computations for real-time predictions in some critical applications. We first train a deep neural operator~(DeepONet) to solve wave propagation problems described by the Helmholtz equation in a domain \textit{without scatterers} but at different wavenumbers and with a complex absorbing boundary condition. We then design two classes of fast meta-solvers by combining DeepONet with either relaxation methods, such as Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel, or with Krylov methods, such as GMRES and BiCGStab, using the trunk basis of DeepONet as a coarse-scale preconditioner. We leverage the spectral bias of neural networks to account for the lower part of the spectrum in the error distribution while the upper part is handled inexpensively using relaxation methods or fine-scale preconditioners. The meta-solvers are then applied to solve scattering problems with different shape of scatterers, at no extra training cost. We first demonstrate that the resulting meta-solvers are shape-agnostic, fast, and robust, whereas the standard standalone solvers may even fail to converge without the DeepONet. We then apply both classes of meta-solvers to scattering from a submarine, a complex three-dimensional problem. We achieve very fast solutions, especially with the DeepONet-Krylov methods, which require orders of magnitude fewer iterations than any of the standalone solvers.</description>

      <title>Learning Latent Graph Structures and their Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks use relational information as an inductive bias to enhance prediction performance. Not rarely, task-relevant relations are unknown and graph structure learning approaches have been proposed to learn them from data. Given their latent nature, no graph observations are available to provide a direct training signal to the learnable relations. Therefore, graph topologies are typically learned on the prediction task alongside the other graph neural network parameters. In this paper, we demonstrate that minimizing point-prediction losses does not guarantee proper learning of the latent relational information and its associated uncertainty. Conversely, we prove that suitable loss functions on the stochastic model outputs simultaneously grant solving two tasks: (i) learning the unknown distribution of the latent graph and (ii) achieving optimal predictions of the target variable. Finally, we propose a sampling-based method that solves this joint learning task. Empirical results validate our theoretical claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>CTBENCH: A Library and Benchmark for Certified Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training certifiably robust neural networks is an important but challenging task. While many algorithms for (deterministic) certified training have been proposed, they are often evaluated on different training schedules, certification methods, and systematically under-tuned hyperparameters, making it difficult to compare their performance. To address this challenge, we introduce CTBench, a unified library and a high-quality benchmark for certified training that evaluates all algorithms under fair settings and systematically tuned hyperparameters. We show that (1) almost all algorithms in CTBench surpass the corresponding reported performance in literature in the magnitude of algorithmic improvements, thus establishing new state-of-the-art, and (2) the claimed advantage of recent algorithms drops significantly when we enhance the outdated baselines with a fair training schedule, a fair certification method and well-tuned hyperparameters. Based on CTBench, we provide new insights into the current state of certified training, including (1) certified models have less fragmented loss surface, (2) certified models share many mistakes, (3) certified models have more sparse activations, (4) reducing regularization cleverly is crucial for certified training especially for large radii and (5) certified training has the potential to improve out-of-distribution generalization. We are confident that CTBench will serve as a benchmark and testbed for future research in certified training.</description>

      <title>Fully Heteroscedastic Count Regression with Deep Double Poisson Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks capable of accurate, input-conditional uncertainty representation are essential for real-world AI systems. Deep ensembles of Gaussian networks have proven highly effective for continuous regression due to their ability to flexibly represent aleatoric uncertainty via unrestricted heteroscedastic variance, which in turn enables accurate epistemic uncertainty estimation. However, no analogous approach exists for count regression, despite many important applications. To address this gap, we propose the Deep Double Poisson Network (DDPN), a novel neural discrete count regression model that outputs the parameters of the Double Poisson distribution, enabling arbitrarily high or low predictive aleatoric uncertainty for count data and improving epistemic uncertainty estimation when ensembled. We formalize and prove that DDPN exhibits robust regression properties similar to heteroscedastic Gaussian models via learnable loss attenuation, and introduce a simple loss modification to control this behavior. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that DDPN outperforms current baselines in accuracy, calibration, and out-of-distribution detection, establishing a new state-of-the-art in deep count regression.</description>

      <title>Gradient Boosting Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Gradient Boosting Reinforcement Learning (GBRL), a framework that adapts the strengths of gradient boosting trees (GBT) to reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. While neural networks (NNs) have become the de facto choice for RL, they face significant challenges with structured and categorical features and tend to generalize poorly to out-of-distribution samples. These are challenges for which GBTs have traditionally excelled in supervised learning. However, GBT's application in RL has been limited. The design of traditional GBT libraries is optimized for static datasets with fixed labels, making them incompatible with RL's dynamic nature, where both state distributions and reward signals evolve during training. GBRL overcomes this limitation by continuously interleaving tree construction with environment interaction. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that GBRL outperforms NNs in domains with structured observations and categorical features while maintaining competitive performance on standard continuous control benchmarks. Like its supervised learning counterpart, GBRL demonstrates superior robustness to out-of-distribution samples and better handles irregular state-action relationships.</description>

      <title>Mini-batch Coresets for Memory-efficient Language Model Training on Data Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19580v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training with larger mini-batches improves the convergence rate and can yield superior performance. However, training with large mini-batches becomes prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs), due to the large GPU memory requirement. To address this problem, an effective approach is finding small mini-batch coresets that closely match the gradient of larger mini-batches. However, this approach becomes infeasible and ineffective for LLMs, due to the highly imbalanced mixture of sources in language data, use of the Adam optimizer, and the very large gradient dimensionality of LLMs. In this work, we address the above challenges by proposing Coresets for Training LLMs (CoLM). First, we show that mini-batch coresets found by gradient matching do not contain representative examples of the small sources w.h.p., and thus including all examples of the small sources in the mini-batch coresets is crucial for optimal performance. Second, we normalize the gradients by their historical exponential to find mini-batch coresets for training with Adam. Finally, we leverage zeroth-order methods to find smooth gradient of the last V-projection matrix and sparsify it to keep the dimensions with the largest normalized gradient magnitude. We apply CoLM to fine-tuning Phi-2, Phi-3, Zephyr, and Llama-3 models with LoRA on MathInstruct and SuperGLUE benchmark. Remarkably, CoLM reduces the memory requirement of fine-tuning by 2x and even outperforms training with 4x larger mini-batches. Moreover, CoLM seamlessly integrates with existing memory-efficient training methods like LoRA, further reducing the memory requirements of training LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/BigML-CS-UCLA/CoLM.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel Learning for Small Dataset Modeling in Semiconductor Fabrication: Application to Ohmic Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling complex semiconductor fabrication processes such as Ohmic contact formation remains challenging due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and limited experimental data. While classical machine learning (CML) approaches have been successful in many domains, their performance degrades in small-sample, nonlinear scenarios. In this work, we investigate quantum machine learning (QML) as an alternative, exploiting quantum kernels to capture intricate correlations from compact datasets. Using only 159 experimental GaN HEMT samples, we develop a quantum kernel-aligned regressor (QKAR) combining a shallow Pauli-Z feature map with a trainable quantum kernel alignment (QKA) layer. All models, including seven baseline CML regressors, are evaluated under a unified PCA-based preprocessing pipeline to ensure a fair comparison. QKAR consistently outperforms classical baselines across multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE), achieving a mean absolute error of 0.338 Omega mm when validated on experimental data. We further assess noise robustness and generalization through cross-validation and new device fabrication. These findings suggest that carefully constructed QML models could provide predictive advantages in data-constrained semiconductor modeling, offering a foundation for practical deployment on near-term quantum hardware. While challenges remain for both QML and CML, this study demonstrates QML's potential as a complementary approach in complex process modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Multi-Factor Network with Dynamic Sequence Modeling for Early Warning of Intraoperative Hypotension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) prediction using past physiological signals is crucial, as IOH may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and significantly elevate the risk of severe complications and mortality. However, current methods often rely on static modeling, overlooking the complex temporal dependencies and the inherently non-stationary nature of physiological signals. We propose a Hybrid Multi-Factor (HMF) network that formulates IOH prediction as a dynamic sequence forecasting task, explicitly capturing both temporal dependencies and physiological non-stationarity. We represent signal dynamics as multivariate time series and decompose them into trend and seasonal components, enabling separate modeling of long-term and periodic variations. Each component is encoded with a patch-based Transformer to balance computational efficiency and feature representation. To address distributional drift from evolving signals, we introduce a symmetric normalization mechanism. Experiments on both public and real-world clinical datasets show that HMF significantly outperforms competitive baselines. We hope HMF offers new insights into IOH prediction and ultimately promotes safer surgical care. Our code is available at https://github.com/Mingyue-Cheng/HMF.</description>

      <title>Criticality and Safety Margins for Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State of the art reinforcement learning methods sometimes encounter unsafe situations. Identifying when these situations occur is of interest both for post-hoc analysis and during deployment, where it might be advantageous to call out to a human overseer for help. Efforts to gauge the criticality of different points in time have been developed, but their accuracy is not well established due to a lack of ground truth, and they are not designed to be easily interpretable by end users. Therefore, we seek to define a criticality framework with both a quantifiable ground truth and a clear significance to users. We introduce true criticality as the expected drop in reward when an agent deviates from its policy for n consecutive random actions. We also introduce the concept of proxy criticality, a low-overhead metric that has a statistically monotonic relationship to true criticality. Safety margins make these interpretable, when defined as the number of random actions for which performance loss will not exceed some tolerance with high confidence. We demonstrate this approach in several environment-agent combinations; for an A3C agent in an Atari Beamrider environment, the lowest 5% of safety margins contain 47% of agent losses; i.e., supervising only 5% of decisions could potentially prevent roughly half of an agent's errors. This criticality framework measures the potential impacts of bad decisions, even before those decisions are made, allowing for more effective debugging and oversight of autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Rethinking GNN Expressive Power from a Distributed Computational Model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of graph neural networks (GNNs) has motivated theoretical studies on their expressive power, often through alignments with the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests. However, such analyses typically focus on the ability of GNNs to distinguish between graph structures, rather than to compute or approximate specific function classes. The latter is more commonly studied in machine learning theory, including results such as the Turing completeness of recurrent networks and the universal approximation property of feedforward networks. We argue that using well-defined computational models, such as a modified CONGEST model with clearly specified preprocessing and postprocessing, offers a more sound framework for analyzing GNN expressiveness. Within this framework, we show that allowing unrestricted preprocessing or incorporating externally computed features, while claiming that these precomputations enhance the expressiveness, can sometimes lead to problems. We also show that the lower bound on a GNN's capacity (depth multiplied by width) to simulate one iteration of the WL test actually grows nearly linearly with graph size, indicating that the WL test is not locally computable and is misaligned with message-passing GNNs. Despite these negative results, we also present positive results that characterize the effects of virtual nodes and edges from a computational model perspective. Finally, we highlight several open problems regarding GNN expressiveness for further exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently-computable geometrical-topological invariant that characterizes the global shape of data. In this paper, we introduce the Local Euler Characteristic Transform ($\ell$-ECT), a novel extension of the ECT particularly designed to enhance expressivity and interpretability in graph representation learning. Unlike traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which may lose critical local details through aggregation, the $\ell$-ECT provides a lossless representation of local neighborhoods. This approach addresses key limitations in GNNs by preserving nuanced local structures while maintaining global interpretability. Moreover, we construct a rotation-invariant metric based on $\ell$-ECTs for spatial alignment of data spaces. Our method exhibits superior performance compared to standard GNNs on a variety of node-classification tasks, while also offering theoretical guarantees that demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Limitations of Mamba in COPY and CoT Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have become the backbone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, their inference overhead grows linearly with the sequence length, posing challenges for modeling long sequences. In light of this, Mamba has attracted attention for maintaining a constant inference size, with empirical evidence demonstrating that it can match Transformer performance in sequence modeling while significantly reducing computational costs. However, an open question remains: can Mamba always bring savings while achieving performance comparable to Transformers? In this paper, we focus on analyzing the expressive ability of Mamba to perform our defined COPY operation and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. First, inspired by the connection between Mamba and linear attention, we show that constant-sized Mamba may struggle to perform COPY operations while Transformers can handle them more easily. However, when the size of Mamba grows linearly with the input sequence length, it can accurately perform COPY, but in this case, Mamba no longer provides overhead savings. Based on this observation, we further analyze Mamba's ability to tackle CoT tasks, which can be described by the Dynamic Programming (DP) problems. Our findings suggest that to solve arbitrary DP problems, the total cost of Mamba is still comparable to standard Transformers. However, similar to efficient Transformers, when facing DP problems with favorable properties such as locality, Mamba can provide savings in overhead. Our experiments on the copy and CoT tasks further demonstrate Mamba's limitations compared to Transformers in learning these tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model ensemble adversarial attack has become a powerful method for generating transferable adversarial examples that can target even unknown models, but its theoretical foundation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we provide early theoretical insights that serve as a roadmap for advancing model ensemble adversarial attack. We first define transferability error to measure the error in adversarial transferability, alongside concepts of diversity and empirical model ensemble Rademacher complexity. We then decompose the transferability error into vulnerability, diversity, and a constant, which rigidly explains the origin of transferability error in model ensemble attack: the vulnerability of an adversarial example to ensemble components, and the diversity of ensemble components. Furthermore, we apply the latest mathematical tools in information theory to bound the transferability error using complexity and generalization terms, contributing to three practical guidelines for reducing transferability error: (1) incorporating more surrogate models, (2) increasing their diversity, and (3) reducing their complexity in cases of overfitting. Finally, extensive experiments with 54 models validate our theoretical framework, representing a significant step forward in understanding transferable model ensemble adversarial attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-time event sequences, in which events occur at irregular intervals, are ubiquitous across a wide range of industrial and scientific domains. The contemporary modeling paradigm is to treat such data as realizations of a temporal point process, and in machine learning it is common to model temporal point processes in an autoregressive fashion using a neural network. While autoregressive models are successful in predicting the time of a single subsequent event, their performance can degrade when forecasting longer horizons due to cascading errors and myopic predictions. We propose EventFlow, a non-autoregressive generative model for temporal point processes. The model builds on the flow matching framework in order to directly learn joint distributions over event times, side-stepping the autoregressive process. EventFlow is simple to implement and achieves a 20%-53% lower error than the nearest baseline on standard TPP benchmarks while simultaneously using fewer model calls at sampling time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear radiation, which refers to the energy emitted from atomic nuclei during decay, poses significant risks to human health and environmental safety. Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</description>

Abstract: With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) &amp; robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</description>

      <title>Embedding Safety into RL: A New Take on Trust Region Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can solve diverse tasks but often exhibit unsafe behavior. Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) address this by enforcing safety constraints, yet existing methods either sacrifice reward maximization or allow unsafe training. We introduce Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), which reshapes the policy space geometry to ensure trust regions contain only safe policies, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction throughout training. We analyze its theoretical properties and connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Experiments show that C-TRPO reduces constraint violations while maintaining competitive returns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting a sequence of actions has been crucial in the success of recent behavior cloning algorithms in robotics. Can similar ideas improve reinforcement learning (RL)? We answer affirmatively by observing that incorporating action sequences when predicting ground-truth return-to-go leads to lower validation loss. Motivated by this, we introduce Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence (CQN-AS), a novel value-based RL algorithm that learns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions, i.e., explicitly training the value function to learn the consequence of executing action sequences. Our experiments show that CQN-AS outperforms several baselines on a variety of sparse-reward humanoid control and tabletop manipulation tasks from BiGym and RLBench.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence progresses towards the "Era of Experience," where agents are expected to learn from continuous, grounded interaction. We argue that traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL), which typically represents value as a scalar, can restrict agent's deep understanding of environments and hinders the active, deliberative learning crucial for navigating this new paradigm. To address the issue, we introduce Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (NLRL), a framework that extends RL principles into natural language counterparts. Central to NLRL is the Language Value Function (LVF), which redefines value as an interpretable linguistic narrative articulating the rationale behind an evaluation. NLRL further extends this concept to core RL components, including policy, the Bellman equation, and policy iteration. Leveraging recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), NLRL can be practically implemented to achieve RL-like policy and value training through unsupervised environment interactions. Experiments over 4 multi-step agentic tasks demonstrate NLRL's effectiveness, efficiency, and its potential to foster deeper understanding and more active learning strategies.</description>

      <title>AutoElicit: Using Large Language Models for Expert Prior Elicitation in Predictive Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17284v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire a breadth of information across various domains. However, their computational complexity, cost, and lack of transparency often hinder their direct application for predictive tasks where privacy and interpretability are paramount. In fields such as healthcare, biology, and finance, specialised and interpretable linear models still hold considerable value. In such domains, labelled data may be scarce or expensive to obtain. Well-specified prior distributions over model parameters can reduce the sample complexity of learning through Bayesian inference; however, eliciting expert priors can be time-consuming. We therefore introduce AutoElicit to extract knowledge from LLMs and construct priors for predictive models. We show these priors are informative and can be refined using natural language. We perform a careful study contrasting AutoElicit with in-context learning and demonstrate how to perform model selection between the two methods. We find that AutoElicit yields priors that can substantially reduce error over uninformative priors, using fewer labels, and consistently outperform in-context learning. We show that AutoElicit saves over 6 months of labelling effort when building a new predictive model for urinary tract infections from sensor recordings of people living with dementia.</description>

      <title>Multi-Label Bayesian Active Learning with Inter-Label Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary challenge of multi-label active learning, differing it from multi-class active learning, lies in assessing the informativeness of an indefinite number of labels while also accounting for the inherited label correlation. Existing studies either require substantial computational resources to leverage correlations or fail to fully explore label dependencies. Additionally, real-world scenarios often require addressing intrinsic biases stemming from imbalanced data distributions. In this paper, we propose a new multi-label active learning strategy to address both challenges. Our method incorporates progressively updated positive and negative correlation matrices to capture co-occurrence and disjoint relationships within the label space of annotated samples, enabling a holistic assessment of uncertainty rather than treating labels as isolated elements. Furthermore, alongside diversity, our model employs ensemble pseudo labeling and beta scoring rules to address data imbalances. Extensive experiments on four realistic datasets demonstrate that our strategy consistently achieves more reliable and superior performance, compared to several established methods.</description>

      <title>Federated Continual Graph Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Managing evolving graph data presents substantial challenges in storage and privacy, and training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such data often leads to catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they rely on centralized architectures and ignore the potential of distributed graph databases to leverage collective intelligence. To this end, we propose Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL) to adapt GNNs across multiple evolving graphs under storage and privacy constraints. Our empirical study highlights two core challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where clients lose prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To address these, we introduce POWER, a framework that preserves experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage locally to mitigate LGF, and leverages pseudo-prototype reconstruction with trajectory-aware knowledge transfer to resolve GEC. Experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superiority over federated adaptations of CGL baselines and vision-centric federated continual learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Go With the Flow: Fast Diffusion for Gaussian Mixture Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schrodinger Bridges (SBs) are diffusion processes that steer, in finite time, a given initial distribution to another final one while minimizing a suitable cost functional. Although various methods for computing SBs have recently been proposed in the literature, most of these approaches require computationally expensive training schemes, even for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an analytic parametrization of a set of feasible policies for steering the distribution of a dynamical system from one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to another. Instead of relying on standard non-convex optimization techniques, the optimal policy within the set can be approximated as the solution of a low-dimensional linear program whose dimension scales linearly with the number of components in each mixture. The proposed method generalizes naturally to more general classes of dynamical systems, such as controllable linear time-varying systems, enabling efficient solutions to multi-marginal momentum SB between GMMs, a challenging distribution interpolation problem. We showcase the potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems such as image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder, learning of cellular dynamics using multi-marginal momentum SB problems, and various other examples. We also test our approach on an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) benchmark problem and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cases where the boundary distributions are mixture models while requiring virtually no training.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models for continuous data gained widespread adoption owing to their high quality generation and control mechanisms. However, controllable diffusion on discrete data faces challenges given that continuous guidance methods do not directly apply to discrete diffusion. Here, we provide a straightforward derivation of classifier-free and classifier-based guidance for discrete diffusion, as well as a new class of diffusion models that leverage uniform noise and that are more guidable because they can continuously edit their outputs. We improve the quality of these models with a novel continuous-time variational lower bound that yields state-of-the-art performance, especially in settings involving guidance or fast generation. Empirically, we demonstrate that our guidance mechanisms combined with uniform noise diffusion improve controllable generation relative to autoregressive and diffusion baselines on several discrete data domains, including genomic sequences, small molecule design, and discretized image generation.</description>

      <title>GNNs-to-MLPs by Teacher Injection and Dirichlet Energy Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are pivotal in graph-based learning, particularly excelling in node classification. However, their scalability is hindered by the need for multi-hop data during inference, limiting their application in latency-sensitive scenarios. Recent efforts to distill GNNs into multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for faster inference often underutilize the layer-level insights of GNNs. In this paper, we present TINED, a novel approach that distills GNNs to MLPs on a layer-by-layer basis using Teacher Injection and Dirichlet Energy Distillation techniques. We focus on two key operations in GNN layers: feature transformation (FT) and graph propagation (GP). We recognize that FT is computationally equivalent to a fully-connected (FC) layer in MLPs. Thus, we propose directly transferring teacher parameters from an FT in a GNN to an FC layer in the student MLP, enhanced by fine-tuning. In TINED, the FC layers in an MLP replicate the sequence of FTs and GPs in the GNN. We also establish a theoretical bound for GP approximation. Furthermore, we note that FT and GP operations in GNN layers often exhibit opposing smoothing effects: GP is aggressive, while FT is conservative. Using Dirichlet energy, we develop a DE ratio to measure these effects and propose Dirichlet Energy Distillation to convey these characteristics from GNN layers to MLP layers. Extensive experiments show that TINED outperforms GNNs and leading distillation methods across various settings and seven datasets.

      <title>Constraint-Adaptive Policy Switching for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (OSRL) involves learning a decision-making policy to maximize rewards from a fixed batch of training data to satisfy pre-defined safety constraints. However, adapting to varying safety constraints during deployment without retraining remains an under-explored challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce constraint-adaptive policy switching (CAPS), a wrapper framework around existing offline RL algorithms. During training, CAPS uses offline data to learn multiple policies with a shared representation that optimize different reward and cost trade-offs. During testing, CAPS switches between those policies by selecting at each state the policy that maximizes future rewards among those that satisfy the current cost constraint. Our experiments on 38 tasks from the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that CAPS consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong wrapper-based baseline for OSRL. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yassineCh/CAPS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in business process management has advanced significantly, however, the full potential of these technologies remains largely unexplored, primarily due to challenges related to data quality and availability. We present a novel framework called Fine-Tuned Offline Reinforcement Learning Augmented Process Sequence Optimization (FORLAPS), which aims to identify optimal execution paths in business processes by leveraging reinforcement learning enhanced with a state-dependent reward shaping mechanism, thereby enabling context-sensitive prescriptions. Additionally, to compare FORLAPS with the existing models (Permutation Feature Importance and multi-task Long Short Term Memory model), we experimented to evaluate its effectiveness in terms of resource savings and process time reduction. The experimental results on real-life event logs validate that FORLAPS achieves 31% savings in resource time spent and a 23% reduction in process time span. To further enhance learning, we introduce an innovative process-aware data augmentation technique that selectively increases the average estimated Q-values in sampled batches, enabling automatic fine-tuning of the reinforcement learning model. Robustness was assessed through both prefix-level and trace-level evaluations, using the Damerau-Levenshtein distance as the primary metric. Finally, the model's adaptability across industries was further validated through diverse case studies, including healthcare treatment pathways, financial services workflows, permit applications from regulatory bodies, and operations management. In each domain, the proposed model demonstrated exceptional performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches in prescriptive decision-making, demonstrating its capability to prescribe optimal next steps and predict the best next activities within a process trace.</description>

      <title>Efficient Logit-based Knowledge Distillation of Deep Spiking Neural Networks for Full-Range Timestep Deployment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are emerging as a brain-inspired alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), prized for their potential energy efficiency on neuromorphic hardware. Despite this, SNNs often suffer from accuracy degradation compared to ANNs and face deployment challenges due to fixed inference timesteps, which require retraining for adjustments, limiting operational flexibility. To address these issues, our work considers the spatio-temporal property inherent in SNNs, and proposes a novel distillation framework for deep SNNs that optimizes performance across full-range timesteps without specific retraining, enhancing both efficacy and deployment adaptability. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical validations to illustrate that training guarantees the convergence of all implicit models across full-range timesteps. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among distillation-based SNNs training methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Intelli-Chip-Lab/snn\_temporal\_decoupling\_distillation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While attention-based models have demonstrated the remarkable ability of in-context learning (ICL), the theoretical understanding of how these models acquired this ability through gradient descent training is still preliminary. Towards answering this question, we study the gradient descent dynamics of multi-head linear self-attention trained for in-context linear regression. We examine two parametrizations of linear self-attention: one with the key and query weights merged as a single matrix (common in theoretical studies), and one with separate key and query matrices (closer to practical settings). For the merged parametrization, we show that the training dynamics has two fixed points and the loss trajectory exhibits a single, abrupt drop. We derive an analytical time-course solution for a certain class of datasets and initialization. For the separate parametrization, we show that the training dynamics has exponentially many fixed points and the loss exhibits saddle-to-saddle dynamics, which we reduce to scalar ordinary differential equations. During training, the model implements principal component regression in context with the number of principal components increasing over training time. Overall, we provide a theoretical description of how ICL abilities evolve during gradient descent training of linear attention, revealing abrupt acquisition or progressive improvements depending on how the key and query are parametrized.</description>

      <title>Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>A Variational Perspective on Generative Protein Fitness Optimization</title>

Abstract: The goal of protein fitness optimization is to discover new protein variants with enhanced fitness for a given use. The vast search space and the sparsely populated fitness landscape, along with the discrete nature of protein sequences, pose significant challenges when trying to determine the gradient towards configurations with higher fitness. We introduce Variational Latent Generative Protein Optimization (VLGPO), a variational perspective on fitness optimization. Our method embeds protein sequences in a continuous latent space to enable efficient sampling from the fitness distribution and combines a (learned) flow matching prior over sequence mutations with a fitness predictor to guide optimization towards sequences with high fitness. VLGPO achieves state-of-the-art results on two different protein benchmarks of varying complexity. Moreover, the variational design with explicit prior and likelihood functions offers a flexible plug-and-play framework that can be easily customized to suit various protein design tasks.</description>

      <title>PUATE: Efficient Average Treatment Effect Estimation from Treated (Positive) and Unlabeled Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of average treatment effects (ATEs), defined as the difference in expected outcomes between treatment and control groups, is a central topic in causal inference. This study develops semiparametric efficient estimators for ATE in a setting where only a treatment group and an unlabeled group, consisting of units whose treatment status is unknown, are observed. This scenario constitutes a variant of learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning) and can be viewed as a special case of ATE estimation with missing data. For this setting, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bounds, which characterize the lowest achievable asymptotic variance for regular estimators. We then construct semiparametric efficient ATE estimators that attain these bounds. Our results contribute to the literature on causal inference with missing data and weakly supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved superior performance in imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their rich expressiveness. However, the conventional diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and not scalable. To enable efficient training of diffusion policies in online RL, we generalize the conventional denoising score matching by reweighting the loss function. The resulting Reweighted Score Matching (RSM) preserves the optimal solution and low computational cost of denoising score matching, while eliminating the need to sample from the target distribution and allowing learning to optimize value functions. We introduce two tractable reweighted loss functions to solve two commonly used policy optimization problems, policy mirror descent and max-entropy policy, resulting in two practical algorithms named Diffusion Policy Mirror Descent (DPMD) and Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC). We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and the DPMD improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on Humanoid and Ant.</description>

      <title>Message-Passing GNNs Fail to Approximate Sparse Triangular Factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed as a tool for learning sparse matrix preconditioners, which are key components in accelerating linear solvers. This position paper argues that message-passing GNNs are fundamentally incapable of approximating sparse triangular factorizations. We demonstrate that message-passing GNNs fundamentally fail to approximate sparse triangular factorizations for classes of matrices for which high-quality preconditioners exist but require non-local dependencies. To illustrate this, we construct a set of baselines using both synthetic matrices and real-world examples from the SuiteSparse collection. Across a range of GNN architectures, including Graph Attention Networks and Graph Transformers, we observe severe performance degradation compared to exact or K-optimal factorizations, with cosine similarity dropping below $0.6$ in key cases. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that architectural innovations beyond message-passing are necessary for applying GNNs to scientific computing tasks such as matrix factorization. Experiments demonstrate that overcoming non-locality alone is insufficient. Tailored architectures are necessary to capture the required dependencies since even a completely non-local Graph Transformer fails to match the proposed baselines.</description>

      <title>Memento No More: Coaching AI Agents to Master Multiple Tasks via Hints Internalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the general capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) agents continue to evolve, their ability to learn to master multiple complex tasks through experience remains a key challenge. Current LLM agents, particularly those based on proprietary language models, typically rely on prompts to incorporate knowledge about the target tasks. This approach does not allow the agent to internalize this information and instead relies on ever-expanding prompts to sustain its functionality in diverse scenarios. This resembles a system of notes used by a person affected by anterograde amnesia, the inability to form new memories. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train AI agents to incorporate knowledge and skills for multiple tasks without the need for either cumbersome note systems or prior high-quality demonstration data. Our approach employs an iterative process where the agent collects new experiences, receives corrective feedback from humans in the form of hints, and integrates this feedback into its weights via a context distillation training procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by implementing it in a Llama-3-based agent that, after only a few rounds of feedback, outperforms advanced models GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in tasksets requiring correct sequencing of information retrieval, tool use, and question answering.</description>

      <title>Improving Rule-based Reasoning in LLMs using Neurosymbolic Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to face challenges in reliably solving reasoning tasks, particularly those that require precise rule following, as often found in mathematical reasoning. This paper introduces a novel neurosymbolic method that improves LLM reasoning by encoding hidden states into neurosymbolic vectors, enabling problem-solving within a neurosymbolic vector space. The results are decoded and merged with the original hidden state, significantly boosting the model's performance on numerical reasoning tasks. By offloading computation through neurosymbolic representations, this method enhances efficiency, reliability, and interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate an average of 88.6% lower cross-entropy loss and 15.4 times more problems correctly solved on a suite of mathematical reasoning tasks compared to chain-of-thought prompting and supervised fine-tuning (LoRA), without degrading performance on other tasks. We make our code available at: https://github.com/vdhanraj/Neurosymbolic-LLM.</description>

      <title>Robust LLM Alignment via Distributionally Robust Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is the issue of distribution shift. LLM alignment algorithms rely on static preference datasets, assuming that they accurately represent real-world user preferences. However, user preferences vary significantly across geographical regions, demographics, linguistic patterns, and evolving cultural trends. This preference distribution shift leads to catastrophic alignment failures in many real-world applications. We address this problem using the principled framework of distributionally robust optimization, and develop two novel distributionally robust direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithms, namely, Wasserstein DPO (WDPO) and Kullback-Leibler DPO (KLDPO). We characterize the sample complexity of learning the optimal policy parameters for WDPO and KLDPO. Moreover, we propose scalable gradient descent-style learning algorithms by developing suitable approximations for the challenging minimax loss functions of WDPO and KLDPO. Our empirical experiments using benchmark data sets and LLMs demonstrate the superior performance of WDPO and KLDPO in substantially improving the alignment when there is a preference distribution shift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization is characterized by a two-level optimization structure, where the upper-level problem is constrained by optimal lower-level solutions, and such structures are prevalent in real-world problems. The constraint by optimal lower-level solutions poses significant challenges, especially in noisy, constrained, and derivative-free settings, as repeating lower-level optimizations is sample inefficient and predicted lower-level solutions may be suboptimal. We present BILevel Bayesian Optimization (BILBO), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm for general bilevel problems with blackbox functions, which optimizes both upper- and lower-level problems simultaneously, without the repeated lower-level optimization required by existing methods. BILBO samples from confidence-bounds based trusted sets, which bounds the suboptimality on the lower level. Moreover, BILBO selects only one function query per iteration, where the function query selection strategy incorporates the uncertainty of estimated lower-level solutions and includes a conditional reassignment of the query to encourage exploration of the lower-level objective. The performance of BILBO is theoretically guaranteed with a sublinear regret bound for commonly used kernels and is empirically evaluated on several synthetic and real-world problems.</description>

      <title>ReGNet: Reciprocal Space-Aware Long-Range Modeling for Crystalline Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting properties of crystals from their structures is a fundamental yet challenging task in materials science. Unlike molecules, crystal structures exhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of capturing both local and global information effectively. However, most current works fall short of capturing long-range interactions within periodic structures. To address this limitation, we leverage \emph{reciprocal space} to efficiently encode long-range interactions with learnable filters within Fourier transforms. We introduce Reciprocal Geometry Network (ReGNet), a novel architecture that integrates geometric GNNs and reciprocal blocks to model short-range and long-range interactions, respectively. Experimental results on JARVIS, Materials Project, and MatBench demonstrate that ReGNet achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across a range of crystal property prediction tasks. Additionally, we explore a model extension that employs the mixture-of-experts for multi-property prediction with promising results and high computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of our model as a scalable and accurate solution for crystal property prediction. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>Robust Reward Alignment via Hypothesis Space Batch Cutting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reward design in reinforcement learning and optimal control is challenging. Preference-based alignment addresses this by enabling agents to learn rewards from ranked trajectory pairs provided by humans. However, existing methods often struggle from poor robustness to unknown false human preferences. In this work, we propose a robust and efficient reward alignment method based on a novel and geometrically interpretable perspective: hypothesis space batched cutting. Our method iteratively refines the reward hypothesis space through "cuts" based on batches of human preferences. Within each batch, human preferences, queried based on disagreement, are grouped using a voting function to determine the appropriate cut, ensuring a bounded human query complexity. To handle unknown erroneous preferences, we introduce a conservative cutting method within each batch, preventing erroneous human preferences from making overly aggressive cuts to the hypothesis space. This guarantees provable robustness against false preferences, while eliminating the need to explicitly identify them. We evaluate our method in a model predictive control setting across diverse tasks. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods in error-free settings while significantly outperforming existing methods when handling a high percentage of erroneous human preferences.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point in Building Structures with Differentiable Agents for Thermal Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03424v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fire safety is crucial for ensuring the stability of building structures, yet evaluating whether a structure meets fire safety requirement is challenging. Fires can originate at any point within a structure, and simulating every potential fire scenario is both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) and an efficient machine learning framework for its identification. The MFSP is defined as the location at which a fire, if initiated, would cause the most severe detrimental impact on the building's stability, effectively representing the worst-case fire scenario. In our framework, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) serves as an efficient and differentiable agent for conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulators by predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) under fire, which then guides the training and evaluation of the MFSP predictor. Additionally, we enhance our framework with a novel edge update mechanism and a transfer learning-based training scheme. Evaluations on a large-scale simulation dataset demonstrate the good performance of the proposed framework in identifying the MFSP, offering a transformative tool for optimizing fire safety assessments in structural design. All developed datasets and codes are open-sourced online.</description>

      <title>Path Planning for Masked Diffusion Model Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03540v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any order generation of discrete data using masked diffusion models (MDMs) offers a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive models, especially in domains that lack a natural causal ordering of data. However, current popular MDMs depart from their successful continuous diffusion model counterparts with simplified masked inference wherein unmasked tokens cannot be iteratively refined -- even if there is a mistake. In this paper, we extract the full power of MDMs by introducing a novel inference sampling strategy termed Path Planning (P2) that decomposes each generation step into two sub-stages: planning and denoising. Under P2, the planner at every step selects appropriate tokens that are marked to be updated, which can then be sampled using the denoiser. We demonstrate that P2 generalizes all existing sampling strategies for MDMs and critically enhances generative quality through the new capability of refining and updating existing unmasked tokens. We theoretically prove that P2 establishes a (new) expanded evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the log marginal likelihood of data. We instantiate P2 with a family of planners including: 1.) Self-Planning, 2.) BERT-Planning, and 3.) Trained-Planning with a learned planner leading to SOTA generative performance for MDMs on a suite of domains. Specifically, solely using P2 inference, we observe relative improvements of 22% in protein sequence foldability, 8% in RNA sequence pLDDT, 4% in math reasoning, 68% in story generation (ROUGE score), and 33% in code generation for the challenging pass@1 metric.</description>

Abstract: In principle, explanations are intended as a way to increase trust in machine learning models and are often obligated by regulations. However, many circumstances where these are demanded are adversarial in nature, meaning the involved parties have misaligned interests and are incentivized to manipulate explanations for their purpose. As a result, explainability methods fail to be operational in such settings despite the demand \cite{bordt2022post}. In this paper, we take a step towards operationalizing explanations in adversarial scenarios with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic primitive. Specifically we explore ZKP-amenable versions of the popular explainability algorithm LIME and evaluate their performance on Neural Networks and Random Forests.

      <title>Devil is in the Details: Density Guidance for Detail-Aware Generation with Flow Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, capable of producing high-quality images by mapping noise to a data distribution. However, recent findings suggest that image likelihood does not align with perceptual quality: high-likelihood samples tend to be smooth, while lower-likelihood ones are more detailed. Controlling sample density is thus crucial for balancing realism and detail. In this paper, we analyze an existing technique, Prior Guidance, which scales the latent code to influence image detail. We introduce score alignment, a condition that explains why this method works and show that it can be tractably checked for any continuous normalizing flow model. We then propose Density Guidance, a principled modification of the generative ODE that enables exact log-density control during sampling. Finally, we extend Density Guidance to stochastic sampling, ensuring precise log-density control while allowing controlled variation in structure or fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that these techniques provide fine-grained control over image detail without compromising sample quality.

      <title>Model Diffusion for Certifiable Few-shot Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contemporary deep learning, a prevalent and effective workflow for solving low-data problems is adapting powerful pre-trained foundation models (FMs) to new tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, while empirically effective, the resulting solutions lack generalisation guarantees to certify their accuracy - which may be required for ethical or legal reasons prior to deployment in high-importance applications. In this paper we develop a novel transfer learning approach that is designed to facilitate non-vacuous learning theoretic generalisation guarantees for downstream tasks, even in the low-shot regime. Specifically, we first use upstream tasks to train a distribution over PEFT parameters. We then learn the downstream task by a sample-and-evaluate procedure -- sampling plausible PEFTs from the trained diffusion model and selecting the one with the highest likelihood on the downstream data. Crucially, this confines our model hypothesis to a finite set of PEFT samples. In contrast to the typical continuous hypothesis spaces of neural network weights, this facilitates tighter risk certificates. We instantiate our bound and show non-trivial generalization guarantees compared to existing learning approaches which lead to vacuous bounds in the low-shot regime.</description>

      <title>Outsourced diffusion sampling: Efficient posterior inference in latent spaces of generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any well-behaved generative model over a variable $\mathbf{x}$ can be expressed as a deterministic transformation of an exogenous ('outsourced') Gaussian noise variable $\mathbf{z}$: $\mathbf{x}=f_\theta(\mathbf{z})$. In such a model (\eg, a VAE, GAN, or continuous-time flow-based model), sampling of the target variable $\mathbf{x} \sim p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ is straightforward, but sampling from a posterior distribution of the form $p(\mathbf{x}\mid\mathbf{y}) \propto p_\theta(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where $r$ is a constraint function depending on an auxiliary variable $\mathbf{y}$, is generally intractable. We propose to amortize the cost of sampling from such posterior distributions with diffusion models that sample a distribution in the noise space ($\mathbf{z}$). These diffusion samplers are trained by reinforcement learning algorithms to enforce that the transformed samples $f_\theta(\mathbf{z})$ are distributed according to the posterior in the data space ($\mathbf{x}$). For many models and constraints, the posterior in noise space is smoother than in data space, making it more suitable for amortized inference. Our method enables conditional sampling under unconditional GAN, (H)VAE, and flow-based priors, comparing favorably with other inference methods. We demonstrate the proposed outsourced diffusion sampling in several experiments with large pretrained prior models: conditional image generation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and protein structure generation.</description>

      <title>TransMLA: Migrating GQA Models to MLA with Full DeepSeek Compatibility and Speedup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07864v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present TransMLA, a framework that seamlessly converts any GQA-based pre-trained model into an MLA-based model. Our approach enables direct compatibility with DeepSeek's codebase, allowing these models to fully leverage DeepSeek-specific optimizations such as vLLM and SGlang. By compressing 93% of the KV cache in LLaMA-2-7B, TransMLA achieves a 10.6x inference speedup at an 8K context length while preserving meaningful output quality. Additionally, the model requires only 6 billion tokens for fine-tuning to regain performance on par with the original across multiple benchmarks. TransMLA offers a practical solution for migrating GQA-based models to the MLA structure. When combined with DeepSeek's advanced features, such as FP8 quantization and Multi-Token Prediction, even greater inference acceleration can be realized.</description>

      <title>You Do Not Fully Utilize Transformer's Representation Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to RNNs, which compress their history into a single hidden state, Transformers can attend to all past tokens directly. However, standard Transformers rely solely on the hidden state from the previous layer to represent the entire context. We show that this design choice induces representation collapse and degrades performance. To address this issue, we introduce Layer-Integrated Memory (LIMe), a lightweight extension that leverages existing key-value buffers and learns per-head, per-layer routing weights to integrate representations from all previous layers with negligible overhead. Through extensive experiments-including language modeling, synthetic reasoning benchmarks, and very deep architectures-LIMe consistently achieves faster convergence, lower perplexity per FLOP, and substantial accuracy improvements on synthetic tasks while preserving higher value-vector entropy and improved token separability. Finally, our analysis of the learned routing weights reveals systematic reuse of both local and long-distance features, demonstrating how LIMe mitigates collapse, unlocks richer representations without increasing hidden-state size, and points to promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>When do neural networks learn world models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans develop world models that capture the underlying generation process of data. Whether neural networks can learn similar world models remains an open problem. In this work, we present the first theoretical results for this problem, showing that in a multi-task setting, models with a low-degree bias provably recover latent data-generating variables under mild assumptions -- even if proxy tasks involve complex, non-linear functions of the latents. However, such recovery is sensitive to model architecture. Our analysis leverages Boolean models of task solutions via the Fourier-Walsh transform and introduces new techniques for analyzing invertible Boolean transforms, which may be of independent interest. We illustrate the algorithmic implications of our results and connect them to related research areas, including self-supervised learning, out-of-distribution generalization, and the linear representation hypothesis in large language models.</description>

      <title>DiffMS: Diffusion Generation of Molecules Conditioned on Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional de novo generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on de novo molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Discrete Diffusion with Causal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a flexible, controllable approach to structured sequence generation, yet they still lag behind causal language models in expressive power. A key limitation lies in their reliance on the Markovian assumption, which restricts each step to condition only on the current state, leading to potential uncorrectable error accumulation. In this paper, we introduce CaDDi, a discrete diffusion model that conditions on the entire generative trajectory, thereby lifting the Markov constraint and allowing the model to revisit and improve past states. By unifying sequential (causal) and temporal (diffusion) reasoning in a single non-Markovian transformer, CaDDi also treats standard causal language models as a special case and permits the direct reuse of pretrained LLM weights with no architectural changes. Empirically, CaDDi outperforms state-of-the-art discrete diffusion baselines on natural-language benchmarks, substantially narrowing the remaining gap to large autoregressive transformers.</description>

      <title>Solving Empirical Bayes via Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work applies modern AI tools (transformers) to solving one of the oldest statistical problems: Poisson means under empirical Bayes (Poisson-EB) setting. In Poisson-EB a high-dimensional mean vector $\theta$ (with iid coordinates sampled from an unknown prior $\pi$) is estimated on the basis of $X=\mathrm{Poisson}(\theta)$. A transformer model is pre-trained on a set of synthetically generated pairs $(X,\theta)$ and learns to do in-context learning (ICL) by adapting to unknown $\pi$. Theoretically, we show that a sufficiently wide transformer can achieve vanishing regret with respect to an oracle estimator who knows $\pi$ as dimension grows to infinity. Practically, we discover that already very small models (100k parameters) are able to outperform the best classical algorithm (non-parametric maximum likelihood, or NPMLE) both in runtime and validation loss, which we compute on out-of-distribution synthetic data as well as real-world datasets (NHL hockey, MLB baseball, BookCorpusOpen). Finally, by using linear probes, we confirm that the transformer's EB estimator appears to internally work differently from either NPMLE or Robbins' estimators.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Training Dynamics Reveal Learned Features and Linear Structure in Word2Vec-like Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised word embedding algorithms such as word2vec provide a minimal setting for studying representation learning in language modeling. We examine the quartic Taylor approximation of the word2vec loss around the origin, and we show that both the resulting training dynamics and the final performance on downstream tasks are empirically very similar to those of word2vec. Our main contribution is to analytically solve for both the gradient flow training dynamics and the final word embeddings in terms of only the corpus statistics and training hyperparameters. The solutions reveal that these models learn orthogonal linear subspaces one at a time, each one incrementing the effective rank of the embeddings until model capacity is saturated. Training on Wikipedia, we find that each of the top linear subspaces represents an interpretable topic-level concept. Finally, we apply our theory to describe how linear representations of more abstract semantic concepts emerge during training; these can be used to complete analogies via vector addition.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Weak-to-Strong Generalization in Theory and Practice: Reverse KL vs. Forward KL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models advance toward superhuman performance, ensuring their alignment with human values and abilities grows increasingly complex. Weak-to-strong generalization offers a promising approach by leveraging predictions from weaker models to guide stronger systems, but its effectiveness could be constrained by the inherent noise and inaccuracies in these weak predictions. To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded approach that replaces forward KL divergence-whose mass-covering behavior risks overfitting to imperfect weak signals-with reverse KL divergence. Reverse KL divergence's zero-forcing effect prioritizes high-confidence predictions, effectively mitigating the influence of unreliable weak supervision. Theoretically, we extend existing bounds and derive tighter lower bounds for both forward and reverse KL divergence, establishing that reverse KL achieves at least comparable guarantees to forward KL. Notably, when a sufficiently pre-trained strong model is fine-tuned on the last linear layer, reverse KL guarantees that it outperforms its weak supervisor by the magnitude of their disagreement. Empirically, we demonstrate that reverse KL and reverse cross-entropy enable strong models to successfully outperform those trained with forward KL and standard cross-entropy across most settings, highlighting the practical advantages of these reverse losses.</description>

      <title>MUDDFormer: Breaking Residual Bottlenecks in Transformers via Multiway Dynamic Dense Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose MUltiway Dynamic Dense (MUDD) connections, a simple yet effective method to address the limitations of residual connections and enhance cross-layer information flow in Transformers. Unlike existing dense connection approaches with static and shared connection weights, MUDD generates connection weights dynamically depending on hidden states at each sequence position and for each decoupled input stream (the query, key, value or residual) of a Transformer block. MUDD connections can be seamlessly integrated into any Transformer architecture to create MUDDFormer. Extensive experiments show that MUDDFormer significantly outperforms Transformers across various model architectures and scales in language modeling, achieving the performance of Transformers trained with 1.8X-2.4X compute. Notably, MUDDPythia-2.8B matches Pythia-6.9B in pretraining ppl and downstream tasks and even rivals Pythia-12B in five-shot settings, while adding only 0.23% parameters and 0.4% computation. Code in JAX and PyTorch and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Caiyun-AI/MUDDFormer .</description>

      <title>ReQFlow: Rectified Quaternion Flow for Efficient and High-Quality Protein Backbone Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein backbone generation plays a central role in de novo protein design and is significant for many biological and medical applications. Although diffusion and flow-based generative models provide potential solutions to this challenging task, they often generate proteins with undesired designability and suffer computational inefficiency. In this study, we propose a novel rectified quaternion flow (ReQFlow) matching method for fast and high-quality protein backbone generation. In particular, our method generates a local translation and a 3D rotation from random noise for each residue in a protein chain, which represents each 3D rotation as a unit quaternion and constructs its flow by spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) in an exponential format. We train the model by quaternion flow (QFlow) matching with guaranteed numerical stability and rectify the QFlow model to accelerate its inference and improve the designability of generated protein backbones, leading to the proposed ReQFlow model. Experiments show that ReQFlow achieves on-par performance in protein backbone generation while requiring much fewer sampling steps and significantly less inference time (e.g., being 37x faster than RFDiffusion and 63x faster than Genie2 when generating a backbone of length 300), demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/AngxiaoYue/ReQFlow.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problems with Deep Linear Neural Networks: Global Convergence Guarantees for Gradient Descent with Weight Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are commonly used to solve inverse problems, wherein an unknown signal must be estimated from few measurements generated via a known acquisition procedure. In particular, neural networks perform well empirically but have limited theoretical guarantees. In this work, we study an underdetermined linear inverse problem that admits several possible solution mappings. A standard remedy (e.g., in compressed sensing) establishing uniqueness of the solution mapping is to assume knowledge of latent low-dimensional structure in the source signal. We ask the following question: do deep neural networks adapt to this low-dimensional structure when trained by gradient descent with weight decay regularization? We prove that mildly overparameterized deep linear networks trained in this manner converge to an approximate solution that accurately solves the inverse problem while implicitly encoding latent subspace structure. To our knowledge, this is the first result to rigorously show that deep linear networks trained with weight decay automatically adapt to latent subspace structure in the data under practical stepsize and weight initialization schemes. Our work highlights that regularization and overparameterization improve generalization, while overparameterization also accelerates convergence during training.</description>

      <title>BatteryLife: A Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark for Battery Life Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Battery Life Prediction (BLP), which relies on time series data produced by battery degradation tests, is crucial for battery utilization, optimization, and production. Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.5 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 59 chemical systems, 9 operating temperatures, and 421 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in various neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, BatteryLife evaluates model performance across aging conditions and domains. BatteryLife is available at https://github.com/Ruifeng-Tan/BatteryLife.</description>

      <title>Explainable Multi-modal Time Series Prediction with LLM-in-the-Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow -- prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement -- continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9\% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.</description>

      <title>Wanda++: Pruning Large Language Models via Regional Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal accuracy impact. However, existing methods often suffer from accuracy degradation without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Moreover, despite updating weights with regional optimization, Wanda++ remains orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, further reducing perplexity with LoRA in great extend. Our approach is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single H100 GPU.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Visualizations of Data Spaces for Classification Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do classification models "see" our data? Based on their success in delineating behaviors, there must be some lens through which it is easy to see the boundary between classes; however, our current set of visualization techniques makes this prospect difficult. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised technique distinctly suited to visualizing the decision boundaries determined by classification problems. This method provides a human-interpretable map that can be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, which we demonstrate through visualizing and interpreting a decision boundary for chemical neurotoxicity. While we discuss this method in the context of chemistry-driven problems, its application can be generalized across subfields for "unboxing" the operations of machine-learning classification models.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards: GRPO's Effective Loss, Dynamics, and Success Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was introduced recently and used successfully to train DeepSeek-R1 models for promoting reasoning capabilities of LLMs using verifiable or binary rewards. We show in this paper that GRPO with verifiable rewards can be written as a Kullback--Leibler (KL) regularized contrastive loss, where the contrastive samples are synthetic data sampled from the old policy. The optimal GRPO policy $\pi_{n}$ can be expressed explicitly in terms of the binary reward, as well as the first- and second-order statistics of the old policy ($\pi_{n-1}$) and the reference policy $\pi_{\text{ref}}$. Iterating this scheme, we obtain a sequence of policies $\pi_{n}$ for which we can quantify the probability of success $p_n$. We show that the probability of success of the policy satisfies a recurrence that converges to a fixed point of a function that depends on the initial probability of success $p_{\text{ref}}$ and the regularization parameter $\beta$ of the $KL$ regularizer. We show that the fixed point $p^*$ is guaranteed to be larger than $p_{\text{ref}}$, thereby demonstrating that GRPO effectively amplifies the probability of success of the policy.</description>

      <title>TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have recently become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. While fine-tuning LLMs enables domain adaptation, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and unseen datasets. Moreover, existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) still face challenges in handling non-stationary dynamics and distribution shifts, largely due to the lack of effective mechanisms for adaptation. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for time series forecasting that enhances the generalization and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant segments from a dedicated knowledge base, enriching the contextual representation of the input query. Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Retrieval Mixer (ARM) module that dynamically fuses the retrieved patterns with the TSFM's internal representation, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming the existing TSFMs by up to 6.84% across diverse domains while also providing desirable interpretability.</description>

      <title>Language-Enhanced Representation Learning for Single-Cell Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers detailed insights into cellular heterogeneity. Recent advancements leverage single-cell large language models (scLLMs) for effective representation learning. These models focus exclusively on transcriptomic data, neglecting complementary biological knowledge from textual descriptions. To overcome this limitation, we propose scMMGPT, a novel multimodal framework designed for language-enhanced representation learning in single-cell transcriptomics. Unlike existing methods, scMMGPT employs robust cell representation extraction, preserving quantitative gene expression data, and introduces an innovative two-stage pre-training strategy combining discriminative precision with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scMMGPT significantly outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines across key downstream tasks, including cell annotation and clustering, and exhibits superior generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.</description>

      <title>In-Context Linear Regression Demystified: Training Dynamics and Mechanistic Interpretability of Multi-Head Softmax Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how multi-head softmax attention models are trained to perform in-context learning on linear data. Through extensive empirical experiments and rigorous theoretical analysis, we demystify the emergence of elegant attention patterns: a diagonal and homogeneous pattern in the key-query (KQ) weights, and a last-entry-only and zero-sum pattern in the output-value (OV) weights. Remarkably, these patterns consistently appear from gradient-based training starting from random initialization. Our analysis reveals that such emergent structures enable multi-head attention to approximately implement a debiased gradient descent predictor -- one that outperforms single-head attention and nearly achieves Bayesian optimality up to proportional factor. Furthermore, compared to linear transformers, the softmax attention readily generalizes to sequences longer than those seen during training. We also extend our study to scenarios with anisotropic covariates and multi-task linear regression. In the former, multi-head attention learns to implement a form of pre-conditioned gradient descent. In the latter, we uncover an intriguing regime where the interplay between head number and task number triggers a superposition phenomenon that efficiently resolves multi-task in-context learning. Our results reveal that in-context learning ability emerges from the trained transformer as an aggregated effect of its architecture and the underlying data distribution, paving the way for deeper understanding and broader applications of in-context learning.</description>

      <title>MultiScale Contextual Bandits for Long Term Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The feedback that AI systems (e.g., recommender systems, chatbots) collect from user interactions is a crucial source of training data. While short-term feedback (e.g., clicks, engagement) is widely used for training, there is ample evidence that optimizing short-term feedback does not necessarily achieve the desired long-term objectives. Unfortunately, directly optimizing for long-term objectives is challenging, and we identify the disconnect in the timescales of short-term interventions (e.g., rankings) and the long-term feedback (e.g., user retention) as one of the key obstacles. To overcome this disconnect, we introduce the framework of MultiScale Policy Learning to contextually reconcile that AI systems need to act and optimize feedback at multiple interdependent timescales. Following a PAC-Bayes motivation, we show how the lower timescales with more plentiful data can provide a data-dependent hierarchical prior for faster learning at higher scales, where data is more scarce. As a result, the policies at all levels effectively optimize for the long-term. We instantiate the framework with MultiScale Off-Policy Bandit Learning (MSBL) and demonstrate its effectiveness on three tasks relating to recommender and conversational systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Verifiable Rewards: Scaling Reinforcement Learning for Language Models to Unverifiable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to scale RL to unverifiable data with a novel algorithm JEPO (Jensen's Evidence lower bound Policy Optimization). While most prior efforts on scaling RL for LLMs focus on verifiable data where ground truth answers are typically short-form and can be matched easily; we investigate the case where such assumptions are less valid (e.g., when answers are long-form such as mathematical proofs). To scale RL training to unverifiable data with contemporary training constraints, we propose JEPO. JEPO applies Jensen's evidence lower bound, a pragmatic simplification of the evidence lower bound which views chain-of-thought as a latent variable in the generative process. We show that on verifiable data (math), JEPO is as effective as RL with verifiable rewards; on semi-verifiable data (numina), JEPO improves on soft-match based evaluations compared to RL with verifiable rewards which can only leverage a subset of the data source; finally, on unverifiable data (numina-proof), JEPO outperforms SFT and a few ablation baselines on likelihood evaluations.</description>

      <title>Improving User Behavior Prediction: Leveraging Annotator Metadata in Supervised Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised machine-learning models often underperform in predicting user behaviors from conversational text, hindered by poor crowdsourced label quality and low NLP task accuracy. We introduce the Metadata-Sensitive Weighted-Encoding Ensemble Model (MSWEEM), which integrates annotator meta-features like fatigue and speeding. First, our results show MSWEEM outperforms standard ensembles by 14% on held-out data and 12% on an alternative dataset. Second, we find that incorporating signals of annotator behavior, such as speed and fatigue, significantly boosts model performance. Third, we find that annotators with higher qualifications, such as Master's, deliver more consistent and faster annotations. Given the increasing uncertainty over annotation quality, our experiments show that understanding annotator patterns is crucial for enhancing model accuracy in user behavior prediction.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the impact of expert knowledge: How decision support scores impact the effectiveness of automatic knowledge-driven feature engineering (aKDFE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adverse Drug Events (ADEs), harmful medication effects, pose significant healthcare challenges, impacting patient safety and costs. This study evaluates automatic Knowledge-Driven Feature Engineering (aKDFE) for improved ADE prediction from Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, comparing it with automated event-based Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). We investigated how incorporating domain-specific ADE risk scores for prolonged heart QT interval, extracted from the Janusmed Riskprofile (Janusmed) Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), affects prediction performance using EHR data and medication handling events. Results indicate that, while aKDFE step 1 (event-based feature generation) alone did not significantly improve ADE prediction performance, aKDFE step 2 (patient-centric transformation) enhances the prediction performance. High Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) values suggest strong feature correlations to the outcome, aligning with the predictive power of patients' prior healthcare history for ADEs. Statistical analysis did not confirm that incorporating the Janusmed information (i) risk scores and (ii) medication route of administration into the model's feature set enhanced predictive performance. However, the patient-centric transformation applied by aKDFE proved to be a highly effective feature engineering approach. Limitations include a single-project focus, potential bias from machine learning pipeline methods, and reliance on AUROC. In conclusion, aKDFE, particularly with patient-centric transformation, improves ADE prediction from EHR data. Future work will explore attention-based models, event feature sequences, and automatic methods for incorporating domain knowledge into the aKDFE framework.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Sampling: Highly Scalable Diffusion Samplers via Adjoint Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Adjoint Sampling, a highly scalable and efficient algorithm for learning diffusion processes that sample from unnormalized densities, or energy functions. It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.</description>

      <title>GraphOmni: A Comprehensive and Extendable Benchmark Framework for Large Language Models on Graph-theoretic Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces GraphOmni, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on graph-theoretic tasks articulated in natural language. GraphOmni encompasses diverse graph types, serialization formats, and prompting schemes, significantly exceeding prior efforts in both scope and depth. Through extensive systematic evaluation, we identify critical interactions among these dimensions, demonstrating their substantial impact on model performance. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art models like Claude-3.5 and o4-mini consistently outperform other models, yet even these leading models exhibit substantial room for improvement. Performance variability is evident depending on the specific combinations of factors we considered, underscoring the necessity of comprehensive evaluations across these interconnected dimensions. Additionally, we observe distinct impacts of serialization and prompting strategies between open-source and closed-source models, encouraging the development of tailored approaches. Motivated by the findings, we also propose a reinforcement learning-inspired framework that adaptively selects the optimal factors influencing LLM reasoning capabilities. This flexible and extendable benchmark not only deepens our understanding of LLM performance on structured tasks but also provides a robust foundation for advancing research in LLM-based graph reasoning. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/GAI-Community/GraphOmni.</description>

      <title>Addressing Concept Mislabeling in Concept Bottleneck Models Through Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) propose to enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems by constraining their decisions on a set of human understandable concepts. However, CBMs typically assume that datasets contains accurate concept labels an assumption often violated in practice, which we show can significantly degrade performance (by 25% in some cases). To address this, we introduce the Concept Preference Optimization (CPO) objective, a new loss function based on Direct Preference Optimization, which effectively mitigates the negative impact of concept mislabeling on CBM performance. We provide an analysis on some key properties of the CPO objective showing it directly optimizes for the concept's posterior distribution, and contrast it against Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) where we show CPO is inherently less sensitive to concept noise. We empirically confirm our analysis finding that CPO consistently outperforms BCE in three real world datasets with and without added label noise.</description>

Abstract: Machine-learning-based surrogate models offer significant computational efficiency and faster simulations compared to traditional numerical methods, especially for problems requiring repeated evaluations of partial differential equations. This work introduces the Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer (GINOT), which integrates the transformer architecture with the neural operator framework to enable forward predictions for arbitrary geometries. GINOT encodes the surface points cloud of a geometry using a sampling and grouping mechanism combined with an attention mechanism, ensuring invariance to point order and padding while maintaining robustness to variations in point density. The geometry information is seamlessly integrated with query points in the solution decoder through the attention mechanism. The performance of GINOT is validated on multiple challenging datasets, showcasing its high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities for complex and arbitrary 2D and 3D geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative modeling of non-negative, discrete data, such as symbolic music, remains challenging due to two persistent limitations in existing methods. Firstly, many approaches rely on modeling continuous embeddings, which is suboptimal for inherently discrete data distributions. Secondly, most models optimize variational bounds rather than exact data likelihood, resulting in inaccurate likelihood estimates and degraded sampling quality. While recent diffusion-based models have addressed these issues separately, we tackle them jointly. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), inspired by photon arrival process, which combines exact likelihood estimation with fully discrete-state modeling. Central to our approach is an information-theoretic Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) that has a provable exact relationship with the true data likelihood. ItDPDM achieves improved likelihood and sampling performance over prior discrete and continuous diffusion models on a variety of synthetic discrete datasets. Furthermore, on real-world datasets such as symbolic music and images, ItDPDM attains superior likelihood estimates and competitive generation quality-demonstrating a proof of concept for distribution-robust discrete generative modeling.</description>

Abstract: Biological brains demonstrate complex neural activity, where the timing and interplay between neurons is critical to how brains process information. Most deep learning architectures simplify neural activity by abstracting away temporal dynamics. In this paper we challenge that paradigm. By incorporating neuron-level processing and synchronization, we can effectively reintroduce neural timing as a foundational element. We present the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), a model designed to leverage neural dynamics as its core representation. The CTM has two core innovations: (1) neuron-level temporal processing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process a history of incoming signals; and (2) neural synchronization employed as a latent representation. The CTM aims to strike a balance between oversimplified neuron abstractions that improve computational efficiency, and biological realism. It operates at a level of abstraction that effectively captures essential temporal dynamics while remaining computationally tractable for deep learning. We demonstrate the CTM's strong performance and versatility across a range of challenging tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, solving 2D mazes, sorting, parity computation, question-answering, and RL tasks. Beyond displaying rich internal representations and offering a natural avenue for interpretation owing to its internal process, the CTM is able to perform tasks that require complex sequential reasoning. The CTM can also leverage adaptive compute, where it can stop earlier for simpler tasks, or keep computing when faced with more challenging instances. The goal of this work is to share the CTM and its associated innovations, rather than pushing for new state-of-the-art results. To that end, we believe the CTM represents a significant step toward developing more biologically plausible and powerful artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Identifying Causal Direction via Variational Bayesian Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution, when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model fitness and computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an interpretation of the codelengths. Consequently, we can enhance the model fitness while promoting the succinctness of the codelengths, while avoiding the significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the overall performance of related complexity-based and structural causal model regression-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Exploring Criteria of Loss Reweighting to Enhance LLM Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loss reweighting has shown significant benefits for machine unlearning with large language models (LLMs). However, their exact functionalities are left unclear and the optimal strategy remains an open question, thus impeding the understanding and improvement of existing methodologies. In this paper, we identify two distinct goals of loss reweighting, namely, Saturation and Importance -- the former indicates that those insufficiently optimized data should be emphasized, while the latter stresses some critical data that are most influential for loss minimization. To study their usefulness, we design specific reweighting strategies for each goal and evaluate their respective effects on unlearning. We conduct extensive empirical analyses on well-established benchmarks, and summarize some important observations as follows: (i) Saturation enhances efficacy more than importance-based reweighting, and their combination can yield additional improvements. (ii) Saturation typically allocates lower weights to data with lower likelihoods, whereas importance-based reweighting does the opposite. (iii) The efficacy of unlearning is also largely influenced by the smoothness and granularity of the weight distributions. Based on these findings, we propose SatImp, a simple reweighting method that combines the advantages of both saturation and importance. Empirical results on extensive datasets validate the efficacy of our method, potentially bridging existing research gaps and indicating directions for future research. Our code is available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/SatImp.</description>

      <title>Training on Plausible Counterfactuals Removes Spurious Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plausible counterfactual explanations (p-CFEs) are perturbations that minimally modify inputs to change classifier decisions while remaining plausible under the data distribution. In this study, we demonstrate that classifiers can be trained on p-CFEs labeled with induced \emph{incorrect} target classes to classify unperturbed inputs with the original labels. While previous studies have shown that such learning is possible with adversarial perturbations, we extend this paradigm to p-CFEs. Interestingly, our experiments reveal that learning from p-CFEs is even more effective: the resulting classifiers achieve not only high in-distribution accuracy but also exhibit significantly reduced bias with respect to spurious correlations.</description>

      <title>Backdoors in DRL: Four Environments Focusing on In-distribution Triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks, or trojans, pose a security risk by concealing undesirable behavior in deep neural network models. Open-source neural networks are downloaded from the internet daily, possibly containing backdoors, and third-party model developers are common. To advance research on backdoor attack mitigation, we develop several trojans for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents. We focus on in-distribution triggers, which occur within the agent's natural data distribution, since they pose a more significant security threat than out-of-distribution triggers due to their ease of activation by the attacker during model deployment. We implement backdoor attacks in four reinforcement learning (RL) environments: LavaWorld, Randomized LavaWorld, Colorful Memory, and Modified Safety Gymnasium. We train various models, both clean and backdoored, to characterize these attacks. We find that in-distribution triggers can require additional effort to implement and be more challenging for models to learn, but are nevertheless viable threats in DRL even using basic data poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>C-LoRA: Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation for Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a cost-effective solution for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but it often produces overconfident predictions in data-scarce few-shot settings. To address this issue, several classical statistical learning approaches have been repurposed for scalable uncertainty-aware LoRA fine-tuning. However, these approaches neglect how input characteristics affect the predictive uncertainty estimates. To address this limitation, we propose Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation (\textbf{C-LoRA}) as a novel uncertainty-aware and parameter efficient fine-tuning approach, by developing new lightweight LoRA modules contextualized to each input data sample to dynamically adapt uncertainty estimates. Incorporating data-driven contexts into the parameter posteriors, C-LoRA mitigates overfitting, achieves well-calibrated uncertainties, and yields robust predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-LoRA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware LoRA methods in both uncertainty quantification and model generalization. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of our contextual modules in capturing sample-specific uncertainties. C-LoRA sets a new standard for robust, uncertainty-aware LLM fine-tuning in few-shot regimes.</description>

      <title>Bridging Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning in Math Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has played a central role in the recent surge of LLMs' math abilities by enabling self-improvement through binary verifier signals. In contrast, Supervised Learning (SL) is rarely considered for such verification-driven training, largely due to its heavy reliance on reference answers and inability to reflect on mistakes. In this work, we challenge the prevailing notion that self-improvement is exclusive to RL and propose Negative-aware Fine-Tuning (NFT) -- a supervised approach that enables LLMs to reflect on their failures and improve autonomously with no external teachers. In online training, instead of throwing away self-generated negative answers, NFT constructs an implicit negative policy to model them. This implicit policy is parameterized with the same positive LLM we target to optimize on positive data, enabling direct policy optimization on all LLMs' generations. We conduct experiments on 7B and 32B models in math reasoning tasks. Results consistently show that through the additional leverage of negative feedback, NFT significantly improves over SL baselines like Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning, matching or even surpassing leading RL algorithms like GRPO and DAPO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NFT and GRPO are actually equivalent in strict-on-policy training, even though they originate from entirely different theoretical foundations. Our experiments and theoretical findings bridge the gap between SL and RL methods in binary-feedback learning systems.</description>

      <title>GenPO: Generative Diffusion Models Meet On-Policy Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the powerful exploration capabilities and multimodality of generative diffusion-based policies. While substantial progress has been made in offline RL and off-policy RL settings, integrating diffusion policies into on-policy frameworks like PPO remains underexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the widespread use of large-scale parallel GPU-accelerated simulators, such as IsaacLab, which are optimized for on-policy RL algorithms and enable rapid training of complex robotic tasks. A key challenge lies in computing state-action log-likelihoods under diffusion policies, which is straightforward for Gaussian policies but intractable for flow-based models due to irreversible forward-reverse processes and discretization errors (e.g., Euler-Maruyama approximations). To bridge this gap, we propose GenPO, a generative policy optimization framework that leverages exact diffusion inversion to construct invertible action mappings. GenPO introduces a novel doubled dummy action mechanism that enables invertibility via alternating updates, resolving log-likelihood computation barriers. Furthermore, we also use the action log-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling KL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates. Extensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion (Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow Hand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate GenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines. Notably, GenPO is the first method to successfully integrate diffusion policies into on-policy RL, unlocking their potential for large-scale parallelized training and real-world robotic deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful data-driven frameworks for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering significant speedups over numerical methods. However, existing neural operators struggle with scalability in high-dimensional spaces, incur high computational costs, and face challenges in capturing continuous and long-range dependencies in PDE dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce the Latent Mamba Operator (LaMO), which integrates the efficiency of state-space models (SSMs) in latent space with the expressive power of kernel integral formulations in neural operators. We also establish a theoretical connection between state-space models (SSMs) and the kernel integral of neural operators. Extensive experiments across diverse PDE benchmarks on regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds covering solid and fluid physics datasets, LaMOs achieve consistent state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with a 32.3% improvement over existing baselines in solution operator approximation, highlighting its efficacy in modeling complex PDE solutions.</description>

      <title>OptiMindTune: A Multi-Agent Framework for Intelligent Hyperparameter Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a critical yet challenging aspect of machine learning model development, significantly impacting model performance and generalization. Traditional HPO methods often struggle with high dimensionality, complex interdependencies, and computational expense. This paper introduces OptiMindTune, a novel multi-agent framework designed to intelligently and efficiently optimize hyperparameters. OptiMindTune leverages the collaborative intelligence of three specialized AI agents -- a Recommender Agent, an Evaluator Agent, and a Decision Agent -- each powered by Google's Gemini models. These agents address distinct facets of the HPO problem, from model selection and hyperparameter suggestion to robust evaluation and strategic decision-making. By fostering dynamic interactions and knowledge sharing, OptiMindTune aims to converge to optimal hyperparameter configurations more rapidly and robustly than existing single-agent or monolithic approaches. Our framework integrates principles from advanced large language models, and adaptive search to achieve scalable and intelligent AutoML. We posit that this multi-agent paradigm offers a promising avenue for tackling the increasing complexity of modern machine learning model tuning.</description>

      <title>VTool-R1: VLMs Learn to Think with Images via Reinforcement Learning on Multimodal Tool Use</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RFT) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling long chains of thought, self-correction, and effective tool use. While recent works attempt to extend RFT to vision-language models (VLMs), these efforts largely produce text-only reasoning conditioned on static image inputs, falling short of true multimodal reasoning in the response. In contrast, test-time methods like Visual Sketchpad incorporate visual steps but lack training mechanisms.
  We introduce VTool-R1, the first framework that trains VLMs to generate multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal chain of thoughts with tools.</description>

      <title>Towards Large Reasoning Models for Agriculture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agricultural decision-making involves complex, context-specific reasoning, where choices about crops, practices, and interventions depend heavily on geographic, climatic, and economic conditions. Traditional large language models (LLMs) often fall short in navigating this nuanced problem due to limited reasoning capacity. We hypothesize that recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) can better handle such structured, domain-specific inference. To investigate this, we introduce AgReason, the first expert-curated open-ended science benchmark with 100 questions for agricultural reasoning. Evaluations across thirteen open-source and proprietary models reveal that LRMs outperform conventional ones, though notable challenges persist, with the strongest Gemini-based baseline achieving 36% accuracy. We also present AgThoughts, a large-scale dataset of 44.6K question-answer pairs generated with human oversight and equipped with synthetically generated reasoning traces. Using AgThoughts, we develop AgThinker, a suite of small reasoning models that can be run on consumer-grade GPUs, and show that our dataset can be effective in unlocking agricultural reasoning abilities in LLMs. Our project page is here: https://baskargroup.github.io/Ag_reasoning/</description>

      <title>JEDI: Latent End-to-end Diffusion Mitigates Agent-Human Performance Asymmetry in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) have achieved super-human level performance on the Atari100k benchmark, driven by reinforcement learning agents trained on powerful diffusion world models. However, we identify that the current aggregates mask a major performance asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in some tasks despite drastically underperforming in others, with the former inflating the aggregate metrics. This is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents trained with diffusion world models. In this work, we address the pronounced asymmetry observed in pixel-based agents as an initial attempt to reverse the worrying upward trend observed in them. We address the problematic aggregates by delineating all tasks as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal and advocate for equal importance on metrics from both sets. Next, we hypothesize this pronounced asymmetry is due to the lack of temporally-structured latent space trained with the World Model objective in pixel-based methods. Lastly, to address this issue, we propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI), a novel latent diffusion world model trained end-to-end with the self-consistency objective. JEDI outperforms SOTA models in human-optimal tasks while staying competitive across the Atari100k benchmark, and runs 3 times faster with 43% lower memory than the latest pixel-based diffusion baseline. Overall, our work rethinks what it truly means to cross human-level performance in Atari100k.</description>

      <title>Data-Distill-Net: A Data Distillation Approach Tailored for Reply-based Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replay-based continual learning (CL) methods assume that models trained on a small subset can also effectively minimize the empirical risk of the complete dataset. These methods maintain a memory buffer that stores a sampled subset of data from previous tasks to consolidate past knowledge. However, this assumption is not guaranteed in practice due to the limited capacity of the memory buffer and the heuristic criteria used for buffer data selection. To address this issue, we propose a new dataset distillation framework tailored for CL, which maintains a learnable memory buffer to distill the global information from the current task data and accumulated knowledge preserved in the previous memory buffer. Moreover, to avoid the computational overhead and overfitting risks associated with parameterizing the entire buffer during distillation, we introduce a lightweight distillation module that can achieve global information distillation solely by generating learnable soft labels for the memory buffer data. Extensive experiments show that, our method can achieve competitive results and effectively mitigates forgetting across various datasets. The source code will be publicly available.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models become increasingly prevalent, memory bandwidth constraints significantly limit inference throughput, motivating post-training quantization (PTQ). In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8, significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel, effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8 quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.</description>

      <title>Cooperation of Experts: Fusing Heterogeneous Information with Large Margin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fusing heterogeneous information remains a persistent challenge in modern data analysis. While significant progress has been made, existing approaches often fail to account for the inherent heterogeneity of object patterns across different semantic spaces. To address this limitation, we propose the Cooperation of Experts (CoE) framework, which encodes multi-typed information into unified heterogeneous multiplex networks. By overcoming modality and connection differences, CoE provides a powerful and flexible model for capturing the intricate structures of real-world complex data. In our framework, dedicated encoders act as domain-specific experts, each specializing in learning distinct relational patterns in specific semantic spaces. To enhance robustness and extract complementary knowledge, these experts collaborate through a novel large margin mechanism supported by a tailored optimization strategy. Rigorous theoretical analyses guarantee the framework's feasibility and stability, while extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and broad applicability.

      <title>Improved Bounds for Swap Multicalibration and Swap Omniprediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the related problems of multicalibration -- a multigroup fairness notion and omniprediction -- a simultaneous loss minimization paradigm, both in the distributional and online settings. The recent work of Garg et al. (2024) raised the open problem of whether it is possible to efficiently achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$ $\ell_{2}$-multicalibration error against bounded linear functions. In this paper, we answer this question in a strongly affirmative sense. We propose an efficient algorithm that achieves $O(T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ $\ell_{2}$-swap multicalibration error (both in high probability and expectation). On propagating this bound onward, we obtain significantly improved rates for $\ell_{1}$-swap multicalibration and swap omniprediction for a loss class of convex Lipschitz functions. In particular, we show that our algorithm achieves $O(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ $\ell_{1}$-swap multicalibration and swap omniprediction errors, thereby improving upon the previous best-known bound of $O(T^{\frac{7}{8}})$. As a consequence of our improved online results, we further obtain several improved sample complexity rates in the distributional setting. In particular, we establish a $O(\varepsilon ^ {-3})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning an $\varepsilon$-swap omnipredictor for the class of convex and Lipschitz functions, $O(\varepsilon ^{-2.5})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning an $\varepsilon$-swap agnostic learner for the squared loss, and $O(\varepsilon ^ {-5}), O(\varepsilon ^ {-2.5})$ sample complexities of learning $\ell_{1}, \ell_{2}$-swap multicalibrated predictors against linear functions, all of which significantly improve on the previous best-known bounds.</description>

      <title>Understanding the behavior of representation forgetting in continual learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continual learning scenarios, catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks is a critical issue, making it essential to effectively measure such forgetting. Recently, there has been growing interest in focusing on representation forgetting, the forgetting measured at the hidden layer. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of representation forgetting and use this analysis to better understand the behavior of continual learning. First, we introduce a new metric called representation discrepancy, which measures the difference between representation spaces constructed by two snapshots of a model trained through continual learning. We demonstrate that our proposed metric serves as an effective surrogate for the representation forgetting while remaining analytically tractable. Second, through mathematical analysis of our metric, we derive several key findings about the dynamics of representation forgetting: the forgetting occurs more rapidly to a higher degree as the layer index increases, while increasing the width of the network slows down the forgetting process. Third, we support our theoretical findings through experiments on real image datasets, including Split-CIFAR100 and ImageNet1K.</description>

      <title>Bridging Arbitrary and Tree Metrics via Differentiable Gromov Hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trees and the associated shortest-path tree metrics provide a powerful framework for representing hierarchical and combinatorial structures in data. Given an arbitrary metric space, its deviation from a tree metric can be quantified by Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity. Nonetheless, designing algorithms that bridge an arbitrary metric to its closest tree metric is still a vivid subject of interest, as most common approaches are either heuristical and lack guarantees, or perform moderately well. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable optimization framework, coined DeltaZero, that solves this problem. Our method leverages a smooth surrogate for Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity which enables a gradient-based optimization, with a tractable complexity. The corresponding optimization procedure is derived from a problem with better worst case guarantees than existing bounds, and is justified statistically. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art distortion.</description>

      <title>SageAttention2++: A More Efficient Implementation of SageAttention2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8 Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++ achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</description>

      <title>Copresheaf Topological Neural Networks: A Generalized Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce copresheaf topological neural networks (CTNNs), a powerful and unifying framework that encapsulates a wide spectrum of deep learning architectures, designed to operate on structured data: including images, point clouds, graphs, meshes, and topological manifolds. While deep learning has profoundly impacted domains ranging from digital assistants to autonomous systems, the principled design of neural architectures tailored to specific tasks and data types remains one of the field's most persistent open challenges. CTNNs address this gap by grounding model design in the language of copresheaves, a concept from algebraic topology that generalizes and subsumes most practical deep learning models in use today. This abstract yet constructive formulation yields a rich design space from which theoretically sound and practically effective solutions can be derived to tackle core challenges in representation learning: long-range dependencies, oversmoothing, heterophily, and non-Euclidean domains. Our empirical results on structured data benchmarks demonstrate that CTNNs consistently outperform conventional baselines, particularly in tasks requiring hierarchical or localized sensitivity. These results underscore CTNNs as a principled, multi-scale foundation for the next generation of deep learning architectures.</description>

      <title>OVERT: A Benchmark for Over-Refusal Evaluation on Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in generating visual content from text inputs. Although multiple safety alignment strategies have been proposed to prevent harmful outputs, they often lead to overly cautious behavior -- rejecting even benign prompts -- a phenomenon known as $\textit{over-refusal}$ that reduces the practical utility of T2I models. Despite over-refusal having been observed in practice, there is no large-scale benchmark that systematically evaluates this phenomenon for T2I models. In this paper, we present an automatic workflow to construct synthetic evaluation data, resulting in OVERT ($\textbf{OVE}$r-$\textbf{R}$efusal evaluation on $\textbf{T}$ext-to-image models), the first large-scale benchmark for assessing over-refusal behaviors in T2I models. OVERT includes 4,600 seemingly harmful but benign prompts across nine safety-related categories, along with 1,785 genuinely harmful prompts (OVERT-unsafe) to evaluate the safety-utility trade-off. Using OVERT, we evaluate several leading T2I models and find that over-refusal is a widespread issue across various categories (Figure 1), underscoring the need for further research to enhance the safety alignment of T2I models without compromising their functionality. As a preliminary attempt to reduce over-refusal, we explore prompt rewriting; however, we find it often compromises faithfulness to the meaning of the original prompts. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our generation framework in accommodating diverse safety requirements by generating customized evaluation data adapting to user-defined policies.</description>

      <title>Learning in Stackelberg Games with Non-myopic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Stackelberg games where a principal repeatedly interacts with a non-myopic long-lived agent, without knowing the agent's payoff function. Although learning in Stackelberg games is well-understood when the agent is myopic, dealing with non-myopic agents poses additional complications. In particular, non-myopic agents may strategize and select actions that are inferior in the present in order to mislead the principal's learning algorithm and obtain better outcomes in the future.
  We provide a general framework that reduces learning in presence of non-myopic agents to robust bandit optimization in the presence of myopic agents. Through the design and analysis of minimally reactive bandit algorithms, our reduction trades off the statistical efficiency of the principal's learning algorithm against its effectiveness in inducing near-best-responses. We apply this framework to Stackelberg security games (SSGs), pricing with unknown demand curve, general finite Stackelberg games, and strategic classification. In each setting, we characterize the type and impact of misspecifications present in near-best responses and develop a learning algorithm robust to such misspecifications.
  On the way, we improve the state-of-the-art query complexity of learning in SSGs with $n$ targets from $O(n^3)$ to a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(n)$ by uncovering a fundamental structural property of these games. The latter result is of independent interest beyond learning with non-myopic agents.</description>

      <title>Improving the Variance of Differentially Private Randomized Experiments through Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects from randomized experiments is only possible if participants are willing to disclose their potentially sensitive responses. Differential privacy, a widely used framework for ensuring an algorithms privacy guarantees, can encourage participants to share their responses without the risk of de-anonymization. However, many mechanisms achieve differential privacy by adding noise to the original dataset, which reduces the precision of causal effect estimation. This introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy and variance when performing causal analyses on differentially private data. In this work, we propose a new differentially private mechanism, "Cluster-DP", which leverages a given cluster structure in the data to improve the privacy-variance trade-off. While our results apply to any clustering, we demonstrate that selecting higher-quality clusters, according to a quality metric we introduce, can decrease the variance penalty without compromising privacy guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the theoretical and empirical performance of our Cluster-DP algorithm on both real and simulated data, comparing it to common baselines, including two special cases of our algorithm: its unclustered version and a uniform-prior version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08731v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using world models has found significant recent successes. However, when a sudden change to world mechanics or properties occurs then agent performance and reliability can dramatically decline. We refer to the sudden change in visual properties or state transitions as novelties. Implementing novelty detection within generated world model frameworks is a crucial task for protecting the agent when deployed. In this paper, we propose straightforward bounding approaches to incorporate novelty detection into world model RL agents, by utilizing the misalignment of the world model's hallucinated states and the true observed states as an anomaly score. We provide effective approaches to detecting novelties in a distribution of transitions learned by an agent in a world model. Finally, we show the advantage of our work in a novel environment compared to traditional machine learning novelty detection methods as well as currently accepted RL focused novelty detection algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in AI foundation models have significant potential for lightening the clinical workload by mimicking the comprehensive and multi-faceted approaches used by medical professionals. In the field of radiation oncology, the integration of multiple modalities holds great importance, so the opportunity of foundational model is abundant. Inspired by this, here we present RO-LMM, a multi-purpose, comprehensive large multimodal model (LMM) tailored for the field of radiation oncology. This model effectively manages a series of tasks within the clinical workflow, including clinical context summarization, radiation treatment plan suggestion, and plan-guided target volume segmentation by leveraging the capabilities of LMM. In particular, to perform consecutive clinical tasks without error accumulation, we present a novel Consistency Embedding Fine-Tuning (CEFTune) technique, which boosts LMM's robustness to noisy inputs while preserving the consistency of handling clean inputs. We further extend this concept to LMM-driven segmentation framework, leading to a novel Consistency Embedding Segmentation (CESEG) techniques. Experimental results including multi-centre validation confirm that our RO-LMM with CEFTune and CESEG results in promising performance for multiple clinical tasks with generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Meta Co-Training: Two Views are Better than One</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18083v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many critical computer vision scenarios unlabeled data is plentiful, but labels are scarce and difficult to obtain. As a result, semi-supervised learning which leverages unlabeled data to boost the performance of supervised classifiers have received significant attention in recent literature. One representative class of semi-supervised algorithms are co-training algorithms. Co-training algorithms leverage two different models which have access to different independent and sufficient representations or "views" of the data to jointly make better predictions. Each of these models creates pseudo-labels on unlabeled points which are used to improve the other model. We show that in the common case where independent views are not available, we can construct such views inexpensively using pre-trained models. Co-training on the constructed views yields a performance improvement over any of the individual views we construct and performance comparable with recent approaches in semi-supervised learning. We present Meta Co-Training, a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm, which has two advantages over co-training: (i) learning is more robust when there is large discrepancy between the information content of the different views, and (ii) does not require retraining from scratch on each iteration. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-10% achieving a ~4.7% reduction in error rate over prior work. Our method also outperforms prior semi-supervised work on several other fine-grained image classification datasets.</description>

      <title>Bridging Language, Vision and Action: Multimodal VAEs in Robotic Manipulation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on unsupervised vision-language-action mapping in the area of robotic manipulation. Recently, multiple approaches employing pre-trained large language and vision models have been proposed for this task. However, they are computationally demanding and require careful fine-tuning of the produced outputs. A more lightweight alternative would be the implementation of multimodal Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) which can extract the latent features of the data and integrate them into a joint representation, as has been demonstrated mostly on image-image or image-text data for the state-of-the-art models. Here we explore whether and how can multimodal VAEs be employed in unsupervised robotic manipulation tasks in a simulated environment. Based on the obtained results, we propose a model-invariant training alternative that improves the models' performance in a simulator by up to 55%. Moreover, we systematically evaluate the challenges raised by the individual tasks such as object or robot position variability, number of distractors or the task length. Our work thus also sheds light on the potential benefits and limitations of using the current multimodal VAEs for unsupervised learning of robotic motion trajectories based on vision and language.</description>

      <title>Decision-Focused Forecasting: A Differentiable Multistage Optimisation Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most decision-focused learning work has focused on single stage problems whereas many real-world decision problems are more appropriately modelled using multistage optimisation. In multistage problems contextual information is revealed over time, decisions have to be taken sequentially, and decisions now have an intertemporal effect on future decisions. Decision-focused forecasting is a recurrent differentiable optimisation architecture that expresses a fully differentiable multistage optimisation approach. This architecture enables us to account for the intertemporal decision effects of forecasts. We show what gradient adjustments are made to account for the state-path caused by forecasting. We apply the model to multistage problems in energy storage arbitrage and portfolio optimisation and report that our model outperforms existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Edit Distance Robust Watermarks via Indexing Pseudorandom Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of detecting AI-generated text, we consider the problem of watermarking the output of language models with provable guarantees. We aim for watermarks which satisfy: (a) undetectability, a cryptographic notion introduced by Christ, Gunn &amp; Zamir (2024) which stipulates that it is computationally hard to distinguish watermarked language model outputs from the model's actual output distribution; and (b) robustness to channels which introduce a constant fraction of adversarial insertions, substitutions, and deletions to the watermarked text. Earlier schemes could only handle stochastic substitutions and deletions, and thus we are aiming for a more natural and appealing robustness guarantee that holds with respect to edit distance.
  Our main result is a watermarking scheme which achieves both undetectability and robustness to edits when the alphabet size for the language model is allowed to grow as a polynomial in the security parameter. To derive such a scheme, we follow an approach introduced by Christ &amp; Gunn (2024), which proceeds via first constructing pseudorandom codes satisfying undetectability and robustness properties analogous to those above; our key idea is to handle adversarial insertions and deletions by interpreting the symbols as indices into the codeword, which we call indexing pseudorandom codes. Additionally, our codes rely on weaker computational assumptions than used in previous work. Then we show that there is a generic transformation from such codes over large alphabets to watermarking schemes for arbitrary language models.</description>

      <title>Empirical analysis of binding precedent efficiency in Brazilian Supreme Court via case classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binding precedents (s\'umulas vinculantes) constitute a juridical instrument unique to the Brazilian legal system and whose objectives include the protection of the Federal Supreme Court against repetitive demands. Studies of the effectiveness of these instruments in decreasing the Court's exposure to similar cases, however, indicate that they tend to fail in such a direction, with some of the binding precedents seemingly creating new demands. We empirically assess the legal impact of five binding precedents, 11, 14, 17, 26, and 37, at the highest Court level through their effects on the legal subjects they address. This analysis is only possible through the comparison of the Court's ruling about the precedents' themes before they are created, which means that these decisions should be detected through techniques of Similar Case Retrieval, which we tackle from the angle of Case Classification. The contributions of this article are therefore twofold: on the mathematical side, we compare the use of different methods of Natural Language Processing -- TF-IDF, LSTM, Longformer, and regex -- for Case Classification, whereas on the legal side, we contrast the inefficiency of these binding precedents with a set of hypotheses that may justify their repeated usage. We observe that the TF-IDF models performed slightly better than LSTM and Longformer when compared through common metrics; however, the deep learning models were able to detect certain important legal events that TF-IDF missed. On the legal side, we argue that the reasons for binding precedents to fail in responding to repetitive demand are heterogeneous and case-dependent, making it impossible to single out a specific cause. We identify five main hypotheses, which are found in different combinations in each of the precedents studied.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Mahalanobis Distance with Applications to Kernelized Novelty Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mahalanobis distance is a classical tool used to measure the covariance-adjusted distance between points in $\bbR^d$. In this work, we extend the concept of Mahalanobis distance to separable Banach spaces by reinterpreting it as a Cameron-Martin norm associated with a probability measure. This approach leads to a basis-free, data-driven notion of anomaly distance through the so-called variance norm, which can naturally be estimated using empirical measures of a sample. Our framework generalizes the classical $\bbR^d$, functional $(L^2[0,1])^d$, and kernelized settings; importantly, it incorporates non-injective covariance operators. We prove that the variance norm is invariant under invertible bounded linear transformations of the data, extending previous results which are limited to unitary operators. In the Hilbert space setting, we connect the variance norm to the RKHS of the covariance operator and establish consistency and convergence results for estimation using empirical measures. Using the variance norm, we introduce the notion of a kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance. In an empirical study on 12 real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance outperforms the traditional kernelized Mahalanobis distance for multivariate time series novelty detection, using state-of-the-art time series kernels such as the signature, global alignment, and Volterra reservoir kernels.</description>

      <title>Base and Exponent Prediction in Mathematical Expressions using Multi-Output CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of neural networks and deep learning techniques in image processing has significantly advanced the field, enabling highly accurate recognition results. However, achieving high recognition rates often necessitates complex network models, which can be challenging to train and require substantial computational resources. This research presents a simplified yet effective approach to predicting both the base and exponent from images of mathematical expressions using a multi-output Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on 10,900 synthetically generated images containing exponent expressions, incorporating random noise, font size variations, and blur intensity to simulate real-world conditions. The proposed CNN model demonstrates robust performance with efficient training time. The experimental results indicate that the model achieves high accuracy in predicting the base and exponent values, proving the efficacy of this approach in handling noisy and varied input images.</description>

      <title>LAMBDA: A Large Model Based Data Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LArge Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that leverages the power of large language models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</description>

      <title>Topological Eigenvalue Theorems for Tensor Analysis in Multi-Modal Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for tensor eigenvalue analysis in the context of multi-modal data fusion, leveraging topological invariants such as Betti numbers. Traditional approaches to tensor eigenvalue analysis often extend matrix theory, whereas this work introduces a topological perspective to enhance the understanding of tensor structures. By establishing new theorems that link eigenvalues to topological features, the proposed framework provides deeper insights into the latent structure of data, improving both interpretability and robustness. Applications in data fusion demonstrate the theoretical and practical significance of this approach, with potential for broad impact in machine learning and data science.</description>

      <title>On the Within-class Variation Issue in Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Different from conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Therefore, simplistic binary AD classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class heterogeneity and instance-level imbalance. In this work, we found using a sample score estimator can generate sample-specific soft scores aligning with cognitive scores. We subsequently propose two simple yet effective methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Based on the ADReSS and CU-MARVEL corpora, we demonstrated and analyzed the advantages of the proposed approaches in detection performance. These findings provide insights for developing robust and reliable AD detection models.</description>

      <title>Shielded Diffusion: Generating Novel and Diverse Images using Sparse Repellency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of text-to-image diffusion models raises concerns over reliability, drawing scrutiny under the lens of various metrics like calibration, fairness, or compute efficiency. We focus in this work on two issues that arise when deploying these models: a lack of diversity when prompting images, and a tendency to recreate images from the training set. To solve both problems, we propose a method that coaxes the sampled trajectories of pretrained diffusion models to land on images that fall outside of a reference set. We achieve this by adding repellency terms to the diffusion SDE throughout the generation trajectory, which are triggered whenever the path is expected to land too closely to an image in the shielded reference set. Our method is sparse in the sense that these repellency terms are zero and inactive most of the time, and even more so towards the end of the generation trajectory. Our method, named SPELL for sparse repellency, can be used either with a static reference set that contains protected images, or dynamically, by updating the set at each timestep with the expected images concurrently generated within a batch, and with the images of previously generated batches. We show that adding SPELL to popular diffusion models improves their diversity while impacting their FID only marginally, and performs comparatively better than other recent training-free diversity methods. We also demonstrate how SPELL can ensure a shielded generation away from a very large set of protected images by considering all 1.2M images from ImageNet as the protected set.</description>

      <title>Privacy for Free in the Overparameterized Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD) is a popular algorithm to train deep learning models with provable guarantees on the privacy of the training data. In the last decade, the problem of understanding its performance cost with respect to standard GD has received remarkable attention from the research community, which formally derived upper bounds on the excess population risk $R_{P}$ in different learning settings. However, existing bounds typically degrade with over-parameterization, i.e., as the number of parameters $p$ gets larger than the number of training samples $n$ -- a regime which is ubiquitous in current deep-learning practice. As a result, the lack of theoretical insights leaves practitioners without clear guidance, leading some to reduce the effective number of trainable parameters to improve performance, while others use larger models to achieve better results through scale. In this work, we show that in the popular random features model with quadratic loss, for any sufficiently large $p$, privacy can be obtained for free, i.e., $\left|R_{P} \right| = o(1)$, not only when the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$ has constant order, but also in the strongly private setting $\varepsilon = o(1)$. This challenges the common wisdom that over-parameterization inherently hinders performance in private learning.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Solving FBSDEs and their Associated Semilinear Elliptic PDEs with Small Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forward-backwards stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) play an important role in optimal control, game theory, economics, mathematical finance, and in reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, the available FBSDE solvers operate on \textit{individual} FBSDEs, meaning that they cannot provide a computationally feasible strategy for solving large families of FBSDEs, as these solvers must be re-run several times. \textit{Neural operators} (NOs) offer an alternative approach for \textit{simultaneously solving} large families of decoupled FBSDEs by directly approximating the solution operator mapping \textit{inputs:} terminal conditions and dynamics of the backwards process to \textit{outputs:} solutions to the associated FBSDE. Though universal approximation theorems (UATs) guarantee the existence of such NOs, these NOs are unrealistically large. Upon making only a few simple theoretically-guided tweaks to the standard convolutional NO build, we confirm that ``small'' NOs can uniformly approximate the solution operator to structured families of FBSDEs with random terminal time, uniformly on suitable compact sets determined by Sobolev norms using a logarithmic depth, a constant width, and a polynomial rank in the reciprocal approximation error.
  This result is rooted in our second result, and main contribution to the NOs for PDE literature, showing that our convolutional NOs of similar depth and width but grow only \textit{quadratically} (at a dimension-free rate) when uniformly approximating the solution operator of the associated class of semilinear Elliptic PDEs to these families of FBSDEs. A key insight into how NOs work we uncover is that the convolutional layers of our NO can approximately implement the fixed point iteration used to prove the existence of a unique solution to these semilinear Elliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>A Novel Characterization of the Population Area Under the Risk Coverage Curve (AURC) and Rates of Finite Sample Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selective classifier (SC) has been proposed for rank based uncertainty thresholding, which could have applications in safety critical areas such as medical diagnostics, autonomous driving, and the justice system. The Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC) has emerged as the foremost evaluation metric for assessing the performance of SC systems. In this work, we present a formal statistical formulation of population AURC, presenting an equivalent expression that can be interpreted as a reweighted risk function. Through Monte Carlo methods, we derive empirical AURC plug-in estimators for finite sample scenarios. The weight estimators associated with these plug-in estimators are shown to be consistent, with low bias and tightly bounded mean squared error (MSE). The plug-in estimators are proven to converge at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\ln(n)/n})$ demonstrating statistical consistency. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our estimators through experiments across multiple datasets, model architectures, and confidence score functions (CSFs), demonstrating consistency and effectiveness in fine-tuning AURC performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of Temporal Difference (TD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging, arguably one of the most widely used algorithms in reinforcement learning, for the task of estimating the parameters of the optimal linear approximation to the value function. We make three significant contributions that improve the current state-of-the-art results: (i) we derive sharper high probability convergence guarantee that depend explicitly on the asymptotic variance and hold under weaker conditions than those normally assumed; (ii) we establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets, achieving faster rates than those previously established in the literature, and (iii) we propose and analyze a novel, computationally efficient online plug-in estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix.These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function approximation, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation of Mean-Field Models via Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of transformers to approximate the mean-field dynamics of interacting particle systems exhibiting collective behavior. Such systems are fundamental in modeling phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, including opinion formation, biological networks, and swarm robotics. The key characteristic of these systems is that the particles are indistinguishable, leading to permutation-equivariant dynamics. First, we empirically demonstrate that transformers are well-suited for approximating a variety of mean field models, including the Cucker-Smale model for flocking and milling, and the mean-field system for training two-layer neural networks. We validate our numerical experiments via mathematical theory. Specifically, we prove that if a finite-dimensional transformer effectively approximates the finite-dimensional vector field governing the particle system, then the $L_2$ distance between the \textit{expected transformer} and the infinite-dimensional mean-field vector field can be uniformly bounded by a function of the number of particles observed during training. Leveraging this result, we establish theoretical bounds on the distance between the true mean-field dynamics and those obtained using the transformer.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Approximation Approach for Efficient Decentralized Optimization on Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A challenging problem in decentralized optimization is to develop algorithms with fast convergence on random and time varying topologies under unreliable and bandwidth-constrained communication network. This paper studies a stochastic approximation approach with a Fully Stochastic Primal Dual Algorithm (FSPDA) framework. Our framework relies on a novel observation that randomness in time varying topology can be incorporated in a stochastic augmented Lagrangian formulation, whose expected value admits saddle points that coincide with stationary solutions of the decentralized optimization problem. With the FSPDA framework, we develop two new algorithms supporting efficient sparsified communication on random time varying topologies -- FSPDA-SA allows agents to execute multiple local gradient steps depending on the time varying topology to accelerate convergence, and FSPDA-STORM further incorporates a variance reduction step to improve sample complexity. For problems with smooth (possibly non-convex) objective function, within $T$ iterations, we show that FSPDA-SA (resp. FSPDA-STORM) finds an $\mathcal{O}( 1/\sqrt{T} )$-stationary (resp. $\mathcal{O}( 1/T^{2/3} )$) solution. Numerical experiments show the benefits of the FSPDA algorithms.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models as Cartoonists: The Curious Case of High Density Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01293v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate what kind of images lie in the high-density regions of diffusion models. We introduce a theoretical mode-tracking process capable of pinpointing the exact mode of the denoising distribution, and we propose a practical high-density sampler that consistently generates images of higher likelihood than usual samplers. Our empirical findings reveal the existence of significantly higher likelihood samples that typical samplers do not produce, often manifesting as cartoon-like drawings or blurry images depending on the noise level. Curiously, these patterns emerge in datasets devoid of such examples. We also present a novel approach to track sample likelihoods in diffusion SDEs, which remarkably incurs no additional computational cost.

      <title>Dual-Head Knowledge Distillation: Enhancing Logits Utilization with an Auxiliary Head</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional knowledge distillation focuses on aligning the student's predicted probabilities with both ground-truth labels and the teacher's predicted probabilities. However, the transition to predicted probabilities from logits would obscure certain indispensable information. To address this issue, it is intuitive to additionally introduce a logit-level loss function as a supplement to the widely used probability-level loss function, for exploiting the latent information of logits. Unfortunately, we empirically find that the amalgamation of the newly introduced logit-level loss and the previous probability-level loss will lead to performance degeneration, even trailing behind the performance of employing either loss in isolation. We attribute this phenomenon to the collapse of the classification head, which is verified by our theoretical analysis based on the neural collapse theory. Specifically, the gradients of the two loss functions exhibit contradictions in the linear classifier yet display no such conflict within the backbone. Drawing from the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel method called dual-head knowledge distillation, which partitions the linear classifier into two classification heads responsible for different losses, thereby preserving the beneficial effects of both losses on the backbone while eliminating adverse influences on the classification head. Extensive experiments validate that our method can effectively exploit the information inside the logits and achieve superior performance against state-of-the-art counterparts.

      <title>LL\"aMmlein: Compact and Competitive German-Only Language Models from Scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11171v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We create two German-only decoder models, LL\"aMmlein 120M and 1B, transparently from scratch and publish them, along with the training data, for the German NLP research community to use. The model training involved several key steps, including extensive data preprocessing, the creation of a custom German tokenizer, the training itself, as well as the evaluation of the final models on various benchmarks. Throughout the training process, multiple checkpoints were saved and analyzed using the SuperGLEBer benchmark to monitor the models' learning dynamics. Compared to state-of-the-art models on the SuperGLEBer benchmark, both LL\"aMmlein models performed competitively, consistently matching or surpassing models with similar parameter sizes. The results show that the models' quality scales with size as expected, but performance improvements on some tasks plateaued early, offering valuable insights into resource allocation for future model development.</description>

      <title>Sample Efficient Robot Learning in Supervised Effect Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In self-supervised robotic learning, agents acquire data through active interaction with their environment, incurring costs such as energy use, human oversight, and experimental time. To mitigate these, sample-efficient exploration is essential. While intrinsic motivation (IM) methods like learning progress (LP) are widely used in robotics, and active learning (AL) is well established for classification in machine learning, few frameworks address continuous, high-dimensional regression tasks typical of world model learning. We propose MUSEL (Model Uncertainty for Sample-Efficient Learning), a novel AL framework tailored for regression tasks in robotics, such as action-effect prediction. MUSEL introduces a model uncertainty metric that combines total predictive uncertainty, learning progress, and input diversity to guide data acquisition. We validate our approach using a Stochastic Variational Deep Kernel Learning (SVDKL) model in two robotic tabletop tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MUSEL improves both learning accuracy and sample efficiency, validating its effectiveness in learning action effects and selecting informative samples.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Mono-to-Binaural Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ZeroBAS, a neural method to synthesize binaural audio from monaural audio recordings and positional information without training on any binaural data. To our knowledge, this is the first published zero-shot neural approach to mono-to-binaural audio synthesis. Specifically, we show that a parameter-free geometric time warping and amplitude scaling based on source location suffices to get an initial binaural synthesis that can be refined by iteratively applying a pretrained denoising vocoder. Furthermore, we find this leads to generalization across room conditions, which we measure by introducing a new dataset, TUT Mono-to-Binaural, to evaluate state-of-the-art monaural-to-binaural synthesis methods on unseen conditions. Our zero-shot method is perceptually on-par with the performance of supervised methods on the standard mono-to-binaural dataset, and even surpasses them on our out-of-distribution TUT Mono-to-Binaural dataset. Our results highlight the potential of pretrained generative audio models and zero-shot learning to unlock robust binaural audio synthesis.</description>

      <title>Preference Adaptive and Sequential Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of interactive text-to-image (T2I) generation, designing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent which iteratively improves a set of generated images for a user through a sequence of prompt expansions. Using human raters, we create a novel dataset of sequential preferences, which we leverage, together with large-scale open-source (non-sequential) datasets. We construct user-preference and user-choice models using an EM strategy and identify varying user preference types. We then leverage a large multimodal language model (LMM) and a value-based RL approach to suggest an adaptive and diverse slate of prompt expansions to the user. Our Preference Adaptive and Sequential Text-to-image Agent (PASTA) extends T2I models with adaptive multi-turn capabilities, fostering collaborative co-creation and addressing uncertainty or underspecification in a user's intent. We evaluate PASTA using human raters, showing significant improvement compared to baseline methods. We also open-source our sequential rater dataset and simulated user-rater interactions to support future research in user-centric multi-turn T2I systems.</description>

      <title>Core Context Aware Transformers for Long Context Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable success in extensive tasks primarily attributed to self-attention mechanism, which requires a token to consider all preceding tokens as its context to compute attention. However, when the context length L becomes very large (e.g., 128K), the amount of potentially redundant information in the context tends to increase. The redundant context not only hampers the modeling representation performance but also incurs unnecessary computational and storage overhead. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play Core Context Aware (CCA) Attention for efficient long-context modeling, comprising two complementary modules: 1) Globality-aware pooling module groups input tokens and dynamically compresses each group into one core token based on their significance. In this way, our method automatically focuses and strengthens core context while diminishing redundancy during the learning process, leading to effective long-term dependency modeling. 2) Locality-preserving module incorporates neighboring tokens to preserve local context for detailed representation. Notably, our CCA-Attention is able to replace the self-attention module in existing LLMs with minimal fine-tuning cost. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our method in both long-context modeling and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>How to Synthesize Text Data without Model Collapse?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model collapse in synthetic data indicates that iterative training on self-generated data leads to a gradual decline in performance. With the proliferation of AI models, synthetic data will fundamentally reshape the web data ecosystem. Future GPT-$\{n\}$ models will inevitably be trained on a blend of synthetic and human-produced data. In this paper, we focus on two questions: what is the impact of synthetic data on language model training, and how to synthesize data without model collapse? We first pre-train language models across different proportions of synthetic data, revealing a negative correlation between the proportion of synthetic data and model performance. We further conduct statistical analysis on synthetic data to uncover distributional shift phenomenon and over-concentration of n-gram features. Inspired by the above findings, we propose token editing on human-produced data to obtain semi-synthetic data. As a proof of concept, we theoretically demonstrate that token-level editing can prevent model collapse, as the test error is constrained by a finite upper bound. We conduct extensive experiments on pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning. The results validate our theoretical proof that token-level editing improves model performance.</description>

      <title>Revisiting In-Context Learning with Long Context Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is a technique by which language models make predictions based on examples provided in their input context. Previously, their context window size imposed a limit on the number of examples that can be shown, making example selection techniques crucial for identifying the maximally effective set of examples. However, the recent advent of Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) has significantly increased the number of examples that can be included in context, raising an important question of whether ICL performance in a many-shot regime is still sensitive to the method of sample selection. To answer this, we revisit these approaches in the context of LCLMs through extensive experiments on 18 datasets spanning 4 tasks. Surprisingly, we observe that sophisticated example selection techniques do not yield significant improvements over a simple random sample selection method. Instead, we discover that the advent of LCLMs has fundamentally shifted the challenge of ICL from that of selecting the most effective examples to that of collecting sufficient examples to fill the context window. Specifically, in certain datasets, including all available examples does not fully utilize the context window; however, by augmenting the examples in context with a simple data augmentation approach, we substantially improve ICL performance by 5%.</description>

      <title>Quantum framework for Reinforcement Learning: Integrating Markov decision process, quantum arithmetic, and trajectory search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum framework for addressing reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, grounded in the quantum principles and leveraging a fully quantum model of the classical Markov decision process (MDP). By employing quantum concepts and a quantum search algorithm, this work presents the implementation and optimization of the agent-environment interactions entirely within the quantum domain, eliminating reliance on classical computations. Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes to the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</description>

      <title>Outlier-Robust Linear System Identification Under Heavy-tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the state transition matrix of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, given access to multiple independent trajectories sampled from the system. Several recent papers have conducted a non-asymptotic analysis of this problem, relying crucially on the assumption that the process noise is either Gaussian or sub-Gaussian, i.e., "light-tailed". In sharp contrast, we work under a significantly weaker noise model, assuming nothing more than the existence of the fourth moment of the noise distribution. For this setting, we provide the first set of results demonstrating that one can obtain sample-complexity bounds for linear system identification that are nearly of the same order as under sub-Gaussian noise. To achieve such results, we develop a novel robust system identification algorithm that relies on constructing multiple weakly-concentrated estimators, and then boosting their performance using suitable tools from high-dimensional robust statistics. Interestingly, our analysis reveals how the kurtosis of the noise distribution, a measure of heavy-tailedness, affects the number of trajectories needed to achieve desired estimation error bounds. Finally, we show that our algorithm and analysis technique can be easily extended to account for scenarios where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a small fraction of the collected trajectory data. Our work takes the first steps towards building a robust statistical learning theory for control under non-ideal assumptions on the data-generating process.</description>

      <title>FitCF: A Framework for Automatic Feature Importance-guided Counterfactual Example Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual examples are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) as valuable data to improve models, and in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to understand model behavior. The automated generation of counterfactual examples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a strong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and the quality of generated counterfactuals, which we hope will serve as an important finding for future research in this direction.</description>

      <title>PRMBench: A Fine-grained and Challenging Benchmark for Process-Level Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03124v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks, where each intermediate step plays an important role in the reasoning process. Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research. We hope PRMBench can be a robust bench for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Adversarial Post-Training for One-Step Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Kimi k1.5: Scaling Reinforcement Learning with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).</description>

      <title>Domaino1s: Guiding LLM Reasoning for Explainable Answers in High-Stakes Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied to downstream domains. However, current LLMs for high-stakes domain tasks, such as financial investment and legal QA, typically generate brief answers without reasoning processes and explanations. This limits users' confidence in making decisions based on their responses. While original CoT shows promise, it lacks self-correction mechanisms during reasoning. This work introduces Domain$o1$s, which enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search. We construct CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k datasets for fine-tuning models that activate domain-specific reasoning steps based on their judgment. Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer assessment dimensions. Extensive experiments on stock investment recommendation and legal reasoning QA tasks demonstrate Domaino1s's leading performance and explainability.

      <title>Random Feature Representation Boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Random Feature Representation Boosting (RFRBoost), a novel method for constructing deep residual random feature neural networks (RFNNs) using boosting theory. RFRBoost uses random features at each layer to learn the functional gradient of the network representation, enhancing performance while preserving the convex optimization benefits of RFNNs. In the case of MSE loss, we obtain closed-form solutions to greedy layer-wise boosting with random features. For general loss functions, we show that fitting random feature residual blocks reduces to solving a quadratically constrained least squares problem. Through extensive numerical experiments on tabular datasets for both regression and classification, we show that RFRBoost significantly outperforms RFNNs and end-to-end trained MLP ResNets in the small- to medium-scale regime where RFNNs are typically applied. Moreover, RFRBoost offers substantial computational benefits, and theoretical guarantees stemming from boosting theory.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Heterogeneous Token Overfitting in LLM Knowledge Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various natural language tasks. However, they are trained on static corpora and their knowledge can become outdated quickly in the fast-changing world. This motivates the development of knowledge editing (KE) to update specific knowledge in LLMs without changing unrelated others or compromising their pre-trained capabilities. Previous efforts sought to update a small amount of parameters of a LLM and proved effective for making selective updates. Nonetheless, the edited LLM often exhibits degraded ability to reason about the new knowledge. In this work, we identify a key issue: heterogeneous token overfitting (HTO), where the LLM overfits different tokens in the provided knowledge at varying rates. To tackle this, we propose OVERTONE, a token-level smoothing method that mitigates HTO by adaptively refining the target distribution. Theoretically, OVERTONE offers better parameter updates with negligible computation overhead. It also induces an implicit DPO but does not require preference data pairs. Extensive experiments across four editing methods, two LLMs, and diverse scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.</description>

      <title>LoRA-One: One-Step Full Gradient Could Suffice for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models, Provably and Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores how theory can guide and enhance practical algorithms, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA, Hu et al. 2022) in large language models as a case study. We rigorously prove that, under gradient descent, LoRA adapters align with specific singular subspaces of the one-step full fine-tuning gradient. This result suggests that, by properly initializing the adapters using the one-step full gradient, subspace alignment can be achieved immediately and applicable to both linear and nonlinear models. Building on our theory, we propose a theory-driven algorithm, LoRA-One, where the linear convergence (as well as generalization) is built and incorporating preconditioners theoretically helps mitigate the effects of ill-conditioning. Besides, our theory reveals connections between LoRA-One and other gradient-alignment-based methods, helping to clarify misconceptions in the design of such algorithms. LoRA-One achieves significant empirical improvements over LoRA and its variants across benchmarks in natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and code generation.

      <title>Spurious Correlations in High Dimensional Regression: The Roles of Regularization, Simplicity Bias and Over-Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning models have been shown to rely on spurious correlations between non-predictive features and the associated labels in the training data, with negative implications on robustness, bias and fairness. In this work, we provide a statistical characterization of this phenomenon for high-dimensional regression, when the data contains a predictive core feature $x$ and a spurious feature $y$. Specifically, we quantify the amount of spurious correlations $C$ learned via linear regression, in terms of the data covariance and the strength $\lambda$ of the ridge regularization. As a consequence, we first capture the simplicity of $y$ through the spectrum of its covariance, and its correlation with $x$ through the Schur complement of the full data covariance. Next, we prove a trade-off between $C$ and the in-distribution test loss $L$, by showing that the value of $\lambda$ that minimizes $L$ lies in an interval where $C$ is increasing. Finally, we investigate the effects of over-parameterization via the random features model, by showing its equivalence to regularized linear regression. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments on Gaussian, Color-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.</description>

      <title>LV-XAttn: Distributed Cross-Attention for Long Visual Inputs in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-attention is commonly adopted in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual information into the language backbone. However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs, the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique to support longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with Llama 3-V, mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 10.62$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>From Kernels to Features: A Multi-Scale Adaptive Theory of Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature learning in neural networks is crucial for their expressive power and inductive biases, motivating various theoretical approaches. Some approaches describe network behavior after training through a change in kernel scale from initialization, resulting in a generalization power comparable to a Gaussian process. Conversely, in other approaches training results in the adaptation of the kernel to the data, involving directional changes to the kernel. The relationship and respective strengths of these two views have so far remained unresolved. This work presents a theoretical framework of multi-scale adaptive feature learning bridging these two views. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we derive analytical expressions for network output statistics which are valid across scaling regimes and in the continuum between them. A systematic expansion of the network's probability distribution reveals that mean-field scaling requires only a saddle-point approximation, while standard scaling necessitates additional correction terms. Remarkably, we find across regimes that kernel adaptation can be reduced to an effective kernel rescaling when predicting the mean network output in the special case of a linear network. However, for linear and non-linear networks, the multi-scale adaptive approach captures directional feature learning effects, providing richer insights than what could be recovered from a rescaling of the kernel alone.</description>

      <title>Beyond External Monitors: Enhancing Transparency of Large Language Models for Easier Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable, but the mechanisms of their thinking and decision-making process remain unclear. Chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) have been commonly utilized to monitor LLMs, but this strategy fails to accurately reflect LLMs' thinking process. Techniques based on LLMs' hidden representations provide an inner perspective to monitor their latent thinking. However, previous methods only try to develop external monitors instead of making LLMs themselves easier to monitor. In this paper, we propose a novel method TELLME, improving the transparency of LLMs and helping monitors identify unsuitable and sensitive behaviors. Furthermore, we showcase the applications of TELLME on trustworthiness tasks (\eg, safety risks monitoring tasks and detoxification tasks), where LLMs achieve consistent improvement in transparency and task performance. More crucially, we theoretically analyze the improvement of TELLME on LLMs' generalization ability through optimal transport theory.</description>

      <title>Smooth Sailing: Lipschitz-Driven Uncertainty Quantification for Spatial Association</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating associations between spatial covariates and responses - rather than merely predicting responses - is central to environmental science, epidemiology, and economics. For instance, public health officials might be interested in whether air pollution has a strictly positive association with a health outcome, and the magnitude of any effect. Standard machine learning methods often provide accurate predictions but offer limited insight into covariate-response relationships. And we show that existing methods for constructing confidence (or credible) intervals for associations fail to provide nominal coverage in the face of model misspecification and distribution shift - despite both being essentially always present in spatial problems. We introduce a method that constructs valid frequentist confidence intervals for associations in spatial settings. Our method requires minimal assumptions beyond a form of spatial smoothness. In particular, we do not require model correctness or covariate overlap between training and target locations. Our approach is the first to guarantee nominal coverage in this setting and outperforms existing techniques in both real and simulated experiments.</description>

      <title>LongReD: Mitigating Short-Text Degradation of Long-Context Large Language Models via Restoration Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained extended context windows through scaling positional encodings and lightweight continual pre-training. However, this often leads to degraded performance on short-text tasks, while the reasons for this degradation remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we identify two primary factors contributing to this issue: distribution drift in hidden states and attention scores, and catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose Long Context Pre-training with Restoration Distillation (LongReD), a novel approach designed to mitigate short-text performance degradation through minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the extended and original models. Besides training on long texts, LongReD distills the hidden state of selected layers from the original model on short texts. Additionally, LongReD also introduces a short-to-long distillation, aligning the output distribution on short texts with that on long texts by leveraging skipped positional indices. Experiments on common text benchmarks demonstrate that LongReD effectively preserves the model's short-text performance while maintaining comparable or even better capacity to handle long texts than baselines.

      <title>Combinatorial Reinforcement Learning with Preference Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider combinatorial reinforcement learning with preference feedback, where a learning agent sequentially offers an action--an assortment of multiple items to--a user, whose preference feedback follows a multinomial logistic (MNL) model. This framework allows us to model real-world scenarios, particularly those involving long-term user engagement, such as in recommender systems and online advertising. However, this framework faces two main challenges: (1) the unknown value of each item, unlike traditional MNL bandits that only address single-step preference feedback, and (2) the difficulty of ensuring optimism while maintaining tractable assortment selection in the combinatorial action space with unknown values. In this paper, we assume a contextual MNL preference model, where the mean utilities are linear, and the value of each item is approximated by a general function. We propose an algorithm, MNL-VQL, that addresses these challenges, making it both computationally and statistically efficient. As a special case, for linear MDPs (with the MNL preference feedback), we establish the first regret lower bound in this framework and show that MNL-VQL achieves nearly minimax-optimal regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide statistical guarantees in combinatorial RL with preference feedback.</description>

      <title>ReLearn: Unlearning via Learning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current unlearning methods for large language models usually rely on reverse optimization to reduce target token probabilities. However, this paradigm disrupts the subsequent tokens prediction, degrading model performance and linguistic coherence. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics overemphasize contextual forgetting while inadequately assessing response fluency and relevance. To address these challenges, we propose ReLearn, a data augmentation and fine-tuning pipeline for effective unlearning, along with a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework introduces Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR) and Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR) to measure knowledge-level preservation, and Linguistic Score (LS) to evaluate generation quality. Our experiments show that ReLearn successfully achieves targeted forgetting while preserving high-quality output. Through mechanistic analysis, we further demonstrate how reverse optimization disrupts coherent text generation, while ReLearn preserves this essential capability.

      <title>Leveraging Dual Process Theory in Language Agent Framework for Real-time Simultaneous Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11882v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</description>

      <title>ThinkGuard: Deliberative Slow Thinking Leads to Cautious Guardrails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical as they are deployed in real-world applications. Existing guardrails rely on rule-based filtering or single-pass classification, limiting their ability to handle nuanced safety violations. To address this, we propose ThinkGuard, a critique-augmented guardrail model that distills knowledge from high-capacity LLMs by generating structured critiques alongside safety labels. Fine-tuned on critique-augmented data, the captured deliberative thinking ability drastically enhances the guardrail's cautiousness and interpretability. Evaluated on multiple safety benchmarks, ThinkGuard achieves the highest average F1 and AUPRC, outperforming all baselines. Compared to LLaMA Guard 3, ThinkGuard improves accuracy by 16.1% and macro F1 by 27.0%. Moreover, it surpasses label-only fine-tuned models, confirming that structured critiques enhance both classification precision and nuanced safety reasoning while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optimize Cardinality Estimation Model Pretraining by Simplifying the Training Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cardinality estimation is a key aspect of query optimization research, and its performance has significantly improved with the integration of machine learning. To overcome the "cold start" problem or the lack of model transferability in learned cardinality estimators, some pre-training cardinality estimation models have been proposed that use learning across multiple datasets and corresponding workloads. These models typically train on a dataset created by uniformly sampling from many datasets, but this approach may not be optimal. By applying the Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (Group DRO) algorithm to training datasets, we find that some specific training datasets contribute more significantly to model performance than others. Based on this observation, we conduct extensive experiments to delve deeper into pre-training cardinality estimators. Our results show how the performance of these models can be influenced by the datasets and corresponding workloads. Finally, we introduce a simplified training dataset, which has been reduced to a fraction of the size of existing pretraining datasets. Sufficient experimental results demonstrate that the pre-trained cardinality estimator based on this simplified dataset can still achieve comparable performance to existing models in zero-shot setups.</description>

      <title>Robustness and Cybersecurity in the EU Artificial Intelligence Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) establishes different legal principles for different types of AI systems. While prior work has sought to clarify some of these principles, little attention has been paid to robustness and cybersecurity. This paper aims to fill this gap. We identify legal challenges and shortcomings in provisions related to robustness and cybersecurity for high-risk AI systems(Art. 15 AIA) and general-purpose AI models (Art. 55 AIA). We show that robustness and cybersecurity demand resilience against performance disruptions. Furthermore, we assess potential challenges in implementing these provisions in light of recent advancements in the machine learning (ML) literature. Our analysis informs efforts to develop harmonized standards, guidelines by the European Commission, as well as benchmarks and measurement methodologies under Art. 15(2) AIA. With this, we seek to bridge the gap between legal terminology and ML research, fostering a better alignment between research and implementation efforts.</description>

      <title>Interpreting CLIP with Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are useful for detecting and steering interpretable features in neural networks, with particular potential for understanding complex multimodal representations. Given their ability to uncover interpretable features, SAEs are particularly valuable for analyzing large-scale vision-language models (e.g., CLIP and SigLIP), which are fundamental building blocks in modern systems yet remain challenging to interpret and control. However, current SAE methods are limited by optimizing both reconstruction quality and sparsity simultaneously, as they rely on either activation suppression or rigid sparsity constraints. To this end, we introduce Matryoshka SAE (MSAE), a new architecture that learns hierarchical representations at multiple granularities simultaneously, enabling a direct optimization of both metrics without compromise. MSAE establishes a new state-of-the-art Pareto frontier between reconstruction quality and sparsity for CLIP, achieving 0.99 cosine similarity and less than 0.1 fraction of variance unexplained while maintaining ~80% sparsity. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of MSAE as a tool for interpreting and controlling CLIP by extracting over 120 semantic concepts from its representation to perform concept-based similarity search and bias analysis in downstream tasks like CelebA. We make the codebase available at https://github.com/WolodjaZ/MSAE.</description>

      <title>Learning to Steer Learners in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to exploit learning algorithms through repeated interactions in games. Specifically, we focus on the case of repeated two player, finite-action games, in which an optimizer aims to steer a no-regret learner to a Stackelberg equilibrium without knowledge of its payoffs. We first show that this is impossible if the optimizer only knows that the learner is using an algorithm from the general class of no-regret algorithms. This suggests that the optimizer requires more information about the learner's objectives or algorithm to successfully exploit them. Building on this intuition, we reduce the problem for the optimizer to that of recovering the learner's payoff structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach if the learner's algorithm is drawn from a smaller class by analyzing two examples: one where the learner uses an ascent algorithm, and another where the learner uses stochastic mirror ascent with known regularizer and step sizes.</description>

      <title>Position: Don't Use the CLT in LLM Evals With Fewer Than a Few Hundred Datapoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rigorous statistical evaluations of large language models (LLMs), including valid error bars and significance testing, are essential for meaningful and reliable performance assessment. Currently, when such statistical measures are reported, they typically rely on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). In this position paper, we argue that while CLT-based methods for uncertainty quantification are appropriate when benchmarks consist of thousands of examples, they fail to provide adequate uncertainty estimates for LLM evaluations that rely on smaller, highly specialized benchmarks. In these small-data settings, we demonstrate that CLT-based methods perform very poorly, usually dramatically underestimating uncertainty (i.e. producing error bars that are too small). We give recommendations for alternative frequentist and Bayesian methods that are both easy to implement and more appropriate in these increasingly common scenarios. We provide a simple Python library for these Bayesian methods at https://github.com/sambowyer/bayes_evals .</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Reasoning with LLMs for k-anonymity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.</description>

      <title>Constrained Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a class of generative models that construct sequences by progressively denoising samples from a categorical noise distribution. Beyond their rapidly growing ability to generate coherent natural language, these models present a new and important opportunity to enforce sequence-level constraints, a capability that current autoregressive models cannot natively provide. This paper capitalizes on this opportunity by introducing Constrained Discrete Diffusion (CDD), a novel integration of differentiable constraint optimization within the diffusion process to ensure adherence to constraints, logic rules, or safety requirements for generated sequences. Unlike conventional text generators that often rely on post-hoc filtering or model retraining for controllable generation, CDD directly imposes constraints into the discrete diffusion sampling process, resulting in a training-free and effective approach. Experiments in toxicity-controlled text generation, property-constrained molecule design, and instruction-constrained text completion demonstrate that CDD achieves zero constraint violations in a diverse array of tasks while preserving fluency, novelty, and coherence while outperforming autoregressive and existing discrete diffusion approaches.</description>

      <title>Light-R1: Curriculum SFT, DPO and RL for Long COT from Scratch and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10460v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Light-R1, an open-source suite for training long reasoning models using reproducible and cost-effective methodology. Given the proprietary nature of data used in the DeepSeek-R1 series, we develop an alternative approach leveraging exclusively public data and models. Our curriculum training progressively increases data difficulty, combined with multi-staged post-training. Our Light-R1-32B model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B in math reasoning.
  Experimental results show that this curriculum approach becomes more effective when distinct, diverse datasets are available for different training stages: fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distilled models (pre-tuned by DeepSeek team on proprietary data) with 3,000 challenging examples from our curriculum dataset yielded state-of-the-art 7B and 14B models, while the 32B model, Light-R1-32B-DS performed comparably to QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1.
  Furthermore, we extend our work by applying GRPO on long reasoning models. Our final Light-R1-14B-DS achieves SOTA performance among 14B models in math, with AIME24 &amp; 25 scores of 74.0 and 60.2 respectively, surpassing many 32B models and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Despite math-focused training, Light-R1-14B-DS demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization.
  Light-R1 represents a significant advancement in making sophisticated reasoning models more accessible and implementable in real-world applications. Our models, training data and code have been made available at https://github.com/Qihoo360/Light-R1.</description>

      <title>Towards Resilient and Sustainable Global Industrial Systems: An Evolutionary-Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new complex optimization problem in the field of automatic design of advanced industrial systems and proposes a hybrid optimization approach to solve the problem. The problem is multi-objective as it aims at finding solutions that minimize CO2 emissions, transportation time, and costs. The optimization approach combines an evolutionary algorithm and classical mathematical programming to design resilient and sustainable global manufacturing networks. Further, it makes use of the OWL ontology for data consistency and constraint management. The experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in both single and double sourcing scenarios. The proposed methodology, in general, can be applied to any industry case with complex manufacturing and supply chain challenges.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Generation and Rollover Budget Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19385v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</description>

      <title>ORIGEN: Zero-Shot 3D Orientation Grounding in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ORIGEN, the first zero-shot method for 3D orientation grounding in text-to-image generation across multiple objects and diverse categories. While previous work on spatial grounding in image generation has mainly focused on 2D positioning, it lacks control over 3D orientation. To address this, we propose a reward-guided sampling approach using a pretrained discriminative model for 3D orientation estimation and a one-step text-to-image generative flow model. While gradient-ascent-based optimization is a natural choice for reward-based guidance, it struggles to maintain image realism. Instead, we adopt a sampling-based approach using Langevin dynamics, which extends gradient ascent by simply injecting random noise--requiring just a single additional line of code. Additionally, we introduce adaptive time rescaling based on the reward function to accelerate convergence. Our experiments show that ORIGEN outperforms both training-based and test-time guidance methods across quantitative metrics and user studies.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Compact LLMs for Zero-Shot Iberian Language Tasks on End-User Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have significantly advanced natural language processing, achieving remarkable performance in tasks such as language generation, translation, and reasoning. However, their substantial computational requirements restrict deployment to high-end systems, limiting accessibility on consumer-grade devices. This challenge is especially pronounced for under-resourced languages like those spoken in the Iberian Peninsula, where relatively limited linguistic resources and benchmarks hinder effective evaluation. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of compact state-of-the-art LLMs across several essential NLP tasks tailored for Iberian languages. The results reveal that while some models consistently excel in certain tasks, significant performance gaps remain, particularly for languages such as Basque. These findings highlight the need for further research on balancing model compactness with robust multilingual performance</description>

      <title>SynWorld: Virtual Scenario Synthesis for Agentic Action Knowledge Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the interaction between agents and their environments, agents expand their capabilities by planning and executing actions. However, LLM-based agents face substantial challenges when deployed in novel environments or required to navigate unconventional action spaces. To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/SynWorld.</description>

      <title>Domain-Specific Pruning of Large Mixture-of-Experts Models with Few-shot Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve a favorable trade-off between performance and inference efficiency by activating only a subset of experts. However, the memory overhead of storing all experts remains a major limitation, especially in large-scale MoE models such as DeepSeek-R1(671B). In this study, we investigate domain specialization and expert redundancy in large-scale MoE models and uncover a consistent behavior we term few-shot expert localization, with only a few in-domain demonstrations, the model consistently activates a sparse and stable subset of experts on tasks within the same domain. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective pruning framework, EASY-EP, that leverages a few domain-specific demonstrations to identify and retain only the most relevant experts. EASY-EP comprises two key components: output-aware expert importance assessment and expert-level token contribution estimation. The former evaluates the importance of each expert for the current token by considering the gating scores and L2 norm of the outputs of activated experts, while the latter assesses the contribution of tokens based on representation similarities before and after routed experts. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3-0324 show that our method can achieve comparable performances and $2.99\times$ throughput under the same memory budget with full model with only half the experts.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey in LLM(-Agent) Full Stack Safety: Data, Training and Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.</description>

      <title>Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state-observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. This shortcoming is addressed by approximating the mean-field evolution using a novel form of neural operator taking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. The derivation of methods from a mean-field formulation allows a single parameterization of the algorithm to be deployed at different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.</description>

      <title>Generalization Analysis for Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning under Non-IID Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) has achieved impressive success in various domains in recent years. Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of the generalization behavior of CRL has remained limited. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the current literature only analyzes generalization bounds under the assumption that the data tuples used for contrastive learning are independently and identically distributed. However, in practice, we are often limited to a fixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable to recycle data across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, the tuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated. In this paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under non-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically. Drawing inspiration from the literature on U-statistics, we derive generalization bounds which indicate that the required number of samples in each class scales as the logarithm of the covering number of the class of learnable feature representations associated to that class. Next, we apply our main results to derive excess risk bounds for common function classes such as linear maps and neural networks.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Dimensional Factorization Limits in Discrete Diffusion Models through Quantum Joint Distribution Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores quantum-enhanced discrete diffusion models to overcome classical limitations in learning high-dimensional distributions. We rigorously prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage in joint distribution learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-based spatial cognition is vital for robotics and embodied AI but challenges current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Towards Visuospatial Cognition via Hierarchical Fusion of Visual Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2 (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial reasoning. ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset to facilitate further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive models have become the de facto choice for sequence generation tasks, but standard approaches treat digits as independent tokens and apply cross-entropy loss, overlooking the coherent structure of numerical sequences. This paper introduces Numerical Token Integrity Loss (NTIL) to address this gap. NTIL operates at two levels: (1) token-level, where it extends the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to preserve ordinal relationships between numerical values, and (2) sequence-level, where it penalizes the overall discrepancy between the predicted and actual sequences. This dual approach improves numerical prediction and integrates effectively with LLMs/MLLMs. Extensive experiments show significant performance improvements with NTIL.</description>

      <title>Taming Recommendation Bias with Causal Intervention on Evolving Personal Popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Popularity bias occurs when popular items are recommended far more frequently than they should be, negatively impacting both user experience and recommendation accuracy. Existing debiasing methods mitigate popularity bias often uniformly across all users and only partially consider the time evolution of users or items. However, users have different levels of preference for item popularity, and this preference is evolving over time. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called CausalEPP (Causal Intervention on Evolving Personal Popularity) for taming recommendation bias, which accounts for the evolving personal popularity of users. Specifically, we first introduce a metric called {Evolving Personal Popularity} to quantify each user's preference for popular items. Then, we design a causal graph that integrates evolving personal popularity into the conformity effect, and apply deconfounded training to mitigate the popularity bias of the causal graph. During inference, we consider the evolution consistency between users and items to achieve a better recommendation. Empirical studies demonstrate that CausalEPP outperforms baseline methods in reducing popularity bias while improving recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>BACON: A fully explainable AI model with graded logic for decision making problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models and autonomous agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes, real-world domains such as healthcare, security, finance, and robotics, the need for transparent and trustworthy explanations has become critical. To ensure end-to-end transparency of AI decisions, we need models that are not only accurate but also fully explainable and human-tunable. We introduce BACON, a novel framework for automatically training explainable AI models for decision making problems using graded logic. BACON achieves high predictive accuracy while offering full structural transparency and precise, logic-based symbolic explanations, enabling effective human-AI collaboration and expert-guided refinement. We evaluate BACON with a diverse set of scenarios: classic Boolean approximation, Iris flower classification, house purchasing decisions and breast cancer diagnosis. In each case, BACON provides high-performance models while producing compact, human-verifiable decision logic. These results demonstrate BACON's potential as a practical and principled approach for delivering crisp, trustworthy explainable AI.</description>

      <title>AKRMap: Adaptive Kernel Regression for Trustworthy Visualization of Cross-Modal Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings form the foundation for multi-modal models. However, visualization methods for interpreting cross-modal embeddings have been primarily confined to traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques like PCA and t-SNE. These DR methods primarily focus on feature distributions within a single modality, whilst failing to incorporate metrics (e.g., CLIPScore) across multiple modalities. This paper introduces AKRMap, a new DR technique designed to visualize cross-modal embeddings metric with enhanced accuracy by learning kernel regression of the metric landscape in the projection space. Specifically, AKRMap constructs a supervised projection network guided by a post-projection kernel regression loss, and employs adaptive generalized kernels that can be jointly optimized with the projection. This approach enables AKRMap to efficiently generate visualizations that capture complex metric distributions, while also supporting interactive features such as zoom and overlay for deeper exploration. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that AKRMap outperforms existing DR methods in generating more accurate and trustworthy visualizations. We further showcase the effectiveness of AKRMap in visualizing and comparing cross-modal embeddings for text-to-image models.

      <title>From EduVisBench to EduVisAgent: A Benchmark and Multi-Agent Framework for Reasoning-Driven Pedagogical Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While foundation models (FMs), such as diffusion models and large vision-language models (LVLMs), have been widely applied in educational contexts, their ability to generate pedagogically effective visual explanations remains limited. Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning, overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition, metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2% improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations. EduVisBench and EduVisAgent are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/EduVisBench and https://github.com/aiming-lab/EduVisAgent.</description>

Abstract: The complexity of code reviews has driven efforts to automate review comments, but prior approaches oversimplify this task by treating it as snippet-level code-to-text generation and relying on text similarity metrics like BLEU for evaluation. These methods overlook repository context, real-world merge request evaluation, and defect detection, limiting their practicality. To address these issues, we explore the full automation pipeline within the online recommendation service of a company with nearly 400 million daily active users, analyzing industry-grade C++ codebases comprising hundreds of thousands of lines of code. We identify four key challenges: 1) capturing relevant context, 2) improving key bug inclusion (KBI), 3) reducing false alarm rates (FAR), and 4) integrating human workflows. To tackle these, we propose 1) code slicing algorithms for context extraction, 2) a multi-role LLM framework for KBI, 3) a filtering mechanism for FAR reduction, and 4) a novel prompt design for better human interaction. Our approach, validated on real-world merge requests from historical fault reports, achieves a 2x improvement over standard LLMs and a 10x gain over previous baselines. While the presented results focus on C++, the underlying framework design leverages language-agnostic principles (e.g., AST-based analysis), suggesting potential for broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Feature Interactions from the Perspective of Quadratic Neural Networks for Click-through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadamard Product (HP) has long been a cornerstone in click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and ability to capture feature interactions without additional parameters. However, the underlying reasons for its effectiveness remain unclear. In this paper, we revisit HP from the perspective of Quadratic Neural Networks (QNN), which leverage quadratic interaction terms to model complex feature relationships. We further reveal QNN's ability to expand the feature space and provide smooth nonlinear approximations without relying on activation functions. Meanwhile, we find that traditional post-activation does not further improve the performance of the QNN. Instead, mid-activation is a more suitable alternative. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of 25 QNN neuron formats, we identify a good-performing variant and make further enhancements on it. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Head Khatri-Rao Product as a superior alternative to HP and a Self-Ensemble Loss with dynamic ensemble capability within the same network to enhance computational efficiency and performance. Ultimately, we propose a novel neuron format, QNN-alpha, which is tailored for CTR prediction tasks. Experimental results show that QNN-alpha achieves new state-of-the-art performance on six public datasets while maintaining low inference latency, good scalability, and excellent compatibility.

      <title>A Comprehensive Real-World Assessment of Audio Watermarking Algorithms: Will They Survive Neural Codecs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Robust Audio Watermarking Benchmark (RAW-Bench), a benchmark for evaluating deep learning-based audio watermarking methods with standardized and systematic comparisons. To simulate real-world usage, we introduce a comprehensive audio attack pipeline with various distortions such as compression, background noise, and reverberation, along with a diverse test dataset including speech, environmental sounds, and music recordings. Evaluating four existing watermarking methods on RAW-bench reveals two main insights: (i) neural compression techniques pose the most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such compressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases. Furthermore, we find that specific distortions, such as polarity inversion, time stretching, or reverb, seriously affect certain methods. The evaluation framework is accessible at github.com/SonyResearch/raw_bench.</description>

      <title>ControlTac: Force- and Position-Controlled Tactile Data Augmentation with a Single Reference Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensing has been widely used in perception, reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. However, collecting large-scale tactile data remains costly due to the localized nature of sensor-object interactions and inconsistencies across sensor instances. Existing approaches to scaling tactile data, such as simulation and free-form tactile generation, often suffer from unrealistic output and poor transferability to downstream tasks. To address this, we propose ControlTac, a two-stage controllable framework that generates realistic tactile images conditioned on a single reference tactile image, contact force, and contact position. With those physical priors as control input, ControlTac generates physically plausible and varied tactile images that can be used for effective data augmentation. Through experiments on three downstream tasks, we demonstrate that ControlTac can effectively augment tactile datasets and lead to consistent gains. Our three real-world experiments further validate the practical utility of our approach. Project page: https://dongyuluo.github.io/controltac.</description>

      <title>AstroVisBench: A Code Benchmark for Scientific Computing and Visualization in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for applications in scientific research, including their capabilities to synthesize literature, answer research questions, generate research ideas, and even conduct computational experiments. Ultimately, our goal is for these to help scientists derive novel scientific insights. In many areas of science, such insights often arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However, evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has not been addressed in past work. We introduce AstroVisBench, the first benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy domain. AstroVisBench judges a language model's ability to both (1) create astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the results of these workflows through complex plots. Our evaluation of visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against annotation by five professional astronomers. Using AstroVisBench we present an evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants. This evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows, which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.</description>

      <title>Integrating Intermediate Layer Optimization and Projected Gradient Descent for Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems (IPs) involve reconstructing signals from noisy observations. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving IPs, achieving remarkable reconstruction performance. However, existing DM-based methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work DMPlug, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our approaches under appropriate conditions and validate their superiority through extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.</description>

      <title>Something's Fishy In The Data Lake: A Critical Re-evaluation of Table Union Search Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent table representation learning and data discovery methods tackle table union search (TUS) within data lakes, which involves identifying tables that can be unioned with a given query table to enrich its content. These methods are commonly evaluated using benchmarks that aim to assess semantic understanding in real-world TUS tasks. However, our analysis of prominent TUS benchmarks reveals several limitations that allow simple baselines to perform surprisingly well, often outperforming more sophisticated approaches. This suggests that current benchmark scores are heavily influenced by dataset-specific characteristics and fail to effectively isolate the gains from semantic understanding. To address this, we propose essential criteria for future benchmarks to enable a more realistic and reliable evaluation of progress in semantic table union search.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Automated Perceptual Voice Quality Assessment with Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perceptual voice quality assessment is essential for diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders. Traditionally, expert raters use scales such as the CAPE-V and GRBAS. However, these are subjective and prone to inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated, objective assessment methods. This study proposes VOQANet, a deep learning framework with an attention mechanism that leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to extract high-level acoustic and prosodic information from raw speech. To improve robustness and interpretability, we introduce VOQANet+, which integrates handcrafted acoustic features such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM embeddings into a hybrid representation. Unlike prior work focusing only on vowel-based phonation (PVQD-A subset) from the Perceptual Voice Quality Dataset (PVQD), we evaluate our models on both vowel-based and sentence-level speech (PVQD-S subset) for better generalizability. Results show that sentence-based input outperforms vowel-based input, particularly at the patient level, highlighting the benefit of longer utterances for capturing voice attributes. VOQANet consistently surpasses baseline methods in root mean squared error and Pearson correlation across CAPE-V and GRBAS dimensions, with VOQANet+ achieving further improvements. Additional tests under noisy conditions show that VOQANet+ maintains high prediction accuracy, supporting its use in real-world and telehealth settings. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SFM embeddings with domain-informed acoustic features for interpretable and robust voice quality assessment.</description>

      <title>AgriFM: A Multi-source Temporal Remote Sensing Foundation Model for Crop Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics. Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction, leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations. This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/AgriFM.</description>
