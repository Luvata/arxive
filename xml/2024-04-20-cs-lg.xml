      <title>Exploring DNN Robustness Against Adversarial Attacks Using Approximate Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have advanced in many real-world applications, such as healthcare and autonomous driving. However, their high computational complexity and vulnerability to adversarial attacks are ongoing challenges. In this letter, approximate multipliers are used to explore DNN robustness improvement against adversarial attacks. By uniformly replacing accurate multipliers for state-of-the-art approximate ones in DNN layer models, we explore the DNNs robustness against various adversarial attacks in a feasible time. Results show up to 7% accuracy drop due to approximations when no attack is present while improving robust accuracy up to 10% when attacks applied.</description>

      <title>Deep Dependency Networks and Advanced Inference Schemes for Multi-Label Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework called deep dependency networks (DDNs) that combines dependency networks and deep learning architectures for multi-label classification, with a particular emphasis on image and video data. The primary advantage of dependency networks is their ease of training, in contrast to other probabilistic graphical models like Markov networks. In particular, when combined with deep learning architectures, they provide an intuitive, easy-to-use loss function for multi-label classification. A drawback of DDNs compared to Markov networks is their lack of advanced inference schemes, necessitating the use of Gibbs sampling. To address this challenge, we propose novel inference schemes based on local search and integer linear programming for computing the most likely assignment to the labels given observations. We evaluate our novel methods on three video datasets (Charades, TACoS, Wetlab) and three image datasets (MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE), comparing their performance with (a) basic neural architectures and (b) neural architectures combined with Markov networks equipped with advanced inference and learning techniques. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our new DDN methods over the two competing approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning with 3D rotations, a hitchhiker's guide to SO(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many settings in machine learning require the selection of a rotation representation. However, choosing a suitable representation from the many available options is challenging. This paper acts as a survey and guide through rotation representations. We walk through their properties that harm or benefit deep learning with gradient-based optimization. By consolidating insights from rotation-based learning, we provide a comprehensive overview of learning functions with rotation representations. We provide guidance on selecting representations based on whether rotations are in the model's input or output and whether the data primarily comprises small angles.</description>

      <title>Virtual Foundry Graphnet for Metal Sintering Deformation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal Sintering is a necessary step for Metal Injection Molded parts and binder jet such as HP's metal 3D printer. The metal sintering process introduces large deformation varying from 25 to 50% depending on the green part porosity. In this paper, we use a graph-based deep learning approach to predict the part deformation, which can speed up the deformation simulation substantially at the voxel level. Running a well-trained Metal Sintering inferencing engine only takes a range of seconds to obtain the final sintering deformation value. The tested accuracy on example complex geometry achieves 0.7um mean deviation for a 63mm testing part.</description>

      <title>Improved Generalization Bounds for Communication Efficient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on reducing the communication cost of federated learning by exploring generalization bounds and representation learning. We first characterize a tighter generalization bound for one-round federated learning based on local clients' generalizations and heterogeneity of data distribution (non-iid scenario). We also characterize a generalization bound in R-round federated learning and its relation to the number of local updates (local stochastic gradient descents (SGDs)). Then, based on our generalization bound analysis and our representation learning interpretation of this analysis, we show for the first time that less frequent aggregations, hence more local updates, for the representation extractor (usually corresponds to initial layers) leads to the creation of more generalizable models, particularly for non-iid scenarios. We design a novel Federated Learning with Adaptive Local Steps (FedALS) algorithm based on our generalization bound and representation learning analysis. FedALS employs varying aggregation frequencies for different parts of the model, so reduces the communication cost. The paper is followed with experimental results showing the effectiveness of FedALS.</description>

      <title>Predictive Model Development to Identify Failed Healing in Patients after Non-Union Fracture Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bone non-union is among the most severe complications associated with trauma surgery, occurring in 10-30% of cases after long bone fractures. Treating non-unions requires a high level of surgical expertise and often involves multiple revision surgeries, sometimes even leading to amputation. Thus, more accurate prognosis is crucial for patient well-being. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) hold promise for developing models to predict non-union healing, even when working with smaller datasets, a commonly encountered challenge in clinical domains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ML in identifying candidates at risk of failed non-union healing, we applied three ML models (logistic regression, support vector machine, and XGBoost) to the clinical dataset TRUFFLE, which includes 797 patients with long bone non-union. The models provided prediction results with 70% sensitivity, and the specificities of 66% (XGBoost), 49% (support vector machine), and 43% (logistic regression). These findings offer valuable clinical insights because they enable early identification of patients at risk of failed non-union healing after the initial surgical revision treatment protocol.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Mesh Optimization of a Hybrid Deep Learning Black-Box PDE Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has been widely applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in computational fluid dynamics. Recent research proposed a PDE correction framework that leverages deep learning to correct the solution obtained by a PDE solver on a coarse mesh. However, end-to-end training of such a PDE correction model over both solver-dependent parameters such as mesh parameters and neural network parameters requires the PDE solver to support automatic differentiation through the iterative numerical process. Such a feature is not readily available in many existing solvers. In this study, we explore the feasibility of end-to-end training of a hybrid model with a black-box PDE solver and a deep learning model for fluid flow prediction. Specifically, we investigate a hybrid model that integrates a black-box PDE solver into a differentiable deep graph neural network. To train this model, we use a zeroth-order gradient estimator to differentiate the PDE solver via forward propagation. Although experiments show that the proposed approach based on zeroth-order gradient estimation underperforms the baseline that computes exact derivatives using automatic differentiation, our proposed method outperforms the baseline trained with a frozen input mesh to the solver. Moreover, with a simple warm-start on the neural network parameters, we show that models trained by these zeroth-order algorithms achieve an accelerated convergence and improved generalization performance.</description>

      <title>QGen: On the Ability to Generalize in Quantization Aware Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization lowers memory usage, computational requirements, and latency by utilizing fewer bits to represent model weights and activations. In this work, we investigate the generalization properties of quantized neural networks, a characteristic that has received little attention despite its implications on model performance. In particular, first, we develop a theoretical model for quantization in neural networks and demonstrate how quantization functions as a form of regularization. Second, motivated by recent work connecting the sharpness of the loss landscape and generalization, we derive an approximate bound for the generalization of quantized models conditioned on the amount of quantization noise. We then validate our hypothesis by experimenting with over 2000 models trained on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets on convolutional and transformer-based models.</description>

      <title>3D object quality prediction for Metal Jet Printer with Multimodal thermal encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancements in 3D printing technologies, it is extremely important that the quality of 3D printed objects, and dimensional accuracies should meet the customer's specifications. Various factors during metal printing affect the printed parts' quality, including the power quality, the printing stage parameters, the print part's location inside the print bed, the curing stage parameters, and the metal sintering process. With the large data gathered from HP's MetJet printing process, AI techniques can be used to analyze, learn, and effectively infer the printed part quality metrics, as well as assist in improving the print yield. In-situ thermal sensing data captured by printer-installed thermal sensors contains the part thermal signature of fusing layers. Such part thermal signature contains a convoluted impact from various factors. In this paper, we use a multimodal thermal encoder network to fuse data of a different nature including the video data vectorized printer control data, and exact part thermal signatures with a trained encoder-decoder module. We explored the data fusing techniques and stages for data fusing, the optimized end-to-end model architecture indicates an improved part quality prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Driven Feature Diffusion for Open-World Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach termed Prompt-Driven Feature Diffusion (PDFD) within a semi-supervised learning framework for Open World Semi-Supervised Learning (OW-SSL). At its core, PDFD deploys an efficient feature-level diffusion model with the guidance of class-specific prompts to support discriminative feature representation learning and feature generation, tackling the challenge of the non-availability of labeled data for unseen classes in OW-SSL. In particular, PDFD utilizes class prototypes as prompts in the diffusion model, leveraging their class-discriminative and semantic generalization ability to condition and guide the diffusion process across all the seen and unseen classes. Furthermore, PDFD incorporates a class-conditional adversarial loss for diffusion model training, ensuring that the features generated via the diffusion process can be discriminatively aligned with the class-conditional features of the real data. Additionally, the class prototypes of the unseen classes are computed using only unlabeled instances with confident predictions within a semi-supervised learning framework. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed PDFD. The empirical results show PDFD exhibits remarkable performance enhancements over many state-of-the-art existing methods.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Generative Adversarial Networks for Smooth Airfoil Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of aerospace design, achieving smooth curves is paramount, particularly when crafting objects such as airfoils. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), a widely employed generative AI technique, has proven instrumental in synthesizing airfoil designs. However, a common limitation of GAN is the inherent lack of smoothness in the generated airfoil surfaces. To address this issue, we present a GAN model featuring a customized loss function built to produce seamlessly contoured airfoil designs. Additionally, our model demonstrates a substantial increase in design diversity compared to a conventional GAN augmented with a post-processing smoothing filter.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Self-supervised Learning with Sampling-efficient Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) provides a promising alternative for representation learning on hypergraphs without costly labels. However, existing hypergraph SSL models are mostly based on contrastive methods with the instance-level discrimination strategy, suffering from two significant limitations: (1) They select negative samples arbitrarily, which is unreliable in deciding similar and dissimilar pairs, causing training bias. (2) They often require a large number of negative samples, resulting in expensive computational costs. To address the above issues, we propose SE-HSSL, a hypergraph SSL framework with three sampling-efficient self-supervised signals. Specifically, we introduce two sampling-free objectives leveraging the canonical correlation analysis as the node-level and group-level self-supervised signals. Additionally, we develop a novel hierarchical membership-level contrast objective motivated by the cascading overlap relationship in hypergraphs, which can further reduce membership sampling bias and improve the efficiency of sample utilization. Through comprehensive experiments on 7 real-world hypergraphs, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art method in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning with Phased Actor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods in actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) have become perhaps the most promising approaches to solving continuous optimal control problems. However, the trial-and-error nature of RL and the inherent randomness associated with solution approximations cause variations in the learned optimal values and policies. This has significantly hindered their successful deployment in real life applications where control responses need to meet dynamic performance criteria deterministically. Here we propose a novel phased actor in actor-critic (PAAC) method, aiming at improving policy gradient estimation and thus the quality of the control policy. Specifically, PAAC accounts for both $Q$ value and TD error in its actor update. We prove qualitative properties of PAAC for learning convergence of the value and policy, solution optimality, and stability of system dynamics. Additionally, we show variance reduction in policy gradient estimation. PAAC performance is systematically and quantitatively evaluated in this study using DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Results show that PAAC leads to significant performance improvement measured by total cost, learning variance, robustness, learning speed and success rate. As PAAC can be piggybacked onto general policy gradient learning frameworks, we select well-known methods such as direct heuristic dynamic programming (dHDP), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and their variants to demonstrate the effectiveness of PAAC. Consequently we provide a unified view on these related policy gradient algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Graph Structural Representation Learning via Graph Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have made remarkable achievements in graph-level tasks. However, most existing works regard graph structures as a form of guidance or bias for enhancing node representations, which focuses on node-central perspectives and lacks explicit representations of edges and structures. One natural question is, can we treat graph structures node-like as a whole to learn high-level features? Through experimental analysis, we explore the feasibility of this assumption. Based on our findings, we propose a novel multi-view graph structural representation learning model via graph coarsening (MSLgo) on GT architecture for graph classification. Specifically, we build three unique views, original, coarsening, and conversion, to learn a thorough structural representation. We compress loops and cliques via hierarchical heuristic graph coarsening and restrict them with well-designed constraints, which builds the coarsening view to learn high-level interactions between structures. We also introduce line graphs for edge embeddings and switch to edge-central perspective to construct the conversion view. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the improvements of MSLgo over 14 baselines from various architectures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Length Extrapolation in Sequential Models with Pointer-Augmented Neural Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Pointer-Augmented Neural Memory (PANM) to help neural networks understand and apply symbol processing to new, longer sequences of data. PANM integrates an external neural memory that uses novel physical addresses and pointer manipulation techniques to mimic human and computer symbol processing abilities. PANM facilitates pointer assignment, dereference, and arithmetic by explicitly using physical pointers to access memory content. Remarkably, it can learn to perform these operations through end-to-end training on sequence data, powering various sequential models. Our experiments demonstrate PANM's exceptional length extrapolating capabilities and improved performance in tasks that require symbol processing, such as algorithmic reasoning and Dyck language recognition. PANM helps Transformer achieve up to 100% generalization accuracy in compositional learning tasks and significantly better results in mathematical reasoning, question answering and machine translation tasks.</description>

      <title>Using a Local Surrogate Model to Interpret Temporal Shifts in Global Annual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on explaining changes over time in globally-sourced, annual temporal data, with the specific objective of identifying pivotal factors that contribute to these temporal shifts. Leveraging such analytical frameworks can yield transformative impacts, including the informed refinement of public policy and the identification of key drivers affecting a country's economic evolution. We employ Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to shed light on national happiness indices, economic freedom, and population metrics, spanning variable time frames. Acknowledging the presence of missing values, we employ three imputation approaches to generate robust multivariate time-series datasets apt for LIME's input requirements. Our methodology's efficacy is substantiated through a series of empirical evaluations involving multiple datasets. These evaluations include comparative analyses against random feature selection, correlation with real-world events as elucidated by LIME, and validation through Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, a state-of-the-art technique proficient in feature importance detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm that allows different clients to train one powerful global model without sharing their private data. Although FL has demonstrated promising results in various applications, it is known to suffer from convergence issues caused by the data distribution shift across different clients, especially on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. In this paper, we study the convergence of FL on non-IID data and propose a novel \emph{Dog Walking Theory} to formulate and identify the missing element in existing research. The Dog Walking Theory describes the process of a dog walker leash walking multiple dogs from one side of the park to the other. The goal of the dog walker is to arrive at the right destination while giving the dogs enough exercise (i.e., space exploration). In FL, the server is analogous to the dog walker while the clients are analogous to the dogs. This analogy allows us to identify one crucial yet missing element in existing FL algorithms: the leash that guides the exploration of the clients. To address this gap, we propose a novel FL algorithm \emph{FedWalk} that leverages an external easy-to-converge task at the server side as a \emph{leash task} to guide the local training of the clients. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FedWalk with respect to data heterogeneity (between server and clients) and task discrepancy (between the leash and the original tasks). Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedWalk over state-of-the-art FL methods under both IID and non-IID settings.</description>

      <title>FedMID: A Data-Free Method for Using Intermediate Outputs as a Defense Mechanism Against Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning combines local updates from clients to produce a global model, which is susceptible to poisoning attacks. Most previous defense strategies relied on vectors derived from projections of local updates on a Euclidean space; however, these methods fail to accurately represent the functionality and structure of local models, resulting in inconsistent performance. Here, we present a new paradigm to defend against poisoning attacks in federated learning using functional mappings of local models based on intermediate outputs. Experiments show that our mechanism is robust under a broad range of computing conditions and advanced attack scenarios, enabling safer collaboration among data-sensitive participants via federated learning.</description>

      <title>Expected Coordinate Improvement for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is very popular for solving low-dimensional expensive optimization problems. Extending Bayesian optimization to high dimension is a meaningful but challenging task. One of the major challenges is that it is difficult to find good infill solutions as the acquisition functions are also high-dimensional. In this work, we propose the expected coordinate improvement (ECI) criterion for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization. The proposed ECI criterion measures the potential improvement we can get by moving the current best solution along one coordinate. The proposed approach selects the coordinate with the highest ECI value to refine in each iteration and covers all the coordinates gradually by iterating over the coordinates. The greatest advantage of the proposed ECI-BO (expected coordinate improvement based Bayesian optimization) algorithm over the standard BO algorithm is that the infill selection problem of the proposed algorithm is always a one-dimensional problem thus can be easily solved. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significantly better results than the standard BO algorithm and competitive results when compared with five state-of-the-art high-dimensional BOs. This work provides a simple but efficient approach for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <title>Redefining the Shortest Path Problem Formulation of the Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model: Pairwise Likelihood Ratios, Prior Knowledge, and Path Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective causal discovery is essential for learning the causal graph from observational data. The linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM) operates under the assumption of a linear data generating process with non-Gaussian noise in determining the causal graph. Its assumption of unmeasured confounders being absent, however, poses practical limitations. In response, empirical research has shown that the reformulation of LiNGAM as a shortest path problem (LiNGAM-SPP) addresses this limitation. Within LiNGAM-SPP, mutual information is chosen to serve as the measure of independence. A challenge is introduced - parameter tuning is now needed due to its reliance on kNN mutual information estimators. The paper proposes a threefold enhancement to the LiNGAM-SPP framework.
  First, the need for parameter tuning is eliminated by using the pairwise likelihood ratio in lieu of kNN-based mutual information. This substitution is validated on a general data generating process and benchmark real-world data sets, outperforming existing methods especially when given a larger set of features. The incorporation of prior knowledge is then enabled by a node-skipping strategy implemented on the graph representation of all causal orderings to eliminate violations based on the provided input of relative orderings. Flexibility relative to existing approaches is achieved. Last among the three enhancements is the utilization of the distribution of paths in the graph representation of all causal orderings. From this, crucial properties of the true causal graph such as the presence of unmeasured confounders and sparsity may be inferred. To some extent, the expected performance of the causal discovery algorithm may be predicted. The refinements above advance the practicality and performance of LiNGAM-SPP, showcasing the potential of graph-search-based methodologies in advancing causal discovery.</description>

      <title>EdgeFusion: On-Device Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intensive computational burden of Stable Diffusion (SD) for text-to-image generation poses a significant hurdle for its practical application. To tackle this challenge, recent research focuses on methods to reduce sampling steps, such as Latent Consistency Model (LCM), and on employing architectural optimizations, including pruning and knowledge distillation. Diverging from existing approaches, we uniquely start with a compact SD variant, BK-SDM. We observe that directly applying LCM to BK-SDM with commonly used crawled datasets yields unsatisfactory results. It leads us to develop two strategies: (1) leveraging high-quality image-text pairs from leading generative models and (2) designing an advanced distillation process tailored for LCM. Through our thorough exploration of quantization, profiling, and on-device deployment, we achieve rapid generation of photo-realistic, text-aligned images in just two steps, with latency under one second on resource-limited edge devices.</description>

      <title>LD-Pruner: Efficient Pruning of Latent Diffusion Models using Task-Agnostic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have emerged as powerful generative models, known for delivering remarkable results under constrained computational resources. However, deploying LDMs on resource-limited devices remains a complex issue, presenting challenges such as memory consumption and inference speed. To address this issue, we introduce LD-Pruner, a novel performance-preserving structured pruning method for compressing LDMs. Traditional pruning methods for deep neural networks are not tailored to the unique characteristics of LDMs, such as the high computational cost of training and the absence of a fast, straightforward and task-agnostic method for evaluating model performance. Our method tackles these challenges by leveraging the latent space during the pruning process, enabling us to effectively quantify the impact of pruning on model performance, independently of the task at hand. This targeted pruning of components with minimal impact on the output allows for faster convergence during training, as the model has less information to re-learn, thereby addressing the high computational cost of training. Consequently, our approach achieves a compressed model that offers improved inference speed and reduced parameter count, while maintaining minimal performance degradation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three different tasks: text-to-image (T2I) generation, Unconditional Image Generation (UIG) and Unconditional Audio Generation (UAG). Notably, we reduce the inference time of Stable Diffusion (SD) by 34.9% while simultaneously improving its FID by 5.2% on MS-COCO T2I benchmark. This work paves the way for more efficient pruning methods for LDMs, enhancing their applicability.</description>

      <title>Trusted Multi-view Learning with Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view learning methods often focus on improving decision accuracy while neglecting the decision uncertainty, which significantly restricts their applications in safety-critical applications. To address this issue, researchers propose trusted multi-view methods that learn the class distribution for each instance, enabling the estimation of classification probabilities and uncertainty. However, these methods heavily rely on high-quality ground-truth labels. This motivates us to delve into a new generalized trusted multi-view learning problem: how to develop a reliable multi-view learning model under the guidance of noisy labels? We propose a trusted multi-view noise refining method to solve this problem. We first construct view-opinions using evidential deep neural networks, which consist of belief mass vectors and uncertainty estimates. Subsequently, we design view-specific noise correlation matrices that transform the original opinions into noisy opinions aligned with the noisy labels. Considering label noises originating from low-quality data features and easily-confused classes, we ensure that the diagonal elements of these matrices are inversely proportional to the uncertainty, while incorporating class relations into the off-diagonal elements. Finally, we aggregate the noisy opinions and employ a generalized maximum likelihood loss on the aggregated opinion for model training, guided by the noisy labels. We empirically compare TMNR with state-of-the-art trusted multi-view learning and label noise learning baselines on 5 publicly available datasets. Experiment results show that TMNR outperforms baseline methods on accuracy, reliability and robustness. We promise to release the code and all datasets on Github and show the link here.</description>

      <title>VCC-INFUSE: Towards Accurate and Efficient Selection of Unlabeled Examples in Semi-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the progress of Semi-supervised Learning (SSL), existing methods fail to utilize unlabeled data effectively and efficiently. Many pseudo-label-based methods select unlabeled examples based on inaccurate confidence scores from the classifier. Most prior work also uses all available unlabeled data without pruning, making it difficult to handle large amounts of unlabeled data. To address these issues, we propose two methods: Variational Confidence Calibration (VCC) and Influence-Function-based Unlabeled Sample Elimination (INFUSE). VCC is an universal plugin for SSL confidence calibration, using a variational autoencoder to select more accurate pseudo labels based on three types of consistency scores. INFUSE is a data pruning method that constructs a core dataset of unlabeled examples under SSL. Our methods are effective in multiple datasets and settings, reducing classification errors rates and saving training time. Together, VCC-INFUSE reduces the error rate of FlexMatch on the CIFAR-100 dataset by 1.08% while saving nearly half of the training time.</description>

      <title>FastVPINNs: Tensor-Driven Acceleration of VPINNs for Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks (VPINNs) utilize a variational loss function to solve partial differential equations, mirroring Finite Element Analysis techniques. Traditional hp-VPINNs, while effective for high-frequency problems, are computationally intensive and scale poorly with increasing element counts, limiting their use in complex geometries. This work introduces FastVPINNs, a tensor-based advancement that significantly reduces computational overhead and improves scalability. Using optimized tensor operations, FastVPINNs achieve a 100-fold reduction in the median training time per epoch compared to traditional hp-VPINNs. With proper choice of hyperparameters, FastVPINNs surpass conventional PINNs in both speed and accuracy, especially in problems with high-frequency solutions. Demonstrated effectiveness in solving inverse problems on complex domains underscores FastVPINNs' potential for widespread application in scientific and engineering challenges, opening new avenues for practical implementations in scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Sequential Federated Learning for Non-IID Data by Enhancing Local Model Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional federated learning mainly focuses on parallel settings (PFL), which can suffer significant communication and computation costs. In contrast, one-shot and sequential federated learning (SFL) have emerged as innovative paradigms to alleviate these costs. However, the issue of non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data persists as a significant challenge in one-shot and SFL settings, exacerbated by the restricted communication between clients. In this paper, we improve the one-shot sequential federated learning for non-IID data by proposing a local model diversity-enhancing strategy. Specifically, to leverage the potential of local model diversity for improving model performance, we introduce a local model pool for each client that comprises diverse models generated during local training, and propose two distance measurements to further enhance the model diversity and mitigate the effect of non-IID data. Consequently, our proposed framework can improve the global model performance while maintaining low communication costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits superior performance to existing one-shot PFL methods and achieves better accuracy compared with state-of-the-art one-shot SFL methods on both label-skew and domain-shift tasks (e.g., 6%+ accuracy improvement on the CIFAR-10 dataset).</description>

      <title>Aligning language models with human preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) trained on vast quantities of text data can acquire sophisticated skills such as generating summaries, answering questions or generating code. However, they also manifest behaviors that violate human preferences, e.g., they can generate offensive content, falsehoods or perpetuate social biases. In this thesis, I explore several approaches to aligning LMs with human preferences. First, I argue that aligning LMs can be seen as Bayesian inference: conditioning a prior (base, pretrained LM) on evidence about human preferences (Chapter 2). Conditioning on human preferences can be implemented in numerous ways. In Chapter 3, I investigate the relation between two approaches to finetuning pretrained LMs using feedback given by a scoring function: reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and distribution matching. I show that RLHF can be seen as a special case of distribution matching but distributional matching is strictly more general. In chapter 4, I show how to extend the distribution matching to conditional language models. Finally, in chapter 5 I explore a different root: conditioning an LM on human preferences already during pretraining. I show that involving human feedback from the very start tends to be more effective than using it only during supervised finetuning. Overall, these results highlight the room for alignment techniques different from and complementary to RLHF.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving UCB Decision Process Verification via zk-SNARKs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasingly widespread application of machine learning, how to strike a balance between protecting the privacy of data and algorithm parameters and ensuring the verifiability of machine learning has always been a challenge. This study explores the intersection of reinforcement learning and data privacy, specifically addressing the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem with the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. We introduce zkUCB, an innovative algorithm that employs the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) to enhance UCB. zkUCB is carefully designed to safeguard the confidentiality of training data and algorithmic parameters, ensuring transparent UCB decision-making. Experiments highlight zkUCB's superior performance, attributing its enhanced reward to judicious quantization bit usage that reduces information entropy in the decision-making process. zkUCB's proof size and verification time scale linearly with the execution steps of zkUCB. This showcases zkUCB's adept balance between data security and operational efficiency. This approach contributes significantly to the ongoing discourse on reinforcing data privacy in complex decision-making processes, offering a promising solution for privacy-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Hessian Matrix of Ranking Objectives for Stochastic Learning to Rank with Gradient Boosted Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic learning to rank (LTR) is a recent branch in the LTR field that concerns the optimization of probabilistic ranking models. Their probabilistic behavior enables certain ranking qualities that are impossible with deterministic models. For example, they can increase the diversity of displayed documents, increase fairness of exposure over documents, and better balance exploitation and exploration through randomization. A core difficulty in LTR is gradient estimation, for this reason, existing stochastic LTR methods have been limited to differentiable ranking models (e.g., neural networks). This is in stark contrast with the general field of LTR where Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) have long been considered the state-of-the-art.
  In this work, we address this gap by introducing the first stochastic LTR method for GBDTs. Our main contribution is a novel estimator for the second-order derivatives, i.e., the Hessian matrix, which is a requirement for effective GBDTs. To efficiently compute both the first and second-order derivatives simultaneously, we incorporate our estimator into the existing PL-Rank framework, which was originally designed for first-order derivatives only. Our experimental results indicate that stochastic LTR without the Hessian has extremely poor performance, whilst the performance is competitive with the current state-of-the-art with our estimated Hessian. Thus, through the contribution of our novel Hessian estimation method, we have successfully introduced GBDTs to stochastic LTR.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty with Proper Scoring Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty representation and quantification are paramount in machine learning and constitute an important prerequisite for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose novel measures for the quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, which are loss functions with the meaningful property that they incentivize the learner to predict ground-truth (conditional) probabilities. We assume two common representations of (epistemic) uncertainty, namely, in terms of a credal set, i.e. a set of probability distributions, or a second-order distribution, i.e., a distribution over probability distributions. Our framework establishes a natural bridge between these representations. We provide a formal justification of our approach and introduce new measures of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty as concrete instantiations.</description>

      <title>A Quadrature Approach for General-Purpose Batch Bayesian Optimization via Probabilistic Lifting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallelisation in Bayesian optimisation is a common strategy but faces several challenges: the need for flexibility in acquisition functions and kernel choices, flexibility dealing with discrete and continuous variables simultaneously, model misspecification, and lastly fast massive parallelisation. To address these challenges, we introduce a versatile and modular framework for batch Bayesian optimisation via probabilistic lifting with kernel quadrature, called SOBER, which we present as a Python library based on GPyTorch/BoTorch. Our framework offers the following unique benefits: (1) Versatility in downstream tasks under a unified approach. (2) A gradient-free sampler, which does not require the gradient of acquisition functions, offering domain-agnostic sampling (e.g., discrete and mixed variables, non-Euclidean space). (3) Flexibility in domain prior distribution. (4) Adaptive batch size (autonomous determination of the optimal batch size). (5) Robustness against a misspecified reproducing kernel Hilbert space. (6) Natural stopping criterion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning techniques for the estimation of treatment effects. Most of the best-performing methods rely on representation learning strategies that encourage shared behavior among potential outcomes to increase the precision of treatment effect estimates. In this paper we discuss and classify these models in terms of their algorithmic inductive biases and present a new model, NN-CGC, that considers additional information from the causal graph. NN-CGC tackles bias resulting from spurious variable interactions by implementing novel constraints on models, and it can be integrated with other representation learning methods. We test the effectiveness of our method using three different base models on common benchmarks. Our results indicate that our model constraints lead to significant improvements, achieving new state-of-the-art results in treatment effects estimation. We also show that our method is robust to imperfect causal graphs and that using partial causal information is preferable to ignoring it.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modality and View Selection for Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of human emotions, traditionally a cornerstone in fields like psychology and neuroscience, has been profoundly impacted by the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Multiple channels, such as speech (voice) and facial expressions (image), are crucial in understanding human emotions. However, AI's journey in multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is marked by substantial technical challenges. One significant hurdle is how AI models manage the absence of a particular modality - a frequent occurrence in real-world situations. This study's central focus is assessing the performance and resilience of two strategies when confronted with the lack of one modality: a novel multimodal dynamic modality and view selection and a cross-attention mechanism. Results on the RECOLA dataset show that dynamic selection-based methods are a promising approach for MER. In the missing modalities scenarios, all dynamic selection-based methods outperformed the baseline. The study concludes by emphasizing the intricate interplay between audio and video modalities in emotion prediction, showcasing the adaptability of dynamic selection methods in handling missing modalities.</description>

      <title>Physics-integrated generative modeling using attentive planar normalizing flow based variational autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-integrated generative modeling is a class of hybrid or grey-box modeling in which we augment the the data-driven model with the physics knowledge governing the data distribution. The use of physics knowledge allows the generative model to produce output in a controlled way, so that the output, by construction, complies with the physical laws. It imparts improved generalization ability to extrapolate beyond the training distribution as well as improved interpretability because the model is partly grounded in firm domain knowledge. In this work, we aim to improve the fidelity of reconstruction and robustness to noise in the physics integrated generative model. To this end, we use variational-autoencoder as a generative model. To improve the reconstruction results of the decoder, we propose to learn the latent posterior distribution of both the physics as well as the trainable data-driven components using planar normalizng flow. Normalizng flow based posterior distribution harnesses the inherent dynamical structure of the data distribution, hence the learned model gets closer to the true underlying data distribution. To improve the robustness of generative model against noise injected in the model, we propose a modification in the encoder part of the normalizing flow based VAE. We designed the encoder to incorporate scaled dot product attention based contextual information in the noisy latent vector which will mitigate the adverse effect of noise in the latent vector and make the model more robust. We empirically evaluated our models on human locomotion dataset [33] and the results validate the efficacy of our proposed models in terms of improvement in reconstruction quality as well as robustness against noise injected in the model.</description>

      <title>Investigating Guiding Information for Adaptive Collocation Point Sampling in PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a means of obtaining approximate solutions of partial differential equations and systems through the minimisation of an objective function which includes the evaluation of a residual function at a set of collocation points within the domain. The quality of a PINNs solution depends upon numerous parameters, including the number and distribution of these collocation points. In this paper we consider a number of strategies for selecting these points and investigate their impact on the overall accuracy of the method. In particular, we suggest that no single approach is likely to be ``optimal'' but we show how a number of important metrics can have an impact in improving the quality of the results obtained when using a fixed number of residual evaluations. We illustrate these approaches through the use of two benchmark test problems: Burgers' equation and the Allen-Cahn equation.</description>

      <title>Singular-limit analysis of gradient descent with noise injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limiting dynamics of a large class of noisy gradient descent systems in the overparameterized regime. In this regime the set of global minimizers of the loss is large, and when initialized in a neighbourhood of this zero-loss set a noisy gradient descent algorithm slowly evolves along this set. In some cases this slow evolution has been related to better generalisation properties. We characterize this evolution for the broad class of noisy gradient descent systems in the limit of small step size. Our results show that the structure of the noise affects not just the form of the limiting process, but also the time scale at which the evolution takes place. We apply the theory to Dropout, label noise and classical SGD (minibatching) noise, and show that these evolve on different two time scales. Classical SGD even yields a trivial evolution on both time scales, implying that additional noise is required for regularization. The results are inspired by the training of neural networks, but the theorems apply to noisy gradient descent of any loss that has a non-trivial zero-loss set.</description>

      <title>A Mean-Field Analysis of Neural Gradient Descent-Ascent: Applications to Functional Conditional Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study minimax optimization problems defined over infinite-dimensional function classes. In particular, we restrict the functions to the class of overparameterized two-layer neural networks and study (i) the convergence of the gradient descent-ascent algorithm and (ii) the representation learning of the neural network. As an initial step, we consider the minimax optimization problem stemming from estimating a functional equation defined by conditional expectations via adversarial estimation, where the objective function is quadratic in the functional space. For this problem, we establish convergence under the mean-field regime by considering the continuous-time and infinite-width limit of the optimization dynamics. Under this regime, gradient descent-ascent corresponds to a Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of probability measures defined over the space of neural network parameters. We prove that the Wasserstein gradient flow converges globally to a stationary point of the minimax objective at a $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1} + \alpha^{-1} ) $ sublinear rate, and additionally finds the solution to the functional equation when the regularizer of the minimax objective is strongly convex. Here $T$ denotes the time and $\alpha$ is a scaling parameter of the neural network. In terms of representation learning, our results show that the feature representation induced by the neural networks is allowed to deviate from the initial one by the magnitude of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{-1})$, measured in terms of the Wasserstein distance. Finally, we apply our general results to concrete examples including policy evaluation, nonparametric instrumental variable regression, and asset pricing.</description>

      <title>Guided Discrete Diffusion for Electronic Health Record Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a pivotal data source that enables numerous applications in computational medicine, e.g., disease progression prediction, clinical trial design, and health economics and outcomes research. Despite wide usability, their sensitive nature raises privacy and confidentially concerns, which limit potential use cases. To tackle these challenges, we explore the use of generative models to synthesize artificial, yet realistic EHRs. While diffusion-based methods have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in generating other data modalities and overcome the training instability and mode collapse issues that plague previous GAN-based approaches, their applications in EHR generation remain underexplored. The discrete nature of tabular medical code data in EHRs poses challenges for high-quality data generation, especially for continuous diffusion models. To this end, we introduce a novel tabular EHR generation method, EHR-D3PM, which enables both unconditional and conditional generation using the discrete diffusion model. Our experiments demonstrate that EHR-D3PM significantly outperforms existing generative baselines on comprehensive fidelity and utility metrics while maintaining less membership vulnerability risks. Furthermore, we show EHR-D3PM is effective as a data augmentation method and enhances performance on downstream tasks when combined with real data.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Sensitivities of Chaotic Flows without Adjoint Solvers: A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In one calculation, adjoint sensitivity analysis provides the gradient of a quantity of interest with respect to all system's parameters. Conventionally, adjoint solvers need to be implemented by differentiating computational models, which can be a cumbersome task and is code-specific. To propose an adjoint solver that is not code-specific, we develop a data-driven strategy. We demonstrate its application on the computation of gradients of long-time averages of chaotic flows. First, we deploy a parameter-aware echo state network (ESN) to accurately forecast and simulate the dynamics of a dynamical system for a range of system's parameters. Second, we derive the adjoint of the parameter-aware ESN. Finally, we combine the parameter-aware ESN with its adjoint version to compute the sensitivities to the system parameters. We showcase the method on a prototypical chaotic system. Because adjoint sensitivities in chaotic regimes diverge for long integration times, we analyse the application of ensemble adjoint method to the ESN. We find that the adjoint sensitivities obtained from the ESN match closely with the original system. This work opens possibilities for sensitivity analysis without code-specific adjoint solvers.</description>

      <title>Measuring Feature Dependency of Neural Networks by Collapsing Feature Dimensions in the Data Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new technique to measure the feature dependency of neural network models. The motivation is to better understand a model by querying whether it is using information from human-understandable features, e.g., anatomical shape, volume, or image texture. Our method is based on the principle that if a model is dependent on a feature, then removal of that feature should significantly harm its performance. A targeted feature is "removed" by collapsing the dimension in the data distribution that corresponds to that feature. We perform this by moving data points along the feature dimension to a baseline feature value while staying on the data manifold, as estimated by a deep generative model. Then we observe how the model's performance changes on the modified test data set, with the target feature dimension removed. We test our method on deep neural network models trained on synthetic image data with known ground truth, an Alzheimer's disease prediction task using MRI and hippocampus segmentations from the OASIS-3 dataset, and a cell nuclei classification task using the Lizard dataset.</description>

      <title>Towards a Foundation Model for Partial Differential Equation: Multi-Operator Learning and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models, such as large language models, have demonstrated success in addressing various language and image processing tasks. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>From $r$ to $Q^*$: Your Language Model is Secretly a Q-Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been a critical to the success of the latest generation of generative AI models. In response to the complex nature of the classical RLHF pipeline, direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as an alternative approach. Although DPO solves the same objective as the standard RLHF setup, there is a mismatch between the two approaches. Standard RLHF deploys reinforcement learning in a specific token-level MDP, while DPO is derived as a bandit problem in which the whole response of the model is treated as a single arm. In this work we rectify this difference, first we theoretically show that we can derive DPO in the token-level MDP as a general inverse Q-learning algorithm, which satisfies the Bellman equation. Using our theoretical results, we provide three concrete empirical insights. First, we show that because of its token level interpretation, DPO is able to perform some type of credit assignment. Next, we prove that under the token level formulation, classical search-based algorithms, such as MCTS, which have recently been applied to the language generation space, are equivalent to likelihood-based search on a DPO policy. Empirically we show that a simple beam search yields meaningful improvement over the base DPO policy. Finally, we show how the choice of reference policy causes implicit rewards to decline during training. We conclude by discussing applications of our work, including information elicitation in multi-tun dialogue, reasoning, agentic applications and end-to-end training of multi-model systems.</description>

      <title>Transformer tricks: Removing weights for skipless transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: He and Hofmann (arXiv:2311.01906) detailed a skipless transformer without the V and P (post-attention projection) linear layers, which reduces the total number of weights. However, this scheme is only applicable to MHA (multi-head attention), but not for MQA (multi-query attention) and GQA (grouped-query attention). The latter schemes are used by many popular LLMs such as Llama 2, Mistral, Mixtral, PaLM, and Gemma. Therefore, this micro-paper proposes mathematically equivalent versions that are suitable for MQA and GQA. For example, removing Q and P from a skipless version of Mistral-7B would remove 15% of its weights (and thus reduce its compute and memory complexity). See arXiv:2402.13388 and https://github.com/OpenMachine-ai/transformer-tricks for code and more transformer tricks.</description>

      <title>Accounting for AI and Users Shaping One Another: The Role of Mathematical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems enter into a growing number of societal domains, these systems increasingly shape and are shaped by user preferences, opinions, and behaviors. However, the design of AI systems rarely accounts for how AI and users shape one another. In this position paper, we argue for the development of formal interaction models which mathematically specify how AI and users shape one another. Formal interaction models can be leveraged to (1) specify interactions for implementation, (2) monitor interactions through empirical analysis, (3) anticipate societal impacts via counterfactual analysis, and (4) control societal impacts via interventions. The design space of formal interaction models is vast, and model design requires careful consideration of factors such as style, granularity, mathematical complexity, and measurability. Using content recommender systems as a case study, we critically examine the nascent literature of formal interaction models with respect to these use-cases and design axes. More broadly, we call for the community to leverage formal interaction models when designing, evaluating, or auditing any AI system which interacts with users.</description>

      <title>KDk: A Defense Mechanism Against Label Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a category of Federated Learning in which models are trained collaboratively among parties with vertically partitioned data. Typically, in a VFL scenario, the labels of the samples are kept private from all the parties except for the aggregating server, that is the label owner. Nevertheless, recent works discovered that by exploiting gradient information returned by the server to bottom models, with the knowledge of only a small set of auxiliary labels on a very limited subset of training data points, an adversary can infer the private labels. These attacks are known as label inference attacks in VFL. In our work, we propose a novel framework called KDk, that combines Knowledge Distillation and k-anonymity to provide a defense mechanism against potential label inference attacks in a VFL scenario. Through an exhaustive experimental campaign we demonstrate that by applying our approach, the performance of the analyzed label inference attacks decreases consistently, even by more than 60%, maintaining the accuracy of the whole VFL almost unaltered.</description>

      <title>Matching the Statistical Query Lower Bound for k-sparse Parity Problems with Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-parity problem is a classical problem in computational complexity and algorithmic theory, serving as a key benchmark for understanding computational classes. In this paper, we solve the $k$-parity problem with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on two-layer fully-connected neural networks. We demonstrate that SGD can efficiently solve the $k$-sparse parity problem on a $d$-dimensional hypercube ($k\le O(\sqrt{d})$) with a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(d^{k-1})$ using $2^{\Theta(k)}$ neurons, thus matching the established $\Omega(d^{k})$ lower bounds of Statistical Query (SQ) models. Our theoretical analysis begins by constructing a good neural network capable of correctly solving the $k$-parity problem. We then demonstrate how a trained neural network with SGD can effectively approximate this good network, solving the $k$-parity problem with small statistical errors. Our theoretical results and findings are supported by empirical evidence, showcasing the efficiency and efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Token Space framework, a novel mathematical construct designed to enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of deep learning models through the application of category theory. By establishing a categorical structure at the Token level, we provide a new lens through which AI computations can be understood, emphasizing the relationships between tokens, such as grouping, order, and parameter types. We explore the foundational methodologies of the Token Space, detailing its construction, the role of construction operators and initial categories, and its application in analyzing deep learning models, specifically focusing on attention mechanisms and Transformer architectures. The integration of category theory into AI research offers a unified framework to describe and analyze computational structures, enabling new research paths and development possibilities. Our investigation reveals that the Token Space framework not only facilitates a deeper theoretical understanding of deep learning models but also opens avenues for the design of more efficient, interpretable, and innovative models, illustrating the significant role of category theory in advancing computational models.</description>

Abstract: Parcels delivery is a critical activity in railways. More importantly, each parcel must be thoroughly checked and sorted according to its destination address. We require an efficient and robust IoT system capable of doing all of these tasks with great precision and minimal human interaction. This paper discusses, We created a fully-fledged solution using IoT and machine learning to assist trains in performing this operation efficiently. In this study, we covered the product, which consists mostly of two phases. Scanning is the first step, followed by sorting. During the scanning process, the parcel will be passed through three scanners that will look for explosives, drugs, and any dangerous materials in the parcel and will trash it if any of the tests fail. When the scanning step is over, the parcel moves on to the sorting phase, where we use QR codes to retrieve the details of the parcels and sort them properly. The simulation of the system is done using the blender software. Our research shows that our procedure significantly improves accuracy as well as the assessment of cutting-edge technology and existing techniques.</description>

Abstract: Normalizing flows are machine-learned maps between different lattice theories which can be used as components in exact sampling and inference schemes. Ongoing work yields increasingly expressive flows on gauge fields, but it remains an open question how flows can improve lattice QCD at state-of-the-art scales. We discuss and demonstrate two applications of flows in replica exchange (parallel tempering) sampling, aimed at improving topological mixing, which are viable with iterative improvements upon presently available flows.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Networks-based Learning of Probabilistic Cellular Automata Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms developed to solve many-body quantum problems, like tensor networks, can turn into powerful quantum-inspired tools to tackle problems in the classical domain. In this work, we focus on matrix product operators, a prominent numerical technique to study many-body quantum systems, especially in one dimension. It has been previously shown that such a tool can be used for classification, learning of deterministic sequence-to-sequence processes and of generic quantum processes. We further develop a matrix product operator algorithm to learn probabilistic sequence-to-sequence processes and apply this algorithm to probabilistic cellular automata. This new approach can accurately learn probabilistic cellular automata processes in different conditions, even when the process is a probabilistic mixture of different chaotic rules. In addition, we find that the ability to learn these dynamics is a function of the bit-wise difference between the rules and whether one is much more likely than the other.</description>

      <title>REQUAL-LM: Reliability and Equity through Aggregation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extensive scope of large language models (LLMs) across various domains underscores the critical importance of responsibility in their application, beyond natural language processing. In particular, the randomized nature of LLMs, coupled with inherent biases and historical stereotypes in data, raises critical concerns regarding reliability and equity. Addressing these challenges are necessary before using LLMs for applications with societal impact. Towards addressing this gap, we introduce REQUAL-LM, a novel method for finding reliable and equitable LLM outputs through aggregation. Specifically, we develop a Monte Carlo method based on repeated sampling to find a reliable output close to the mean of the underlying distribution of possible outputs. We formally define the terms such as reliability and bias, and design an equity-aware aggregation to minimize harmful bias while finding a highly reliable output. REQUAL-LM does not require specialized hardware, does not impose a significant computing load, and uses LLMs as a blackbox. This design choice enables seamless scalability alongside the rapid advancement of LLM technologies. Our system does not require retraining the LLMs, which makes it deployment ready and easy to adapt. Our comprehensive experiments using various tasks and datasets demonstrate that REQUAL- LM effectively mitigates bias and selects a more equitable response, specifically the outputs that properly represents minority groups.</description>

      <title>NonGEMM Bench: Understanding the Performance Horizon of the Latest ML Workloads with NonGEMM Workloads</title>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) operators are the building blocks to design ML models with various target applications. GEneral Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operators are the backbone of ML models. They are notorious for being computationally expensive requiring billions of multiply-and-accumulate. Therefore, significant effort has been put to study and optimize the GEMM operators in order to speed up the execution of ML models. GPUs and accelerators are widely deployed to accelerate ML workloads by optimizing the execution of GEMM operators. Nonetheless, the performance of NonGEMM operators have not been studied as thoroughly as GEMMs. Therefore, this paper describes \bench, a benchmark to study NonGEMM operators. We first construct \bench using popular ML workloads from different domains, then perform case studies on various grade GPU platforms to analyze the behavior of NonGEMM operators in GPU accelerated systems. Finally, we present some key takeaways to bridge the gap between GEMM and NonGEMM operators and to offer the community with potential new optimization directions.</description>

      <title>When are Foundation Models Effective? Understanding the Suitability for Pixel-Level Classification Using Multispectral Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models, i.e., very large deep learning models, have demonstrated impressive performances in various language and vision tasks that are otherwise difficult to reach using smaller-size models. The major success of GPT-type of language models is particularly exciting and raises expectations on the potential of foundation models in other domains including satellite remote sensing. In this context, great efforts have been made to build foundation models to test their capabilities in broader applications, and examples include Prithvi by NASA-IBM, Segment-Anything-Model, ViT, etc. This leads to an important question: Are foundation models always a suitable choice for different remote sensing tasks, and when or when not? This work aims to enhance the understanding of the status and suitability of foundation models for pixel-level classification using multispectral imagery at moderate resolution, through comparisons with traditional machine learning (ML) and regular-size deep learning models. Interestingly, the results reveal that in many scenarios traditional ML models still have similar or better performance compared to foundation models, especially for tasks where texture is less useful for classification. On the other hand, deep learning models did show more promising results for tasks where labels partially depend on texture (e.g., burn scar), while the difference in performance between foundation models and deep learning models is not obvious. The results conform with our analysis: The suitability of foundation models depend on the alignment between the self-supervised learning tasks and the real downstream tasks, and the typical masked autoencoder paradigm is not necessarily suitable for many remote sensing problems.</description>

      <title>TempBEV: Improving Learned BEV Encoders with Combined Image and BEV Space Temporal Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an accurate representation of the environment. A strategy toward high accuracy is to fuse data from several sensors. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders can achieve this by mapping data from individual sensors into one joint latent space. For cost-efficient camera-only systems, this provides an effective mechanism to fuse data from multiple cameras with different views. Accuracy can further be improved by aggregating sensor information over time. This is especially important in monocular camera systems to account for the lack of explicit depth and velocity measurements. Thereby, the effectiveness of developed BEV encoders crucially depends on the operators used to aggregate temporal information and on the used latent representation spaces. We analyze BEV encoders proposed in the literature and compare their effectiveness, quantifying the effects of aggregation operators and latent representations. While most existing approaches aggregate temporal information either in image or in BEV latent space, our analyses and performance comparisons suggest that these latent representations exhibit complementary strengths. Therefore, we develop a novel temporal BEV encoder, TempBEV, which integrates aggregated temporal information from both latent spaces. We consider subsequent image frames as stereo through time and leverage methods from optical flow estimation for temporal stereo encoding. Empirical evaluation on the NuScenes dataset shows a significant improvement by TempBEV over the baseline for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation. The ablation uncovers a strong synergy of joint temporal aggregation in the image and BEV latent space. These results indicate the overall effectiveness of our approach and make a strong case for aggregating temporal information in both image and BEV latent spaces.</description>

      <title>Sharing Parameter by Conjugation for Knowledge Graph Embeddings in Complex Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Knowledge Graph (KG) is the directed graphical representation of entities and relations in the real world. KG can be applied in diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks where knowledge is required. The need to scale up and complete KG automatically yields Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), a shallow machine learning model that is suffering from memory and training time consumption issues. To mitigate the computational load, we propose a parameter-sharing method, i.e., using conjugate parameters for complex numbers employed in KGE models. Our method improves memory efficiency by 2x in relation embedding while achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art non-conjugate models, with faster, or at least comparable, training time. We demonstrated the generalizability of our method on two best-performing KGE models $5^{\bigstar}\mathrm{E}$ and $\mathrm{ComplEx}$ on five benchmark datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemical simulations can be greatly accelerated by constructing machine learning potentials, which is often done using active learning (AL). The usefulness of the constructed potentials is often limited by the high effort required and their insufficient robustness in the simulations. Here we introduce the end-to-end AL for constructing robust data-efficient potentials with affordable investment of time and resources and minimum human interference. Our AL protocol is based on the physics-informed sampling of training points, automatic selection of initial data, and uncertainty quantification. The versatility of this protocol is shown in our implementation of quasi-classical molecular dynamics for simulating vibrational spectra, conformer search of a key biochemical molecule, and time-resolved mechanism of the Diels-Alder reaction. These investigations took us days instead of weeks of pure quantum chemical calculations on a high-performance computing cluster.</description>

      <title>Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Thoracic Diseases in Chest X-rays using hybrid CNN-Transformer Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging has been used for diagnosis of various conditions, making it one of the most powerful resources for effective patient care. Due to widespread availability, low cost, and low radiation, chest X-ray is one of the most sought after radiology examination for the diagnosis of various thoracic diseases. Due to advancements in medical imaging technologies and increasing patient load, current radiology workflow faces various challenges including increasing backlogs, working long hours, and increase in diagnostic errors. An automated computer-aided diagnosis system that can interpret chest X-rays to augment radiologists by providing actionable insights has potential to provide second opinion to radiologists, highlight relevant regions in the image, in turn expediting clinical workflow, reducing diagnostic errors, and improving patient care. In this study, we applied a novel architecture augmenting the DenseNet121 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multi-head self-attention mechanism using transformer, namely SA-DenseNet121, that can identify multiple thoracic diseases in chest X-rays. We conducted experiments on four of the largest chest X-ray datasets, namely, ChestX-ray14, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR-JPG, and IU-CXR. Experimental results in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) shows that augmenting CNN with self-attention has potential in diagnosing different thoracic diseases from chest X-rays. The proposed methodology has the potential to support the reading workflow, improve efficiency, and reduce diagnostic errors.</description>

      <title>OPTiML: Dense Semantic Invariance Using Optimal Transport for Self-Supervised Medical Image Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising technique for medical image analysis due to its ability to learn without annotations. However, despite the promising potential, conventional SSL methods encounter limitations, including challenges in achieving semantic alignment and capturing subtle details. This leads to suboptimal representations, which fail to accurately capture the underlying anatomical structures and pathological details. In response to these constraints, we introduce a novel SSL framework OPTiML, employing optimal transport (OT), to capture the dense semantic invariance and fine-grained details, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of SSL in medical image representation learning. The core idea is to integrate OT with a cross-viewpoint semantics infusion module (CV-SIM), which effectively captures complex, fine-grained details inherent in medical images across different viewpoints. In addition to the CV-SIM module, OPTiML imposes the variance and covariance regularizations within OT framework to force the model focus on clinically relevant information while discarding less informative features. Through these, the proposed framework demonstrates its capacity to learn semantically rich representations that can be applied to various medical imaging tasks. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experimental studies on three publicly available datasets from chest X-ray modality. Our empirical results reveal OPTiML's superiority over state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks.</description>

Abstract: In the field of brain science, data sharing across servers is becoming increasingly challenging due to issues such as industry competition, privacy security, and administrative procedure policies and regulations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for data analysis and processing that enable scientific collaboration without data sharing. In view of this, this study proposes to study and develop a series of efficient non-negative coupled tensor decomposition algorithm frameworks based on federated learning called FCNCP for the EEG data arranged on different servers. It combining the good discriminative performance of tensor decomposition in high-dimensional data representation and decomposition, the advantages of coupled tensor decomposition in cross-sample tensor data analysis, and the features of federated learning for joint modelling in distributed servers. The algorithm utilises federation learning to establish coupling constraints for data distributed across different servers. In the experiments, firstly, simulation experiments are carried out using simulated data, and stable and consistent decomposition results are obtained, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in this study. Then the FCNCP algorithm was utilised to decompose the fifth-order event-related potential (ERP) tensor data collected by applying proprioceptive stimuli on the left and right hands. It was found that contralateral stimulation induced more symmetrical components in the activation areas of the left and right hemispheres. The conclusions drawn are consistent with the interpretations of related studies in cognitive neuroscience, demonstrating that the method can efficiently process higher-order EEG data and that some key hidden information can be preserved.</description>

      <title>TriForce: Lossless Acceleration of Long Sequence Generation with Hierarchical Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable to long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.</description>

      <title>Sketch-guided Image Inpainting with Partial Discrete Diffusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the task of sketch-guided image inpainting. Unlike the well-explored natural language-guided image inpainting, which excels in capturing semantic details, the relatively less-studied sketch-guided inpainting offers greater user control in specifying the object's shape and pose to be inpainted. As one of the early solutions to this task, we introduce a novel partial discrete diffusion process (PDDP). The forward pass of the PDDP corrupts the masked regions of the image and the backward pass reconstructs these masked regions conditioned on hand-drawn sketches using our proposed sketch-guided bi-directional transformer. The proposed novel transformer module accepts two inputs -- the image containing the masked region to be inpainted and the query sketch to model the reverse diffusion process. This strategy effectively addresses the domain gap between sketches and natural images, thereby, enhancing the quality of inpainting results. In the absence of a large-scale dataset specific to this task, we synthesize a dataset from the MS-COCO to train and extensively evaluate our proposed framework against various competent approaches in the literature. The qualitative and quantitative results and user studies establish that the proposed method inpaints realistic objects that fit the context in terms of the visual appearance of the provided sketch. To aid further research, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/vl2g/Sketch-Inpainting .</description>

      <title>\copyright Plug-in Authorization for Human Content Copyright Protection in Text-to-Image Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the contentious issue of copyright infringement in images generated by text-to-image models, sparking debates among AI developers, content creators, and legal entities. State-of-the-art models create high-quality content without crediting original creators, causing concern in the artistic community. To mitigate this, we propose the \copyright Plug-in Authorization framework, introducing three operations: addition, extraction, and combination. Addition involves training a \copyright plug-in for specific copyright, facilitating proper credit attribution. Extraction allows creators to reclaim copyright from infringing models, and combination enables users to merge different \copyright plug-ins. These operations act as permits, incentivizing fair use and providing flexibility in authorization. We present innovative approaches,"Reverse LoRA" for extraction and "EasyMerge" for seamless combination. Experiments in artist-style replication and cartoon IP recreation demonstrate \copyright plug-ins' effectiveness, offering a valuable solution for human copyright protection in the age of generative AIs.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity Gaussian process surrogate modeling for regression problems in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in surrogate modeling is the limited availability of data due to resource constraints associated with computationally expensive simulations. Multi-fidelity methods provide a solution by chaining models in a hierarchy with increasing fidelity, associated with lower error, but increasing cost. In this paper, we compare different multi-fidelity methods employed in constructing Gaussian process surrogates for regression. Non-linear autoregressive methods in the existing literature are primarily confined to two-fidelity models, and we extend these methods to handle more than two levels of fidelity. Additionally, we propose enhancements for an existing method incorporating delay terms by introducing a structured kernel. We demonstrate the performance of these methods across various academic and real-world scenarios. Our findings reveal that multi-fidelity methods generally have a smaller prediction error for the same computational cost as compared to the single-fidelity method, although their effectiveness varies across different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Aware Multi-Intent Contrastive Learning for Multi-Behavior Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-behavioral recommendation optimizes user experiences by providing users with more accurate choices based on their diverse behaviors, such as view, add to cart, and purchase. Current studies on multi-behavioral recommendation mainly explore the connections and differences between multi-behaviors from an implicit perspective. Specifically, they directly model those relations using black-box neural networks. In fact, users' interactions with items under different behaviors are driven by distinct intents. For instance, when users view products, they tend to pay greater attention to information such as ratings and brands. However, when it comes to the purchasing phase, users become more price-conscious. To tackle this challenge and data sparsity problem in the multi-behavioral recommendation, we propose a novel model: Knowledge-Aware Multi-Intent Contrastive Learning (KAMCL) model. This model uses relationships in the knowledge graph to construct intents, aiming to mine the connections between users' multi-behaviors from the perspective of intents to achieve more accurate recommendations. KAMCL is equipped with two contrastive learning schemes to alleviate the data scarcity problem and further enhance user representations. Extensive experiments on three real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.</description>

      <title>ParaFusion: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven English Paraphrase Dataset Infused with High-Quality Lexical and Syntactic Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paraphrase generation is a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP). Existing datasets in the domain lack syntactic and lexical diversity, resulting in paraphrases that closely resemble the source sentences. Moreover, these datasets often contain hate speech and noise, and may unintentionally include non-English language sentences. This research introduces ParaFusion, a large-scale, high-quality English paraphrase dataset developed using Large Language Models (LLM) to address these challenges. ParaFusion augments existing datasets with high-quality data, significantly enhancing both lexical and syntactic diversity while maintaining close semantic similarity. It also mitigates the presence of hate speech and reduces noise, ensuring a cleaner and more focused English dataset. Results show that ParaFusion offers at least a 25% improvement in both syntactic and lexical diversity, measured across several metrics for each data source. The paper also aims to set a gold standard for paraphrase evaluation as it contains one of the most comprehensive evaluation strategies to date. The results underscore the potential of ParaFusion as a valuable resource for improving NLP applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater Unmanned Vehicles (UUVs) have to constantly compensate for the external disturbing forces acting on their body. Adaptive Control theory is commonly used there to grant the control law some flexibility in its response to process variation. Today, learning-based (LB) adaptive methods are leading the field where model-based control structures are combined with deep model-free learning algorithms. This work proposes experiments and metrics to empirically study the stability of such a controller. We perform this stability analysis on a LB adaptive control system whose adaptive parameters are determined using a Cross-Entropy Deep Learning method.</description>

      <title>PureForest: A Large-scale Aerial Lidar and Aerial Imagery Dataset for Tree Species Classification in Monospecific Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge of tree species distribution is fundamental to managing forests. New deep learning approaches promise significant accuracy gains for forest mapping, and are becoming a critical tool for mapping multiple tree species at scale. To advance the field, deep learning researchers need large benchmark datasets with high-quality annotations. To this end, we present the PureForest dataset: a large-scale, open, multimodal dataset designed for tree species classification from both Aerial Lidar Scanning (ALS) point clouds and Very High Resolution (VHR) aerial images. Most current public Lidar datasets for tree species classification have low diversity as they only span a small area of a few dozen annotated hectares at most. In contrast, PureForest has 18 tree species grouped into 13 semantic classes, and spans 339 km$^2$ across 449 distinct monospecific forests, and is to date the largest and most comprehensive Lidar dataset for the identification of tree species. By making PureForest publicly available, we hope to provide a challenging benchmark dataset to support the development of deep learning approaches for tree species identification from Lidar and/or aerial imagery. In this data paper, we describe the annotation workflow, the dataset, the recommended evaluation methodology, and establish a baseline performance from both 3D and 2D modalities.</description>

      <title>Towards an Approximation Theory of Observable Operator Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observable operator models (OOMs) offer a powerful framework for modelling stochastic processes, surpassing the traditional hidden Markov models (HMMs) in generality and efficiency. However, using OOMs to model infinite-dimensional processes poses significant theoretical challenges. This article explores a rigorous approach to developing an approximation theory for OOMs of infinite-dimensional processes. Building upon foundational work outlined in an unpublished tutorial [Jae98], an inner product structure on the space of future distributions is rigorously established and the continuity of observable operators with respect to the associated 2-norm is proven. The original theorem proven in this thesis describes a fundamental obstacle in making an infinite-dimensional space of future distributions into a Hilbert space. The presented findings lay the groundwork for future research in approximating observable operators of infinite-dimensional processes, while a remedy to the encountered obstacle is suggested.</description>

      <title>TIMIT Speaker Profiling: A Comparison of Multi-task learning and Single-task learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs deep learning techniques to explore four speaker profiling tasks on the TIMIT dataset, namely gender classification, accent classification, age estimation, and speaker identification, highlighting the potential and challenges of multi-task learning versus single-task models. The motivation for this research is twofold: firstly, to empirically assess the advantages and drawbacks of multi-task learning over single-task models in the context of speaker profiling; secondly, to emphasize the undiminished significance of skillful feature engineering for speaker recognition tasks. The findings reveal challenges in accent classification, and multi-task learning is found advantageous for tasks of similar complexity. Non-sequential features are favored for speaker recognition, but sequential ones can serve as starting points for complex models. The study underscores the necessity of meticulous experimentation and parameter tuning for deep learning models.</description>

      <title>LongEmbed: Extending Embedding Models for Long Context Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding models play a pivot role in modern NLP applications such as IR and RAG. While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens, embedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k tokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as legal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing embedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional training. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for long context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed comprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks, featuring documents of varying length and dispersed target information. Benchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models. Based on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window extension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the context window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of their original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models employing absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further fine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving original behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding (RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific methods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for context window extension. To facilitate future research, we release E5-Base-4k and E5-RoPE-Base, along with the LongEmbed benchmark.</description>

      <title>MPC of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems with Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Neural Predictive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of reference tracking in uncertain nonlinear systems. A neural State-Space Model (NSSM) is used to approximate the nonlinear system, where a deep encoder network learns the nonlinearity from data, and a state-space component captures the temporal relationship. This transforms the nonlinear system into a linear system in a latent space, enabling the application of model predictive control (MPC) to determine effective control actions. Our objective is to design the optimal controller using limited data from the \textit{target system} (the system of interest). To this end, we employ an implicit model-agnostic meta-learning (iMAML) framework that leverages information from \textit{source systems} (systems that share similarities with the target system) to expedite training in the target system and enhance its control performance. The framework consists of two phases: the (offine) meta-training phase learns a aggregated NSSM using data from source systems, and the (online) meta-inference phase quickly adapts this aggregated model to the target system using only a few data points and few online training iterations, based on local loss function gradients. The iMAML algorithm exploits the implicit function theorem to exactly compute the gradient during training, without relying on the entire optimization path. By focusing solely on the optimal solution, rather than the path, we can meta-train with less storage complexity and fewer approximations than other contemporary meta-learning algorithms. We demonstrate through numerical examples that our proposed method can yield accurate predictive models by adaptation, resulting in a downstream MPC that outperforms several baselines.</description>

      <title>Ethical-Lens: Curbing Malicious Usages of Open-Source Text-to-Image Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning landscape of text-to-image models, exemplified by innovations such as Midjourney and DALLE 3, has revolutionized content creation across diverse sectors. However, these advancements bring forth critical ethical concerns, particularly with the misuse of open-source models to generate content that violates societal norms. Addressing this, we introduce Ethical-Lens, a framework designed to facilitate the value-aligned usage of text-to-image tools without necessitating internal model revision. Ethical-Lens ensures value alignment in text-to-image models across toxicity and bias dimensions by refining user commands and rectifying model outputs. Systematic evaluation metrics, combining GPT4-V, HEIM, and FairFace scores, assess alignment capability. Our experiments reveal that Ethical-Lens enhances alignment capabilities to levels comparable with or superior to commercial models like DALLE 3, ensuring user-generated content adheres to ethical standards while maintaining image quality. This study indicates the potential of Ethical-Lens to ensure the sustainable development of open-source text-to-image tools and their beneficial integration into society. Our code is available at https://github.com/yuzhu-cai/Ethical-Lens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models for structure-based drug design (SBDD) have shown promising results in recent years. Existing works mainly focus on how to generate molecules with higher binding affinity, ignoring the feasibility prerequisites for generated 3D poses and resulting in false positives. We conduct thorough studies on key factors of ill-conformational problems when applying autoregressive methods and diffusion to SBDD, including mode collapse and hybrid continuous-discrete space. In this paper, we introduce \ours, the first SBDD model that operates in the continuous parameter space, together with a novel noise reduced sampling strategy. Empirical results show that our model consistently achieves superior performance in binding affinity with more stable 3D structure, demonstrating our ability to accurately model interatomic interactions. To our best knowledge, MolCRAFT is the first to achieve reference-level Vina Scores (-6.59 kcal/mol), outperforming other strong baselines by a wide margin (-0.84 kcal/mol).

      <title>SDIP: Self-Reinforcement Deep Image Prior Framework for Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep image prior (DIP) proposed in recent research has revealed the inherent trait of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for capturing substantial low-level image statistics priors. This framework efficiently addresses the inverse problems in image processing and has induced extensive applications in various domains. However, as the whole algorithm is initialized randomly, the DIP algorithm often lacks stability. Thus, this method still has space for further improvement. In this paper, we propose the self-reinforcement deep image prior (SDIP) as an improved version of the original DIP. We observed that the changes in the DIP networks' input and output are highly correlated during each iteration. SDIP efficiently utilizes this trait in a reinforcement learning manner, where the current iteration's output is utilized by a steering algorithm to update the network input for the next iteration, guiding the algorithm toward improved results. Experimental results across multiple applications demonstrate that our proposed SDIP framework offers improvement compared to the original DIP method and other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>How to Benchmark Vision Foundation Models for Semantic Segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated proficiency in various tasks but require supervised fine-tuning to perform the task of semantic segmentation effectively. Benchmarking their performance is essential for selecting current models and guiding future model developments for this task. The lack of a standardized benchmark complicates comparisons. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to study how VFMs should be benchmarked for semantic segmentation. To do so, various VFMs are fine-tuned under various settings, and the impact of individual settings on the performance ranking and training time is assessed. Based on the results, the recommendation is to fine-tune the ViT-B variants of VFMs with a 16x16 patch size and a linear decoder, as these settings are representative of using a larger model, more advanced decoder and smaller patch size, while reducing training time by more than 13 times. Using multiple datasets for training and evaluation is also recommended, as the performance ranking across datasets and domain shifts varies. Linear probing, a common practice for some VFMs, is not recommended, as it is not representative of end-to-end fine-tuning. The benchmarking setup recommended in this paper enables a performance analysis of VFMs for semantic segmentation. The findings of such an analysis reveal that pretraining with promptable segmentation is not beneficial, whereas masked image modeling (MIM) with abstract representations is crucial, even more important than the type of supervision used. The code for efficiently fine-tuning VFMs for semantic segmentation can be accessed through the project page at: https://tue-mps.github.io/benchmark-vfm-ss/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing predictive controllers towards optimal closed-loop performance while maintaining safety and stability is challenging. This work explores closed-loop learning for predictive control parameters under imperfect information while considering closed-loop stability. We employ constrained Bayesian optimization to learn a model predictive controller's (MPC) cost function parametrized as a feedforward neural network, optimizing closed-loop behavior as well as minimizing model-plant mismatch. Doing so offers a high degree of freedom and, thus, the opportunity for efficient and global optimization towards the desired and optimal closed-loop behavior. We extend this framework by stability constraints on the learned controller parameters, exploiting the optimal value function of the underlying MPC as a Lyapunov candidate. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is underlined in simulations, highlighting its performance and safety capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning pretrained LLMs for diverse downstream tasks has demonstrated remarkable success and has captured the interest of both academics and practitioners. To ensure such fine-tuned LLMs align with human preferences, techniques such as RLHF and DPO have emerged. At the same time, there is increasing interest in smaller parameter counts for models. In this work, using OpenLLaMA 3Bv2 as a base model, we describe the recipe used to fine-tune the OpenBezoar family of models. In this recipe: We first generate synthetic instruction fine-tuning data using an open and commercially non-restrictive instruction fine-tuned variant of the Falcon-40B model under three schemes based on: LaMini-LM, WizardLM/Evol-Instruct (with databricks-dolly-15k as a seed dataset) and Orca (with the Flan Collection as a seed dataset), then filter these generations using GPT-4 as a human proxy. We then perform cost-effective QLoRA-based supervised fine-tuning sequentially with each scheme. The resulting checkpoint is further fine-tuned with a subset of the HH-RLHF dataset to minimize distribution shift prior to using the DPO loss to obtain the final checkpoint. Evaluation is done with the LM Eval Harness tasks/metrics as well as on MT-Bench using the "LLM-as-a-judge" framework with Claude 2.1, with the finding that the final checkpoint, "OpenBezoar-HH-RLHF-DPO", demonstrates superior performance over many models at the 3B parameter scale, even outperforming the top model in one of the categories on the Huggingface Open LLM Leaderboard. We release "OpenBezoar-SFT", "OpenBezoar-HH-RLHF-SFT", "OpenBezoar-HH-RLHF-DPO" checkpoints, alongside our generated datasets on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/collections/SurgeGlobal/open-bezoar-6620a24923e12127e9e2b9cc and our codebase at https://bitbucket.org/paladinanalytics/workspace/projects/OP.</description>

Abstract: Medication recommendation systems are designed to deliver personalized drug suggestions that are closely aligned with individual patient needs. Previous studies have primarily concentrated on developing medication embeddings, achieving significant progress. Nonetheless, these approaches often fall short in accurately reflecting individual patient profiles, mainly due to challenges in distinguishing between various patient conditions and the inability to establish precise correlations between specific conditions and appropriate medications. In response to these issues, we introduce DisMed, a model that focuses on patient conditions to enhance personalization. DisMed employs causal inference to discern clear, quantifiable causal links. It then examines patient conditions in depth, recognizing and adapting to the evolving nuances of these conditions, and mapping them directly to corresponding medications. Additionally, DisMed leverages data from multiple patient visits to propose combinations of medications. Comprehensive testing on real-world datasets demonstrates that DisMed not only improves the customization of patient profiles but also surpasses leading models in both precision and safety.</description>

      <title>An Online Spatial-Temporal Graph Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Vehicles</title>

Abstract: The autonomous driving industry is expected to grow by over 20 times in the coming decade and, thus, motivate researchers to delve into it. The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride.</description>

      <title>Food Portion Estimation via 3D Object Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-based methods to analyze food images have alleviated the user burden and biases associated with traditional methods. However, accurate portion estimation remains a major challenge due to the loss of 3D information in the 2D representation of foods captured by smartphone cameras or wearable devices. In this paper, we propose a new framework to estimate both food volume and energy from 2D images by leveraging the power of 3D food models and physical reference in the eating scene. Our method estimates the pose of the camera and the food object in the input image and recreates the eating occasion by rendering an image of a 3D model of the food with the estimated poses. We also introduce a new dataset, SimpleFood45, which contains 2D images of 45 food items and associated annotations including food volume, weight, and energy. Our method achieves an average error of 31.10 kCal (17.67%) on this dataset, outperforming existing portion estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Catastrophic Forgetting in Facial Expression Recognition with Emotion-Centered Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facial expression recognition is a pivotal component in machine learning, facilitating various applications. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often plagued by catastrophic forgetting, impeding their adaptability. The proposed method, emotion-centered generative replay (ECgr), tackles this challenge by integrating synthetic images from generative adversarial networks. Moreover, ECgr incorporates a quality assurance algorithm to ensure the fidelity of generated images. This dual approach enables CNNs to retain past knowledge while learning new tasks, enhancing their performance in emotion recognition. The experimental results on four diverse facial expression datasets demonstrate that incorporating images generated by our pseudo-rehearsal method enhances training on the targeted dataset and the source dataset while making the CNN retain previously learned knowledge.</description>

      <title>FedEval-LLM: Federated Evaluation of Large Language Models on Downstream Tasks with Collective Wisdom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for collaborative training of large language models (LLMs). However, the integration of LLMs into FL introduces new challenges, particularly concerning the evaluation of LLMs. Traditional evaluation methods that rely on labeled test sets and similarity-based metrics cover only a subset of the acceptable answers, thereby failing to accurately reflect the performance of LLMs on generative tasks. Meanwhile, although automatic evaluation methods that leverage advanced LLMs present potential, they face critical risks of data leakage due to the need to transmit data to external servers and suboptimal performance on downstream tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a Federated Evaluation framework of Large Language Models, named FedEval-LLM, that provides reliable performance measurements of LLMs on downstream tasks without the reliance on labeled test sets and external tools, thus ensuring strong privacy-preserving capability. FedEval-LLM leverages a consortium of personalized LLMs from participants as referees to provide domain knowledge and collective evaluation capability, thus aligning to the respective downstream tasks and mitigating uncertainties and biases associated with a single referee. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in the evaluation capability of personalized evaluation models on downstream tasks. When applied to FL, these evaluation models exhibit strong agreement with human preference and RougeL-score on meticulously curated test sets. FedEval-LLM effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional metrics and the reliance on external services, making it a promising framework for the evaluation of LLMs within collaborative training scenarios.</description>

      <title>Debiased Distribution Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern compression methods can summarize a target distribution $\mathbb{P}$ more succinctly than i.i.d. sampling but require access to a low-bias input sequence like a Markov chain converging quickly to $\mathbb{P}$. We introduce a new suite of compression methods suitable for compression with biased input sequences. Given $n$ points targeting the wrong distribution and quadratic time, Stein Kernel Thinning (SKT) returns $\sqrt{n}$ equal-weighted points with $\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/2})$ maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to $\mathbb {P}$. For larger-scale compression tasks, Low-rank SKT achieves the same feat in sub-quadratic time using an adaptive low-rank debiasing procedure that may be of independent interest. For downstream tasks that support simplex or constant-preserving weights, Stein Recombination and Stein Cholesky achieve even greater parsimony, matching the guarantees of SKT with as few as $\operatorname{poly-log}(n)$ weighted points. Underlying these advances are new guarantees for the quality of simplex-weighted coresets, the spectral decay of kernel matrices, and the covering numbers of Stein kernel Hilbert spaces. In our experiments, our techniques provide succinct and accurate posterior summaries while overcoming biases due to burn-in, approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo, and tempering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method (floZ), based on normalizing flows, for estimating the Bayesian evidence (and its numerical uncertainty) from a set of samples drawn from the unnormalized posterior distribution. We validate it on distributions whose evidence is known analytically, up to 15 parameter space dimensions, and compare with two state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the evidence: nested sampling (which computes the evidence as its main target) and a k-nearest-neighbors technique that produces evidence estimates from posterior samples. Provided representative samples from the target posterior are available, our method is more robust to posterior distributions with sharp features, especially in higher dimensions. It has wide applicability, e.g., to estimate the evidence from variational inference, Markov-chain Monte Carlo samples, or any other method that delivers samples from the unnormalized posterior density.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Interpretation Corpus Construction by Large Language Models in Distant Language Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) systems, training with a simultaneous interpretation (SI) corpus is an effective method for achieving high-quality yet low-latency systems. However, it is very challenging to curate such a corpus due to limitations in the abilities of annotators, and hence, existing SI corpora are limited. Therefore, we propose a method to convert existing speech translation corpora into interpretation-style data, maintaining the original word order and preserving the entire source content using Large Language Models (LLM-SI-Corpus). We demonstrate that fine-tuning SiMT models in text-to-text and speech-to-text settings with the LLM-SI-Corpus reduces latencies while maintaining the same level of quality as the models trained with offline datasets. The LLM-SI-Corpus is available at \url{https://github.com/yusuke1997/LLM-SI-Corpus}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-free control strategies such as reinforcement learning have shown the ability to learn control strategies without requiring an accurate model or simulator of the world. While this is appealing due to the lack of modeling requirements, such methods can be sample inefficient, making them impractical in many real-world domains. On the other hand, model-based control techniques leveraging accurate simulators can circumvent these challenges and use a large amount of cheap simulation data to learn controllers that can effectively transfer to the real world. The challenge with such model-based techniques is the requirement for an extremely accurate simulation, requiring both the specification of appropriate simulation assets and physical parameters. This requires considerable human effort to design for every environment being considered. In this work, we propose a learning system that can leverage a small amount of real-world data to autonomously refine a simulation model and then plan an accurate control strategy that can be deployed in the real world. Our approach critically relies on utilizing an initial (possibly inaccurate) simulator to design effective exploration policies that, when deployed in the real world, collect high-quality data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this paradigm in identifying articulation, mass, and other physical parameters in several challenging robotic manipulation tasks, and illustrate that only a small amount of real-world data can allow for effective sim-to-real transfer.

      <title>iRAG: An Incremental Retrieval Augmented Generation System for Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems combine the strengths of language generation and information retrieval to power many real-world applications like chatbots. Use of RAG for combined understanding of multimodal data such as text, images and videos is appealing but two critical limitations exist: one-time, upfront capture of all content in large multimodal data as text descriptions entails high processing times, and not all information in the rich multimodal data is typically in the text descriptions. Since the user queries are not known apriori, developing a system for multimodal to text conversion and interactive querying of multimodal data is challenging.
  To address these limitations, we propose iRAG, which augments RAG with a novel incremental workflow to enable interactive querying of large corpus of multimodal data. Unlike traditional RAG, iRAG quickly indexes large repositories of multimodal data, and in the incremental workflow, it uses the index to opportunistically extract more details from select portions of the multimodal data to retrieve context relevant to an interactive user query. Such an incremental workflow avoids long multimodal to text conversion times, overcomes information loss issues by doing on-demand query-specific extraction of details in multimodal data, and ensures high quality of responses to interactive user queries that are often not known apriori. To the best of our knowledge, iRAG is the first system to augment RAG with an incremental workflow to support efficient interactive querying of large, real-world multimodal data. Experimental results on real-world long videos demonstrate 23x to 25x faster video to text ingestion, while ensuring that quality of responses to interactive user queries is comparable to responses from a traditional RAG where all video data is converted to text upfront before any querying.</description>

      <title>Improving the interpretability of GNN predictions through conformal-based graph sparsification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in solving graph classification tasks. However, most GNN architectures aggregate information from all nodes and edges in a graph, regardless of their relevance to the task at hand, thus hindering the interpretability of their predictions. In contrast to prior work, in this paper we propose a GNN \emph{training} approach that jointly i) finds the most predictive subgraph by removing edges and/or nodes -- -\emph{without making assumptions about the subgraph structure} -- while ii) optimizing the performance of the graph classification task. To that end, we rely on reinforcement learning to solve the resulting bi-level optimization with a reward function based on conformal predictions to account for the current in-training uncertainty of the classifier. Our empirical results on nine different graph classification datasets show that our method competes in performance with baselines while relying on significantly sparser subgraphs, leading to more interpretable GNN-based predictions.</description>

Abstract: We present FastFit, a method, and a Python package design to provide fast and accurate few-shot classification, especially for scenarios with many semantically similar classes. FastFit utilizes a novel approach integrating batch contrastive learning and token-level similarity score. Compared to existing few-shot learning packages, such as SetFit, Transformers, or few-shot prompting of large language models via API calls, FastFit significantly improves multiclass classification performance in speed and accuracy across FewMany, our newly curated English benchmark, and Multilingual datasets. FastFit demonstrates a 3-20x improvement in training speed, completing training in just a few seconds. The FastFit package is now available on GitHub and PyPi, presenting a user-friendly solution for NLP practitioners.</description>

      <title>Information theory unifies atomistic machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and materials thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate description of information is relevant for a range of problems in atomistic modeling, such as sampling methods, detecting rare events, analyzing datasets, or performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning (ML)-driven simulations. Although individual methods have been proposed for each of these tasks, they lack a common theoretical background integrating their solutions. Here, we introduce an information theoretical framework that unifies predictions of phase transformations, kinetic events, dataset optimality, and model-free UQ from atomistic simulations, thus bridging materials modeling, ML, and statistical mechanics. We first demonstrate that, for a proposed representation, the information entropy of a distribution of atom-centered environments is a surrogate value for thermodynamic entropy. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that information entropy differences from trajectories can be used to build phase diagrams, identify rare events, and recover classical theories of nucleation. Building on these results, we use this general concept of entropy to quantify information in datasets for ML interatomic potentials (IPs), informing compression, explaining trends in testing errors, and evaluating the efficiency of active learning strategies. Finally, we propose a model-free UQ method for MLIPs using information entropy, showing it reliably detects extrapolation regimes, scales to millions of atoms, and goes beyond model errors. This method is made available as the package QUESTS: Quick Uncertainty and Entropy via STructural Similarity, providing a new unifying theory for data-driven atomistic modeling and combining efforts in ML, first-principles thermodynamics, and simulations.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Regularized Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the challenges for neural networks in real-life applications is the overconfident errors these models make when the data is not from the original training distribution.
  Addressing this issue is known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection.
  Many state-of-the-art OOD methods employ an auxiliary dataset as a surrogate for OOD data during training to achieve improved performance.
  However, these methods fail to fully exploit the local information embedded in the auxiliary dataset.
  In this work, we propose the idea of leveraging the information embedded in the gradient of the loss function during training to enable the network to not only learn a desired OOD score for each sample but also to exhibit similar behavior in a local neighborhood around each sample.
  We also develop a novel energy-based sampling method to allow the network to be exposed to more informative OOD samples during the training phase. This is especially important when the auxiliary dataset is large. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks, improving the existing state-of-the-art FPR95 by 4% on our ImageNet experiment.
  We further provide a theoretical analysis through the lens of certified robustness and Lipschitz analysis to showcase the theoretical foundation of our work. We will publicly release our code after the review process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current 3D reconstruction techniques struggle to infer unbounded scenes from a few images faithfully. Specifically, existing methods have high computational demands, require detailed pose information, and cannot reconstruct occluded regions reliably. We introduce 6Img-to-3D, an efficient, scalable transformer-based encoder-renderer method for single-shot image to 3D reconstruction. Our method outputs a 3D-consistent parameterized triplane from only six outward-facing input images for large-scale, unbounded outdoor driving scenarios. We take a step towards resolving existing shortcomings by combining contracted custom cross- and self-attention mechanisms for triplane parameterization, differentiable volume rendering, scene contraction, and image feature projection. We showcase that six surround-view vehicle images from a single timestamp without global pose information are enough to reconstruct 360$^{\circ}$ scenes during inference time, taking 395 ms. Our method allows, for example, rendering third-person images and birds-eye views. Our code is available at https://github.com/continental/6Img-to-3D, and more examples can be found at our website here https://6Img-to-3D.GitHub.io/.</description>

Abstract: Open-world entity segmentation, as an emerging computer vision task, aims at segmenting entities in images without being restricted by pre-defined classes, offering impressive generalization capabilities on unseen images and concepts. Despite its promise, existing entity segmentation methods like Segment Anything Model (SAM) rely heavily on costly expert annotators. This work presents Self-supervised Open-world Hierarchical Entity Segmentation (SOHES), a novel approach that eliminates the need for human annotations. SOHES operates in three phases: self-exploration, self-instruction, and self-correction. Given a pre-trained self-supervised representation, we produce abundant high-quality pseudo-labels through visual feature clustering. Then, we train a segmentation model on the pseudo-labels, and rectify the noises in pseudo-labels via a teacher-student mutual-learning procedure. Beyond segmenting entities, SOHES also captures their constituent parts, providing a hierarchical understanding of visual entities. Using raw images as the sole training data, our method achieves unprecedented performance in self-supervised open-world segmentation, marking a significant milestone towards high-quality open-world entity segmentation in the absence of human-annotated masks.

      <title>On the Content Bias in Fr\'echet Video Distance</title>

Abstract: Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), a prominent metric for evaluating video generation models, is known to conflict with human perception occasionally. In this paper, we aim to explore the extent of FVD's bias toward per-frame quality over temporal realism and identify its sources. We first quantify the FVD's sensitivity to the temporal axis by decoupling the frame and motion quality and find that the FVD increases only slightly with large temporal corruption. We then analyze the generated videos and show that via careful sampling from a large set of generated videos that do not contain motions, one can drastically decrease FVD without improving the temporal quality. Both studies suggest FVD's bias towards the quality of individual frames. We further observe that the bias can be attributed to the features extracted from a supervised video classifier trained on the content-biased dataset. We show that FVD with features extracted from the recent large-scale self-supervised video models is less biased toward image quality. Finally, we revisit a few real-world examples to validate our hypothesis.</description>

      <title>t-viSNE: Interactive Assessment and Interpretation of t-SNE Projections</title>

Abstract: t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for the visualization of multidimensional data has proven to be a popular approach, with successful applications in a wide range of domains. Despite their usefulness, t-SNE projections can be hard to interpret or even misleading, which hurts the trustworthiness of the results. Understanding the details of t-SNE itself and the reasons behind specific patterns in its output may be a daunting task, especially for non-experts in dimensionality reduction. In this work, we present t-viSNE, an interactive tool for the visual exploration of t-SNE projections that enables analysts to inspect different aspects of their accuracy and meaning, such as the effects of hyper-parameters, distance and neighborhood preservation, densities and costs of specific neighborhoods, and the correlations between dimensions and visual patterns. We propose a coherent, accessible, and well-integrated collection of different views for the visualization of t-SNE projections. The applicability and usability of t-viSNE are demonstrated through hypothetical usage scenarios with real data sets. Finally, we present the results of a user study where the tool's effectiveness was evaluated. By bringing to light information that would normally be lost after running t-SNE, we hope to support analysts in using t-SNE and making its results better understandable.</description>

      <title>VisEvol: Visual Analytics to Support Hyperparameter Search through Evolutionary Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.01205v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the training phase of machine learning (ML) models, it is usually necessary to configure several hyperparameters. This process is computationally intensive and requires an extensive search to infer the best hyperparameter set for the given problem. The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that most ML models are complex internally, and training involves trial-and-error processes that could remarkably affect the predictive result. Moreover, each hyperparameter of an ML algorithm is potentially intertwined with the others, and changing it might result in unforeseeable impacts on the remaining hyperparameters. Evolutionary optimization is a promising method to try and address those issues. According to this method, performant models are stored, while the remainder are improved through crossover and mutation processes inspired by genetic algorithms. We present VisEvol, a visual analytics tool that supports interactive exploration of hyperparameters and intervention in this evolutionary procedure. In summary, our proposed tool helps the user to generate new models through evolution and eventually explore powerful hyperparameter combinations in diverse regions of the extensive hyperparameter space. The outcome is a voting ensemble (with equal rights) that boosts the final predictive performance. The utility and applicability of VisEvol are demonstrated with two use cases and interviews with ML experts who evaluated the effectiveness of the tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.14539v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The machine learning (ML) life cycle involves a series of iterative steps, from the effective gathering and preparation of the data, including complex feature engineering processes, to the presentation and improvement of results, with various algorithms to choose from in every step. Feature engineering in particular can be very beneficial for ML, leading to numerous improvements such as boosting the predictive results, decreasing computational times, reducing excessive noise, and increasing the transparency behind the decisions taken during the training. Despite that, while several visual analytics tools exist to monitor and control the different stages of the ML life cycle (especially those related to data and algorithms), feature engineering support remains inadequate. In this paper, we present FeatureEnVi, a visual analytics system specifically designed to assist with the feature engineering process. Our proposed system helps users to choose the most important feature, to transform the original features into powerful alternatives, and to experiment with different feature generation combinations. Additionally, data space slicing allows users to explore the impact of features on both local and global scales. FeatureEnVi utilizes multiple automatic feature selection techniques; furthermore, it visually guides users with statistical evidence about the influence of each feature (or subsets of features). The final outcome is the extraction of heavily engineered features, evaluated by multiple validation metrics. The usefulness and applicability of FeatureEnVi are demonstrated with two use cases and a case study. We also report feedback from interviews with two ML experts and a visualization researcher who assessed the effectiveness of our system.</description>

      <title>VisRuler: Visual Analytics for Extracting Decision Rules from Bagged and Boosted Decision Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.00334v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bagging and boosting are two popular ensemble methods in machine learning (ML) that produce many individual decision trees. Due to the inherent ensemble characteristic of these methods, they typically outperform single decision trees or other ML models in predictive performance. However, numerous decision paths are generated for each decision tree, increasing the overall complexity of the model and hindering its use in domains that require trustworthy and explainable decisions, such as finance, social care, and health care. Thus, the interpretability of bagging and boosting algorithms, such as random forest and adaptive boosting, reduces as the number of decisions rises. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics tool that aims to assist users in extracting decisions from such ML models via a thorough visual inspection workflow that includes selecting a set of robust and diverse models (originating from different ensemble learning algorithms), choosing important features according to their global contribution, and deciding which decisions are essential for global explanation (or locally, for specific cases). The outcome is a final decision based on the class agreement of several models and the explored manual decisions exported by users. We evaluated the applicability and effectiveness of VisRuler via a use case, a usage scenario, and a user study. The evaluation revealed that most users managed to successfully use our system to explore decision rules visually, performing the proposed tasks and answering the given questions in a satisfying way.</description>

      <title>HardVis: Visual Analytics to Handle Instance Hardness Using Undersampling and Oversampling Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15753v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous advances in machine learning (ML), training with imbalanced data still poses challenges in many real-world applications. Among a series of diverse techniques to solve this problem, sampling algorithms are regarded as an efficient solution. However, the problem is more fundamental, with many works emphasizing the importance of instance hardness. This issue refers to the significance of managing unsafe or potentially noisy instances that are more likely to be misclassified and serve as the root cause of poor classification performance. This paper introduces HardVis, a visual analytics system designed to handle instance hardness mainly in imbalanced classification scenarios. Our proposed system assists users in visually comparing different distributions of data types, selecting types of instances based on local characteristics that will later be affected by the active sampling method, and validating which suggestions from undersampling or oversampling techniques are beneficial for the ML model. Additionally, rather than uniformly undersampling/oversampling a specific class, we allow users to find and sample easy and difficult to classify training instances from all classes. Users can explore subsets of data from different perspectives to decide all those parameters, while HardVis keeps track of their steps and evaluates the model's predictive performance in a test set separately. The end result is a well-balanced data set that boosts the predictive power of the ML model. The efficacy and effectiveness of HardVis are demonstrated with a hypothetical usage scenario and a use case. Finally, we also look at how useful our system is based on feedback we received from ML experts.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the tradeoffs between the time and the number of communication rounds of the best arm identification problem in the heterogeneous collaborative learning model, where multiple agents interact with possibly different environments and they want to learn in parallel an objective function in the aggregated environment. By proving almost tight upper and lower bounds, we show that collaborative learning in the heterogeneous setting is inherently more difficult than that in the homogeneous setting in terms of the time-round tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Transferability Ranking of Adversarial Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial transferability in black-box scenarios presents a unique challenge: while attackers can employ surrogate models to craft adversarial examples, they lack assurance on whether these examples will successfully compromise the target model. Until now, the prevalent method to ascertain success has been trial and error-testing crafted samples directly on the victim model. This approach, however, risks detection with every attempt, forcing attackers to either perfect their first try or face exposure. Our paper introduces a ranking strategy that refines the transfer attack process, enabling the attacker to estimate the likelihood of success without repeated trials on the victim's system. By leveraging a set of diverse surrogate models, our method can predict transferability of adversarial examples. This strategy can be used to either select the best sample to use in an attack or the best perturbation to apply to a specific sample. Using our strategy, we were able to raise the transferability of adversarial examples from a mere 20% - akin to random selection-up to near upper-bound levels, with some scenarios even witnessing a 100% success rate. This substantial improvement not only sheds light on the shared susceptibilities across diverse architectures but also demonstrates that attackers can forego the detectable trial-and-error tactics raising increasing the threat of surrogate-based attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online learning (OL) from data streams is an emerging area of research that encompasses numerous challenges from stream processing, machine learning, and networking. Stream-processing platforms, such as Apache Kafka and Flink, have basic extensions for the training of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in a stream-processing pipeline. However, these extensions were not designed to train ANNs in real-time, and they suffer from performance and scalability issues when doing so. This paper presents TensAIR, the first OL system for training ANNs in real time. TensAIR achieves remarkable performance and scalability by using a decentralized and asynchronous architecture to train ANN models (either freshly initialized or pre-trained) via DASGD (decentralized and asynchronous stochastic gradient descent). We empirically demonstrate that TensAIR achieves a nearly linear scale-out performance in terms of (1) the number of worker nodes deployed in the network, and (2) the throughput at which the data batches arrive at the dataflow operators. We depict the versatility of TensAIR by investigating both sparse (word embedding) and dense (image classification) use cases, for which TensAIR achieved from 6 to 116 times higher sustainable throughput rates than state-of-the-art systems for training ANN in a stream-processing pipeline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stacking (or stacked generalization) is an ensemble learning method with one main distinctiveness from the rest: even though several base models are trained on the original data set, their predictions are further used as input data for one or more metamodels arranged in at least one extra layer. Composing a stack of models can produce high-performance outcomes, but it usually involves a trial-and-error process. Therefore, our previously developed visual analytics system, StackGenVis, was mainly designed to assist users in choosing a set of top-performing and diverse models by measuring their predictive performance. However, it only employs a single logistic regression metamodel. In this paper, we investigate the impact of alternative metamodels on the performance of stacking ensembles using a novel visualization tool, called MetaStackVis. Our interactive tool helps users to visually explore different singular and pairs of metamodels according to their predictive probabilities and multiple validation metrics, as well as their ability to predict specific problematic data instances. MetaStackVis was evaluated with a usage scenario based on a medical data set and via expert interviews.</description>

      <title>The State of the Art in Enhancing Trust in Machine Learning Models with the Use of Visualizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are nowadays used in complex applications in various domains, such as medicine, bioinformatics, and other sciences. Due to their black box nature, however, it may sometimes be hard to understand and trust the results they provide. This has increased the demand for reliable visualization tools related to enhancing trust in ML models, which has become a prominent topic of research in the visualization community over the past decades. To provide an overview and present the frontiers of current research on the topic, we present a State-of-the-Art Report (STAR) on enhancing trust in ML models with the use of interactive visualization. We define and describe the background of the topic, introduce a categorization for visualization techniques that aim to accomplish this goal, and discuss insights and opportunities for future research directions. Among our contributions is a categorization of trust against different facets of interactive ML, expanded and improved from previous research. Our results are investigated from different analytical perspectives: (a) providing a statistical overview, (b) summarizing key findings, (c) performing topic analyses, and (d) exploring the data sets used in the individual papers, all with the support of an interactive web-based survey browser. We intend this survey to be beneficial for visualization researchers whose interests involve making ML models more trustworthy, as well as researchers and practitioners from other disciplines in their search for effective visualization techniques suitable for solving their tasks with confidence and conveying meaning to their data.</description>

      <title>One-shot Empirical Privacy Estimation for Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03098v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy estimation techniques for differentially private (DP) algorithms are useful for comparing against analytical bounds, or to empirically measure privacy loss in settings where known analytical bounds are not tight. However, existing privacy auditing techniques usually make strong assumptions on the adversary (e.g., knowledge of intermediate model iterates or the training data distribution), are tailored to specific tasks, model architectures, or DP algorithm, and/or require retraining the model many times (typically on the order of thousands). These shortcomings make deploying such techniques at scale difficult in practice, especially in federated settings where model training can take days or weeks. In this work, we present a novel "one-shot" approach that can systematically address these challenges, allowing efficient auditing or estimation of the privacy loss of a model during the same, single training run used to fit model parameters, and without requiring any a priori knowledge about the model architecture, task, or DP training algorithm. We show that our method provides provably correct estimates for the privacy loss under the Gaussian mechanism, and we demonstrate its performance on well-established FL benchmark datasets under several adversarial threat models.</description>

      <title>Learning time-scales in two-layers neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient-based learning in multi-layer neural networks displays a number of striking features. In particular, the decrease rate of empirical risk is non-monotone even after averaging over large batches. Long plateaus in which one observes barely any progress alternate with intervals of rapid decrease. These successive phases of learning often take place on very different time scales. Finally, models learnt in an early phase are typically `simpler' or `easier to learn' although in a way that is difficult to formalize.
  Although theoretical explanations of these phenomena have been put forward, each of them captures at best certain specific regimes. In this paper, we study the gradient flow dynamics of a wide two-layer neural network in high-dimension, when data are distributed according to a single-index model (i.e., the target function depends on a one-dimensional projection of the covariates). Based on a mixture of new rigorous results, non-rigorous mathematical derivations, and numerical simulations, we propose a scenario for the learning dynamics in this setting. In particular, the proposed evolution exhibits separation of timescales and intermittency. These behaviors arise naturally because the population gradient flow can be recast as a singularly perturbed dynamical system.</description>

Abstract: As the complexity of machine learning (ML) models increases and their application in different (and critical) domains grows, there is a strong demand for more interpretable and trustworthy ML. A direct, model-agnostic, way to interpret such models is to train surrogate models-such as rule sets and decision trees-that sufficiently approximate the original ones while being simpler and easier-to-explain. Yet, rule sets can become very lengthy, with many if-else statements, and decision tree depth grows rapidly when accurately emulating complex ML models. In such cases, both approaches can fail to meet their core goal-providing users with model interpretability. To tackle this, we propose DeforestVis, a visual analytics tool that offers summarization of the behaviour of complex ML models by providing surrogate decision stumps (one-level decision trees) generated with the Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) technique. DeforestVis helps users to explore the complexity versus fidelity trade-off by incrementally generating more stumps, creating attribute-based explanations with weighted stumps to justify decision making, and analysing the impact of rule overriding on training instance allocation between one or more stumps. An independent test set allows users to monitor the effectiveness of manual rule changes and form hypotheses based on case-by-case analyses. We show the applicability and usefulness of DeforestVis with two use cases and expert interviews with data analysts and model developers.</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning Objectives for Sequential Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Attention-based sequential recommendation methods have shown promise in accurately capturing users' evolving interests from their past interactions. Recent research has also explored the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) into these models, in addition to generating superior user representations. By framing sequential recommendation as an RL problem with reward signals, we can develop recommender systems that incorporate direct user feedback in the form of rewards, enhancing personalization for users. Nonetheless, employing RL algorithms presents challenges, including off-policy training, expansive combinatorial action spaces, and the scarcity of datasets with sufficient reward signals. Contemporary approaches have attempted to combine RL and sequential modeling, incorporating contrastive-based objectives and negative sampling strategies for training the RL component. In this work, we further emphasize the efficacy of contrastive-based objectives paired with augmentation to address datasets with extended horizons. Additionally, we recognize the potential instability issues that may arise during the application of negative sampling. These challenges primarily stem from the data imbalance prevalent in real-world datasets, which is a common issue in offline RL contexts. Furthermore, we introduce an enhanced methodology aimed at providing a more effective solution to these challenges. Experimental results across several real datasets show our method with increased robustness and state-of-the-art performance.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by classical work on the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations we present a ResNet-styled neural network architecture that encodes non-expansive (1-Lipschitz) operators, as long as the spectral norms of the weights are appropriately constrained. This is to be contrasted with the ordinary ResNet architecture which, even if the spectral norms of the weights are constrained, has a Lipschitz constant that, in the worst case, grows exponentially with the depth of the network. Further analysis of the proposed architecture shows that the spectral norms of the weights can be further constrained to ensure that the network is an averaged operator, making it a natural candidate for a learned denoiser in Plug-and-Play algorithms. Using a novel adaptive way of enforcing the spectral norm constraints, we show that, even with these constraints, it is possible to train performant networks. The proposed architecture is applied to the problem of adversarially robust image classification, to image denoising, and finally to the inverse problem of deblurring.</description>

      <title>Label Inference Attacks against Node-level Vertical Federated GNNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models by keeping the raw data of the involved workers private. Three of its main objectives are to improve the models' privacy, security, and scalability. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) offers an efficient cross-silo setting where a few parties collaboratively train a model without sharing the same features. In such a scenario, classification labels are commonly considered sensitive information held exclusively by one (active) party, while other (passive) parties use only their local information. Recent works have uncovered important flaws of VFL, leading to possible label inference attacks under the assumption that the attacker has some, even limited, background knowledge on the relation between labels and data. In this work, we are the first (to the best of our knowledge) to investigate label inference attacks on VFL using a zero-background knowledge strategy. To formulate our proposal, we focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a target model for the underlying VFL. In particular, we refer to node classification tasks, which are widely studied, and GNNs have shown promising results. Our proposed attack, BlindSage, provides impressive results in the experiments, achieving nearly 100% accuracy in most cases. Even when the attacker has no information about the used architecture or the number of classes, the accuracy remains above 90% in most instances. Finally, we observe that well-known defenses cannot mitigate our attack without affecting the model's performance on the main classification task.</description>

      <title>Enhanced LFTSformer: A Novel Long-Term Financial Time Series Prediction Model Using Advanced Feature Engineering and the DS Encoder Informer Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a groundbreaking model for forecasting long-term financial time series, termed the Enhanced LFTSformer. The model distinguishes itself through several significant innovations:
  (1) VMD-MIC+FE Feature Engineering: The incorporation of sophisticated feature engineering techniques, specifically through the integration of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), and feature engineering (FE) methods, enables comprehensive perception and extraction of deep-level features from complex and variable financial datasets. (2) DS Encoder Informer: The architecture of the original Informer has been modified by adopting a Stacked Informer structure in the encoder, and an innovative introduction of a multi-head decentralized sparse attention mechanism, referred to as the Distributed Informer. This modification has led to a reduction in the number of attention blocks, thereby enhancing both the training accuracy and speed. (3) GC Enhanced Adam \&amp; Dynamic Loss Function: The deployment of a Gradient Clipping-enhanced Adam optimization algorithm and a dynamic loss function represents a pioneering approach within the domain of financial time series prediction. This novel methodology optimizes model performance and adapts more dynamically to evolving data patterns.
  Systematic experimentation on a range of benchmark stock market datasets demonstrates that the Enhanced LFTSformer outperforms traditional machine learning models and other Informer-based architectures in terms of prediction accuracy, adaptability, and generality. Furthermore, the paper identifies potential avenues for future enhancements, with a particular focus on the identification and quantification of pivotal impacting events and news. This is aimed at further refining the predictive efficacy of the model.</description>

      <title>Streaming Anchor Loss: Augmenting Supervision with Temporal Significance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Streaming neural network models for fast frame-wise responses to various speech and sensory signals are widely adopted on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, increasing the learning capacity of such streaming models (i.e., by adding more parameters) to improve the predictive power may not be viable for real-world tasks. In this work, we propose a new loss, Streaming Anchor Loss (SAL), to better utilize the given learning capacity by encouraging the model to learn more from essential frames. More specifically, our SAL and its focal variations dynamically modulate the frame-wise cross entropy loss based on the importance of the corresponding frames so that a higher loss penalty is assigned for frames within the temporal proximity of semantically critical events. Therefore, our loss ensures that the model training focuses on predicting the relatively rare but task-relevant frames. Experimental results with standard lightweight convolutional and recurrent streaming networks on three different speech based detection tasks demonstrate that SAL enables the model to learn the overall task more effectively with improved accuracy and latency, without any additional data, model parameters, or architectural changes.</description>

      <title>High-probability Convergence Bounds for Nonlinear Stochastic Gradient Descent Under Heavy-tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study high-probability convergence guarantees of learning on streaming data in the presence of heavy-tailed noise. In the proposed scenario, the model is updated in an online fashion, as new information is observed, without storing any additional data. To combat the heavy-tailed noise, we consider a general framework of nonlinear stochastic gradient descent (SGD), providing several strong results. First, for non-convex costs and component-wise nonlinearities, we establish a convergence rate arbitrarily close to $\mathcal{O}\left(t^{-\frac{1}{4}}\right)$, whose exponent is independent of noise and problem parameters. Second, for strongly convex costs and a broader class of nonlinearities, we establish convergence of the last iterate to the optimum, with a rate $\mathcal{O}\left(t^{-\zeta} \right)$, where $\zeta \in (0,1)$ depends on problem parameters, noise and nonlinearity. As we show analytically and numerically, $\zeta$ can be used to inform the preferred choice of nonlinearity for given problem settings. Compared to state-of-the-art, who only consider clipping, require bounded noise moments of order $\eta \in (1,2]$, and establish convergence rates whose exponents go to zero as $\eta \rightarrow 1$, we provide high-probability guarantees for a much broader class of nonlinearities and symmetric density noise, with convergence rates whose exponents are bounded away from zero, even when the noise has finite first moment only. Moreover, in the case of strongly convex functions, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that clipping is not always the optimal nonlinearity, further underlining the value of our general framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-learning enables rapid generalization to new tasks by learning knowledge from various tasks. It is intuitively assumed that as the training progresses, a model will acquire richer knowledge, leading to better generalization performance. However, our experiments reveal an unexpected result: there is negative knowledge transfer between tasks, affecting generalization performance. To explain this phenomenon, we conduct Structural Causal Models (SCMs) for causal analysis. Our investigation uncovers the presence of spurious correlations between task-specific causal factors and labels in meta-learning. Furthermore, the confounding factors differ across different batches. We refer to these confounding factors as "Task Confounders". Based on these findings, we propose a plug-and-play Meta-learning Causal Representation Learner (MetaCRL) to eliminate task confounders. It encodes decoupled generating factors from multiple tasks and utilizes an invariant-based bi-level optimization mechanism to ensure their causality for meta-learning. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our work achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</description>

      <title>Beyond Human Data: Scaling Self-Training for Problem-Solving with Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning language models~(LMs) on human-generated data remains a prevalent practice. However, the performance of such models is often limited by the quantity and diversity of high-quality human data. In this paper, we explore whether we can go beyond human data on tasks where we have access to scalar feedback, for example, on math problems where one can verify correctness. To do so, we investigate a simple self-training method based on expectation-maximization, which we call ReST$^{EM}$, where we (1) generate samples from the model and filter them using binary feedback, (2) fine-tune the model on these samples, and (3) repeat this process a few times. Testing on advanced MATH reasoning and APPS coding benchmarks using PaLM-2 models, we find that ReST$^{EM}$ scales favorably with model size and significantly surpasses fine-tuning only on human data. Overall, our findings suggest self-training with feedback can substantially reduce dependence on human-generated data.</description>

      <title>Read Between the Layers: Leveraging Intra-Layer Representations for Rehearsal-Free Continual Learning with Pre-Trained Models</title>

Abstract: We address the Continual Learning (CL) problem, wherein a model must learn a sequence of tasks from non-stationary distributions while preserving prior knowledge upon encountering new experiences. With the advancement of foundation models, CL research has pivoted from the initial learning-from-scratch paradigm towards utilizing generic features from large-scale pre-training. However, existing approaches to CL with pre-trained models primarily focus on separating class-specific features from the final representation layer and neglect the potential of intermediate representations to capture low- and mid-level features, which are more invariant to domain shifts. In this work, we propose LayUP, a new prototype-based approach to continual learning that leverages second-order feature statistics from multiple intermediate layers of a pre-trained network. Our method is conceptually simple, does not require access to prior data, and works out of the box with any foundation model. LayUP surpasses the state of the art in four of the seven class-incremental learning benchmarks, all three domain-incremental learning benchmarks and in six of the seven online continual learning benchmarks, while significantly reducing memory and computational requirements compared to existing baselines. Our results demonstrate that fully exhausting the representational capacities of pre-trained models in CL goes well beyond their final embeddings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The selection of the assumed effect size (AES) critically determines the duration of an experiment, and hence its accuracy and efficiency. Traditionally, experimenters determine AES based on domain knowledge. However, this method becomes impractical for online experimentation services managing numerous experiments, and a more automated approach is hence of great demand. We initiate the study of data-driven AES selection in for online experimentation services by introducing two solutions. The first employs a three-layer Gaussian Mixture Model considering the heteroskedasticity across experiments, and it seeks to estimate the true expected effect size among positive experiments. The second method, grounded in utility theory, aims to determine the optimal effect size by striking a balance between the experiment's cost and the precision of decision-making. Through comparisons with baseline methods using both simulated and real data, we showcase the superior performance of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at AUROC and AUPRC under Class Imbalance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In machine learning (ML), a widespread adage is that the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is a superior metric for model comparison to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for binary classification tasks with class imbalance. This paper challenges this notion through novel mathematical analysis, illustrating that AUROC and AUPRC can be concisely related in probabilistic terms. We demonstrate that AUPRC, contrary to popular belief, is not superior in cases of class imbalance and might even be a harmful metric, given its inclination to unduly favor model improvements in subpopulations with more frequent positive labels. This bias can inadvertently heighten algorithmic disparities. Prompted by these insights, a thorough review of existing ML literature was conducted, utilizing large language models to analyze over 1.5 million papers from arXiv. Our investigation focused on the prevalence and substantiation of the purported AUPRC superiority. The results expose a significant deficit in empirical backing and a trend of misattributions that have fuelled the widespread acceptance of AUPRC's supposed advantages. Our findings represent a dual contribution: a significant technical advancement in understanding metric behaviors and a stark warning about unchecked assumptions in the ML community.

      <description>arXiv:2401.11609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactuals have been established as a popular explainability technique which leverages a set of minimal edits to alter the prediction of a classifier. When considering conceptual counterfactuals on images, the edits requested should correspond to salient concepts present in the input data. At the same time, conceptual distances are defined by knowledge graphs, ensuring the optimality of conceptual edits. In this work, we extend previous endeavors on graph edits as counterfactual explanations by conducting a comparative study which encompasses both supervised and unsupervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches. To this end, we pose the following significant research question: should we represent input data as graphs, which is the optimal GNN approach in terms of performance and time efficiency to generate minimal and meaningful counterfactual explanations for black-box image classifiers?</description>

Abstract: Learning interpretable representations of data generative latent factors is an important topic for the development of artificial intelligence. With the rise of the large multimodal model, it can align images with text to generate answers. In this work, we propose a framework to comprehensively explain each latent variable in the generative models using a large multimodal model. We further measure the uncertainty of our generated explanations, quantitatively evaluate the performance of explanation generation among multiple large multimodal models, and qualitatively visualize the variations of each latent variable to learn the disentanglement effects of different generative models on explanations. Finally, we discuss the explanatory capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art large multimodal models.</description>

      <title>Optimal Parallelization Strategies for Active Flow Control in Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for handling highly dynamic and nonlinear Active Flow Control (AFC) problems. However, the computational cost associated with training DRL models presents a significant performance bottleneck. To address this challenge and enable efficient scaling on high-performance computing architectures, this study focuses on optimizing DRL-based algorithms in parallel settings. We validate an existing state-of-the-art DRL framework used for AFC problems and discuss its efficiency bottlenecks. Subsequently, by deconstructing the overall framework and conducting extensive scalability benchmarks for individual components, we investigate various hybrid parallelization configurations and propose efficient parallelization strategies. Moreover, we refine input/output (I/O) operations in multi-environment DRL training to tackle critical overhead associated with data movement. Finally, we demonstrate the optimized framework for a typical AFC problem where near-linear scaling can be obtained for the overall framework. We achieve a significant boost in parallel efficiency from around 49% to approximately 78%, and the training process is accelerated by approximately 47 times using 60 CPU cores. These findings are expected to provide valuable insights for further advancements in DRL-based AFC studies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spatio-Temporal Representations: Evolving Fourier Transform for Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Evolving Graph Fourier Transform (EFT), the first invertible spectral transform that captures evolving representations on temporal graphs. We motivate our work by the inadequacy of existing methods for capturing the evolving graph spectra, which are also computationally expensive due to the temporal aspect along with the graph vertex domain. We view the problem as an optimization over the Laplacian of the continuous time dynamic graph. Additionally, we propose pseudo-spectrum relaxations that decompose the transformation process, making it highly computationally efficient. The EFT method adeptly captures the evolving graph's structural and positional properties, making it effective for downstream tasks on evolving graphs. Hence, as a reference implementation, we develop a simple neural model induced with EFT for capturing evolving graph spectra. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of large-scale and standard temporal graph benchmarks and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Actions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems are characterized by their reliance on high cardinality, heterogeneous features and the need to handle tens of billions of user actions on a daily basis. Despite being trained on huge volume of data with thousands of features, most Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) in industry fail to scale with compute.
  Inspired by success achieved by Transformers in language and vision domains, we revisit fundamental design choices in recommendation systems. We reformulate recommendation problems as sequential transduction tasks within a generative modeling framework (``Generative Recommenders''), and propose a new architecture, HSTU, designed for high cardinality, non-stationary streaming recommendation data.
  HSTU outperforms baselines over synthetic and public datasets by up to 65.8\% in NDCG, and is 5.3x to 15.2x faster than FlashAttention2-based Transformers on 8192 length sequences. HSTU-based Generative Recommenders, with 1.5 trillion parameters, improve metrics in online A/B tests by 12.4\% and have been deployed on multiple surfaces of a large internet platform with billions of users. More importantly, the model quality of Generative Recommenders empirically scales as a power-law of training compute across three orders of magnitude, up to GPT-3/LLaMa-2 scale, which reduces carbon footprint needed for future model developments, and further paves the way for the first foundational models in recommendations.</description>

      <title>Control-based Graph Embeddings with Data Augmentation for Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised graph representation learning by harnessing the control properties of dynamical networks defined on graphs. Our approach introduces a novel framework for contrastive learning, a widely prevalent technique for unsupervised representation learning. A crucial step in contrastive learning is the creation of 'augmented' graphs from the input graphs. Though different from the original graphs, these augmented graphs retain the original graph's structural characteristics. Here, we propose a unique method for generating these augmented graphs by leveraging the control properties of networks. The core concept revolves around perturbing the original graph to create a new one while preserving the controllability properties specific to networks and graphs. Compared to the existing methods, we demonstrate that this innovative approach enhances the effectiveness of contrastive learning frameworks, leading to superior results regarding the accuracy of the classification tasks. The key innovation lies in our ability to decode the network structure using these control properties, opening new avenues for unsupervised graph representation learning.</description>

      <title>A Clustering Method with Graph Maximum Decoding Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The clustering method based on graph models has garnered increased attention for its widespread applicability across various knowledge domains. Its adaptability to integrate seamlessly with other relevant applications endows the graph model-based clustering analysis with the ability to robustly extract "natural associations" or "graph structures" within datasets, facilitating the modelling of relationships between data points. Despite its efficacy, the current clustering method utilizing the graph-based model overlooks the uncertainty associated with random walk access between nodes and the embedded structural information in the data. To address this gap, we present a novel Clustering method for Maximizing Decoding Information within graph-based models, named CMDI. CMDI innovatively incorporates two-dimensional structural information theory into the clustering process, consisting of two phases: graph structure extraction and graph vertex partitioning. Within CMDI, graph partitioning is reformulated as an abstract clustering problem, leveraging maximum decoding information to minimize uncertainty associated with random visits to vertices. Empirical evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CMDI outperforms classical baseline methods, exhibiting a superior decoding information ratio (DI-R). Furthermore, CMDI showcases heightened efficiency, particularly when considering prior knowledge (PK). These findings underscore the effectiveness of CMDI in enhancing decoding information quality and computational efficiency, positioning it as a valuable tool in graph-based clustering analyses.</description>

      <title>PDE-CNNs: Axiomatic Derivations and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PDE-based Group Convolutional Neural Networks (PDE-G-CNNs) utilize solvers of geometrically meaningful evolution PDEs as substitutes for the conventional components in G-CNNs. PDE-G-CNNs offer several key benefits all at once: fewer parameters, inherent equivariance, better performance, data efficiency, and geometric interpretability.
  In this article we focus on Euclidean equivariant PDE-G-CNNs where the feature maps are two dimensional throughout. We call this variant of the framework a PDE-CNN.
  From a machine learning perspective, we list several practically desirable axioms and derive from these which PDEs should be used in a PDE-CNN. Here our approach to geometric learning via PDEs is inspired by the axioms of classical linear and morphological scale-space theory, which we generalize by introducing semifield-valued signals.
  Furthermore, we experimentally confirm for small networks that PDE-CNNs offer fewer parameters, increased performance, and better data efficiency when compared to CNNs. We also investigate what effect the use of different semifields has on the performance of the models.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Exploration of $\mu$-Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large neural network models have become a mainstay of natural language processing and computer vision, yet their initialization and learning rates are set in a largely heuristic fashion, potentially varying from paper to paper and one model size to the next. The $\mu$-Parameterization ($\mu$P) offers a potential solution to these challenges, yielding scaling rules for model initialization and learning rates, and reportedly enabling zero-shot hyperparameter transfer from small to large models in a variety of cases.
  Despite the evident promise, the $\mu$P scaling rules are not yet widely adopted, perhaps due to higher implementation complexity, many variations, or complex theoretical background. This work investigates $\mu$P empirically, focusing on the ubiquitous transformer architecture, and aims to answer a simple question: does $\mu$-Transfer yield optimal learning rates in practice? Studying models with up to 10B parameters and training budgets of up to 190B tokens, we find $\mu$-Transfer works as intended for the majority of important cases, yet also identify a few cases where it may not.

      <title>HCL-MTSAD: Hierarchical Contrastive Consistency Learning for Accurate Detection of Industrial Multivariate Time Series Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) anomaly detection focuses on pinpointing samples that diverge from standard operational patterns, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of industrial applications. The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\% in terms of F1 score.</description>

      <title>Predicting Traffic Congestion at Urban Intersections Using Data-Driven Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08838v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic congestion at intersections is a significant issue in urban areas, leading to increased commute times, safety hazards, and operational inefficiencies. This study aims to develop a predictive model for congestion at intersections in major U.S. cities, utilizing a dataset of trip-logging metrics from commercial vehicles across 4,800 intersections. The dataset encompasses 27 features, including intersection coordinates, street names, time of day, and traffic metrics (Kashyap et al., 2019). Additional features, such as rainfall/snowfall percentage, distance from downtown and outskirts, and road types, were incorporated to enhance the model's predictive power. The methodology involves data exploration, feature transformation, and handling missing values through low-rank models and label encoding. The proposed model has the potential to assist city planners and governments in anticipating traffic hot spots, optimizing operations, and identifying infrastructure challenges.</description>

      <title>Beyond Known Clusters: Probe New Prototypes for Efficient Generalized Class Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized Class Discovery (GCD) aims to dynamically assign labels to unlabelled data partially based on knowledge learned from labelled data, where the unlabelled data may come from known or novel classes. The prevailing approach generally involves clustering across all data and learning conceptions by prototypical contrastive learning. However, existing methods largely hinge on the performance of clustering algorithms and are thus subject to their inherent limitations. Firstly, the estimated cluster number is often smaller than the ground truth, making the existing methods suffer from the lack of prototypes for comprehensive conception learning. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive probing mechanism that introduces learnable potential prototypes to expand cluster prototypes (centers). As there is no ground truth for the potential prototype, we develop a self-supervised prototype learning framework to optimize the potential prototype in an end-to-end fashion. Secondly, clustering is computationally intensive, and the conventional strategy of clustering both labelled and unlabelled instances exacerbates this issue. To counteract this inefficiency, we opt to cluster only the unlabelled instances and subsequently expand the cluster prototypes with our introduced potential prototypes to fast explore novel classes. Despite the simplicity of our proposed method, extensive empirical analysis on a wide range of datasets confirms that our method consistently delivers state-of-the-art results. Specifically, our method surpasses the nearest competitor by a significant margin of \textbf{9.7}$\%$ within the Stanford Cars dataset and \textbf{12$\times$} clustering efficiency within the Herbarium 19 dataset. We will make the code and checkpoints publicly available at \url{https://github.com/xjtuYW/PNP.git}.</description>

      <title>CARE to Compare: A real-world dataset for anomaly detection in wind turbine data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in the field of predictive maintenance for wind turbines, yet the comparison of different algorithms poses a difficult task because domain specific public datasets are scarce. Many comparisons of different approaches either use benchmarks composed of data from many different domains, inaccessible data or one of the few publicly available datasets which lack detailed information about the faults. Moreover, many publications highlight a couple of case studies where fault detection was successful. With this paper we publish a high quality dataset that contains data from 36 wind turbines across 3 different wind farms as well as the most detailed fault information of any public wind turbine dataset as far as we know. The new dataset contains 89 years worth of real-world operating data of wind turbines, distributed across 44 labeled time frames for anomalies that led up to faults, as well as 51 time series representing normal behavior. Additionally, the quality of training data is ensured by turbine-status-based labels for each data point. Furthermore, we propose a new scoring method, called CARE (Coverage, Accuracy, Reliability and Earliness), which takes advantage of the information depth that is present in the dataset to identify a good all-around anomaly detection model. This score considers the anomaly detection performance, the ability to recognize normal behavior properly and the capability to raise as few false alarms as possible while simultaneously detecting anomalies early.</description>

      <title>Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning via Diffusion-based Dual Generative Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study continual offline reinforcement learning, a practical paradigm that facilitates forward transfer and mitigates catastrophic forgetting to tackle sequential offline tasks. We propose a dual generative replay framework that retains previous knowledge by concurrent replay of generated pseudo-data. First, we decouple the continual learning policy into a diffusion-based generative behavior model and a multi-head action evaluation model, allowing the policy to inherit distributional expressivity for encompassing a progressive range of diverse behaviors. Second, we train a task-conditioned diffusion model to mimic state distributions of past tasks. Generated states are paired with corresponding responses from the behavior generator to represent old tasks with high-fidelity replayed samples. Finally, by interleaving pseudo samples with real ones of the new task, we continually update the state and behavior generators to model progressively diverse behaviors, and regularize the multi-head critic via behavior cloning to mitigate forgetting. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better forward transfer with less forgetting, and closely approximates the results of using previous ground-truth data due to its high-fidelity replay of the sample space. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/NJU-RL/CuGRO}{https://github.com/NJU-RL/CuGRO}.</description>

      <title>LongVQ: Long Sequence Modeling with Vector Quantization on Structured Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer models have been successful in various sequence processing tasks, but the self-attention mechanism's computational cost limits its practicality for long sequences. Although there are existing attention variants that improve computational efficiency, they have a limited ability to abstract global information effectively based on their hand-crafted mixing strategies. On the other hand, state-space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences but cannot capture complicated local information. Therefore, the combination of them as a unified token mixer is a trend in recent long-sequence models. However, the linearized attention degrades performance significantly even when equipped with SSMs. To address the issue, we propose a new method called LongVQ. LongVQ uses the vector quantization (VQ) technique to compress the global abstraction as a length-fixed codebook, enabling the linear-time computation of the attention matrix. This technique effectively maintains dynamic global and local patterns, which helps to complement the lack of long-range dependency issues. Our experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and image and speech classification demonstrate the effectiveness of LongVQ. Our model achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers, Convolutions, and recent State Space Models.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks via Complex Network Theory: a Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be represented as graphs whose links and vertices iteratively process data and solve tasks sub-optimally. Complex Network Theory (CNT), merging statistical physics with graph theory, provides a method for interpreting neural networks by analysing their weights and neuron structures. However, classic works adapt CNT metrics that only permit a topological analysis as they do not account for the effect of the input data. In addition, CNT metrics have been applied to a limited range of architectures, mainly including Fully Connected neural networks. In this work, we extend the existing CNT metrics with measures that sample from the DNNs' training distribution, shifting from a purely topological analysis to one that connects with the interpretability of deep learning. For the novel metrics, in addition to the existing ones, we provide a mathematical formalisation for Fully Connected, AutoEncoder, Convolutional and Recurrent neural networks, of which we vary the activation functions and the number of hidden layers. We show that these metrics differentiate DNNs based on the architecture, the number of hidden layers, and the activation function. Our contribution provides a method rooted in physics for interpreting DNNs that offers insights beyond the traditional input-output relationship and the CNT topological analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1904.06866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting human decision-making under risk and uncertainty represents a quintessential challenge that spans economics, psychology, and related disciplines. Despite decades of research effort, no model can be said to accurately describe and predict human choice even for the most stylized tasks like choice between lotteries. Here, we introduce BEAST Gradient Boosting (BEAST-GB), a novel hybrid model that synergizes behavioral theories, specifically the model BEAST, with machine learning techniques. First, we show the effectiveness of BEAST-GB by describing CPC18, an open competition for prediction of human decision making under risk and uncertainty, in which BEAST-GB won. Second, we show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the largest publicly available dataset of human risky choice, outperforming purely data-driven neural networks, indicating the continued relevance of BEAST theoretical insights in the presence of large data. Third, we demonstrate BEAST-GB's superior predictive power in an ensemble of choice experiments in which the BEAST model alone falters, underscoring the indispensable role of machine learning in interpreting complex idiosyncratic behavioral data. Finally, we show BEAST-GB also displays robust domain generalization capabilities as it effectively predicts choice behavior in new experimental contexts that it was not trained on. These results confirm the potency of combining domain-specific theoretical frameworks with machine learning, underscoring a methodological advance with broad implications for modeling decisions in diverse environments.</description>

Abstract: Two-player, constant-sum games are well studied in the literature, but there has been limited progress outside of this setting. We propose Joint Policy-Space Response Oracles (JPSRO), an algorithm for training agents in n-player, general-sum extensive form games, which provably converges to an equilibrium. We further suggest correlated equilibria (CE) as promising meta-solvers, and propose a novel solution concept Maximum Gini Correlated Equilibrium (MGCE), a principled and computationally efficient family of solutions for solving the correlated equilibrium selection problem. We conduct several experiments using CE meta-solvers for JPSRO and demonstrate convergence on n-player, general-sum games.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inference stage of diffusion models can be seen as running a reverse-time diffusion stochastic differential equation, where samples from a Gaussian latent distribution are transformed into samples from a target distribution that usually reside on a low-dimensional manifold, e.g., an image manifold. The intermediate values between the initial latent space and the image manifold can be interpreted as noisy images, with the amount of noise determined by the forward diffusion process noise schedule. We utilize this interpretation to present Boomerang, an approach for local sampling of image manifolds. As implied by its name, Boomerang local sampling involves adding noise to an input image, moving it closer to the latent space, and then mapping it back to the image manifold through a partial reverse diffusion process. Thus, Boomerang generates images on the manifold that are ``similar,'' but nonidentical, to the original input image. We can control the proximity of the generated images to the original by adjusting the amount of noise added. Furthermore, due to the stochastic nature of the reverse diffusion process in Boomerang, the generated images display a certain degree of stochasticity, allowing us to obtain local samples from the manifold without encountering any duplicates. Boomerang offers the flexibility to work seamlessly with any pretrained diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion, without necessitating any adjustments to the reverse diffusion process. We present three applications for Boomerang. First, we provide a framework for constructing privacy-preserving datasets having controllable degrees of anonymity. Second, we show that using Boomerang for data augmentation increases generalization performance and outperforms state-of-the-art synthetic data augmentation. Lastly, we introduce a perceptual image enhancement framework, which enables resolution enhancement.</description>

      <title>Precise Asymptotics for Spectral Methods in Mixed Generalized Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a mixed generalized linear model, the objective is to learn multiple signals from unlabeled observations: each sample comes from exactly one signal, but it is not known which one. We consider the prototypical problem of estimating two statistically independent signals in a mixed generalized linear model with Gaussian covariates. Spectral methods are a popular class of estimators which output the top two eigenvectors of a suitable data-dependent matrix. However, despite the wide applicability, their design is still obtained via heuristic considerations, and the number of samples $n$ needed to guarantee recovery is super-linear in the signal dimension $d$. In this paper, we develop exact asymptotics on spectral methods in the challenging proportional regime in which $n, d$ grow large and their ratio converges to a finite constant. By doing so, we are able to optimize the design of the spectral method, and combine it with a simple linear estimator, in order to minimize the estimation error. Our characterization exploits a mix of tools from random matrices, free probability and the theory of approximate message passing algorithms. Numerical simulations for mixed linear regression and phase retrieval demonstrate the advantage enabled by our analysis over existing designs of spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Framework-agnostic Semantically-aware Global Reasoning for Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in pixel-level tasks (e.g. segmentation) illustrate the benefit of of long-range interactions between aggregated region-based representations that can enhance local features. However, such aggregated representations, often in the form of attention, fail to model the underlying semantics of the scene (e.g. individual objects and, by extension, their interactions). In this work, we address the issue by proposing a component that learns to project image features into latent representations and reason between them using a transformer encoder to generate contextualized and scene-consistent representations which are fused with original image features. Our design encourages the latent regions to represent semantic concepts by ensuring that the activated regions are spatially disjoint and the union of such regions corresponds to a connected object segment. The proposed semantic global reasoning (SGR) component is end-to-end trainable and can be easily added to a wide variety of backbones (CNN or transformer-based) and segmentation heads (per-pixel or mask classification) to consistently improve the segmentation results on different datasets. In addition, our latent tokens are semantically interpretable and diverse and provide a rich set of features that can be transferred to downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, with improved performance. Furthermore, we also proposed metrics to quantify the semantics of latent tokens at both class \&amp; instance level.</description>

Abstract: Blockchain technology has been successfully exploited for deploying new economic applications. However, it has started arousing the interest of malicious actors who deliver scams to deceive honest users and to gain economic advantages. Ponzi schemes are one of the most common scams. Here, we present a classifier for detecting smart Ponzi contracts on Ethereum, which can be used as the backbone for developing detection tools. First, we release a labelled data set with 4422 unique real-world smart contracts to address the problem of the unavailability of labelled data. Then, we show that our classifier outperforms the ones proposed in the literature when considering the AUC as a metric. Finally, we identify a small and effective set of features that ensures a good classification quality and investigate their impacts on the classification using eXplainable AI techniques.</description>

      <title>Wav2code: Restore Clean Speech Representations via Codebook Lookup for Noise-Robust ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has gained remarkable successes thanks to recent advances of deep learning, but it usually degrades significantly under real-world noisy conditions. Recent works introduce speech enhancement (SE) as front-end to improve speech quality, which is proved effective but may not be optimal for downstream ASR due to speech distortion problem. Based on that, latest works combine SE and currently popular self-supervised learning (SSL) to alleviate distortion and improve noise robustness. Despite the effectiveness, the speech distortion caused by conventional SE still cannot be cleared out. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework named Wav2code to implement a feature-level SE with reduced distortions for noise-robust ASR. First, in pre-training stage the clean speech representations from SSL model are sent to lookup a discrete codebook via nearest-neighbor feature matching, the resulted code sequence are then exploited to reconstruct the original clean representations, in order to store them in codebook as prior. Second, during finetuning we propose a Transformer-based code predictor to accurately predict clean codes by modeling the global dependency of input noisy representations, which enables discovery and restoration of high-quality clean representations with reduced distortions. Furthermore, we propose an interactive feature fusion network to combine original noisy and the restored clean representations to consider both fidelity and quality, resulting in more informative features for downstream ASR. Finally, experiments on both synthetic and real noisy datasets demonstrate that Wav2code can solve the speech distortion and improve ASR performance under various noisy conditions, resulting in stronger robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models can perform well on general natural language tasks, but their effectiveness is still not optimal for information extraction. Recent works indicate that the main reason lies in the lack of extensive data on information extraction instructions. Note that the existing datasets on information extraction instructions not only have limited coverage but also involve high construction costs. To address this issue, we introduce InstructIE, a bilingual instruction-based information extraction dataset, which covers 12 diverse domains. Specifically, we propose KG2Instruction, a framework specifically for the automatic generation of such datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that large language models trained with InstructIE can not only obtain better information extraction capabilities but also enhance zero-shot performance compared with baselines.</description>

Abstract: Edge artificial intelligence (AI) has been a promising solution towards 6G to empower a series of advanced techniques such as digital twins, holographic projection, semantic communications, and auto-driving, for achieving intelligence of everything. The performance of edge AI tasks, including edge learning and edge AI inference, depends on the quality of three highly coupled processes, i.e., sensing for data acquisition, computation for information extraction, and communication for information transmission. However, these three modules need to compete for network resources for enhancing their own quality-of-services. To this end, integrated sensing-communication-computation (ISCC) is of paramount significance for improving resource utilization as well as achieving the customized goals of edge AI tasks. By investigating the interplay among the three modules, this article presents various kinds of ISCC schemes for federated edge learning tasks and edge AI inference tasks in both application and physical layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are widely applied in various fields. Stakeholders often use post-hoc feature importance methods to better understand the input features' contribution to the models' predictions. The interpretation of the importance values provided by these methods is frequently based on the relative order of the features (their ranking) rather than the importance values themselves. Since the order may be unstable, we present a framework for quantifying the uncertainty in global importance values. We propose a novel method for the post-hoc interpretation of feature importance values that is based on the framework and pairwise comparisons of the feature importance values. This method produces simultaneous confidence intervals for the features' ranks, which include the ``true'' (infinite sample) ranks with high probability, and enables the selection of the set of the top-k important features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans construct internal cognitive maps of their environment directly from sensory inputs without access to a system of explicit coordinates or distance measurements. While machine learning algorithms like SLAM utilize specialized visual inference procedures to identify visual features and construct spatial maps from visual and odometry data, the general nature of cognitive maps in the brain suggests a unified mapping algorithmic strategy that can generalize to auditory, tactile, and linguistic inputs. Here, we demonstrate that predictive coding provides a natural and versatile neural network algorithm for constructing spatial maps using sensory data. We introduce a framework in which an agent navigates a virtual environment while engaging in visual predictive coding using a self-attention-equipped convolutional neural network. While learning a next image prediction task, the agent automatically constructs an internal representation of the environment that quantitatively reflects distances. The internal map enables the agent to pinpoint its location relative to landmarks using only visual information.The predictive coding network generates a vectorized encoding of the environment that supports vector navigation where individual latent space units delineate localized, overlapping neighborhoods in the environment. Broadly, our work introduces predictive coding as a unified algorithmic framework for constructing cognitive maps that can naturally extend to the mapping of auditory, sensorimotor, and linguistic inputs.</description>

      <title>Learning Energy-Based Models by Cooperative Diffusion Recovery Likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05153v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training energy-based models (EBMs) on high-dimensional data can be both challenging and time-consuming, and there exists a noticeable gap in sample quality between EBMs and other generative frameworks like GANs and diffusion models. To close this gap, inspired by the recent efforts of learning EBMs by maximizing diffusion recovery likelihood (DRL), we propose cooperative diffusion recovery likelihood (CDRL), an effective approach to tractably learn and sample from a series of EBMs defined on increasingly noisy versions of a dataset, paired with an initializer model for each EBM. At each noise level, the two models are jointly estimated within a cooperative training framework: samples from the initializer serve as starting points that are refined by a few MCMC sampling steps from the EBM. The EBM is then optimized by maximizing recovery likelihood, while the initializer model is optimized by learning from the difference between the refined samples and the initial samples. In addition, we made several practical designs for EBM training to further improve the sample quality. Combining these advances, our approach significantly boost the generation performance compared to existing EBM methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our models for several downstream tasks, including classifier-free guided generation, compositional generation, image inpainting and out-of-distribution detection.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds on Pauli channel learning without entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource for learning properties from nature, but a precise characterization of its advantage can be challenging. In this work, we consider learning algorithms without entanglement to be those that only utilize states, measurements, and operations that are separable between the main system of interest and an ancillary system. Interestingly, we show that these algorithms are equivalent to those that apply quantum circuits on the main system interleaved with mid-circuit measurements and classical feedforward. Within this setting, we prove a tight lower bound for Pauli channel learning without entanglement that closes the gap between the best-known upper and lower bound. In particular, we show that $\Theta(2^n\varepsilon^{-2})$ rounds of measurements are required to estimate each eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli channel to $\varepsilon$ error with high probability when learning without entanglement. In contrast, a learning algorithm with entanglement only needs $\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$ copies of the Pauli channel. The tight lower bound strengthens the foundation for an experimental demonstration of entanglement-enhanced advantages for Pauli noise characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern distribution matching algorithms for training diffusion or flow models directly prescribe the time evolution of the marginal distributions between two boundary distributions. In this work, we consider a generalized distribution matching setup, where these marginals are only implicitly described as a solution to some task-specific objective function. The problem setup, known as the Generalized Schr\"odinger Bridge (GSB), appears prevalently in many scientific areas both within and without machine learning. We propose Generalized Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (GSBM), a new matching algorithm inspired by recent advances, generalizing them beyond kinetic energy minimization and to account for task-specific state costs. We show that such a generalization can be cast as solving conditional stochastic optimal control, for which efficient variational approximations can be used, and further debiased with the aid of path integral theory. Compared to prior methods for solving GSB problems, our GSBM algorithm better preserves a feasible transport map between the boundary distributions throughout training, thereby enabling stable convergence and significantly improved scalability. We empirically validate our claims on an extensive suite of experimental setups, including crowd navigation, opinion depolarization, LiDAR manifolds, and image domain transfer. Our work brings new algorithmic opportunities for training diffusion models enhanced with task-specific optimality structures.

      <description>arXiv:2310.08182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the promising performance of existing visual models on public benchmarks, the critical assessment of their robustness for real-world applications remains an ongoing challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose an explainable visual dataset, XIMAGENET-12, to evaluate the robustness of visual models. XIMAGENET-12 consists of over 200K images with 15,410 manual semantic annotations. Specifically, we deliberately selected 12 categories from ImageNet, representing objects commonly encountered in practical life. To simulate real-world situations, we incorporated six diverse scenarios, such as overexposure, blurring, and color changes, etc. We further develop a quantitative criterion for robustness assessment, allowing for a nuanced understanding of how visual models perform under varying conditions, notably in relation to the background. We make the XIMAGENET-12 dataset and its corresponding code openly accessible at \url{https://sites.google.com/view/ximagenet-12/home}. We expect the introduction of the XIMAGENET-12 dataset will empower researchers to thoroughly evaluate the robustness of their visual models under challenging conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08475v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on editing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Compared to editing single-modal LLMs, multimodal model editing is more challenging, which demands a higher level of scrutiny and careful consideration in the editing process. To facilitate research in this area, we construct a new benchmark, dubbed MMEdit, for editing multimodal LLMs and establishing a suite of innovative metrics for evaluation. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving various model editing baselines and analyze the impact of editing different components for multimodal LLMs. Empirically, we notice that previous baselines can implement editing multimodal LLMs to some extent, but the effect is still barely satisfactory, indicating the potential difficulty of this task. We hope that our work can provide the NLP community with insights. Code and dataset are available in https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in large language models for Natural Language Processing (NLP), we design a time-series foundation model for forecasting whose out-of-the-box zero-shot performance on a variety of public datasets comes close to the accuracy of state-of-the-art supervised forecasting models for each individual dataset. Our model is based on pretraining a patched-decoder style attention model on a large time-series corpus, and can work well across different forecasting history lengths, prediction lengths and temporal granularities.</description>

Abstract: Solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) PDEs numerically enables equilibrial feedback control in two-player differential games, yet faces the curse of dimensionality (CoD). While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in alleviating CoD in solving PDEs, vanilla PINNs fall short in learning discontinuous solutions due to their sampling nature, leading to poor safety performance of the resulting policies when values are discontinuous due to state or temporal logic constraints. In this study, we explore three potential solutions to this challenge: (1) a hybrid learning method that is guided by both supervisory equilibria and the HJI PDE, (2) a value-hardening method where a sequence of HJIs are solved with increasing Lipschitz constant on the constraint violation penalty, and (3) the epigraphical technique that lifts the value to a higher dimensional state space where it becomes continuous. Evaluations through 5D and 9D vehicle and 13D drone simulations reveal that the hybrid method outperforms others in terms of generalization and safety performance by taking advantage of both the supervisory equilibrium values and costates, and the low cost of PINN loss gradients.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control Matching</title>

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control, which has the goal of driving the behavior of noisy systems, is broadly applicable in science, engineering and artificial intelligence. Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that may be of independent interest. Code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SOC-matching</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Aggregation and Recursive Alignment Architecture for Efficient Parallel Inference Segmentation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time semantic segmentation is a crucial research for real-world applications. However, many methods lay particular emphasis on reducing the computational complexity and model size, while largely sacrificing the accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose a parallel inference network customized for semantic segmentation tasks to achieve a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. We employ a shallow backbone to ensure real-time speed, and propose three core components to compensate for the reduced model capacity to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first design a dual-pyramidal path architecture (Multi-level Feature Aggregation Module, MFAM) to aggregate multi-level features from the encoder to each scale, providing hierarchical clues for subsequent spatial alignment and corresponding in-network inference. Then, we build Recursive Alignment Module (RAM) by combining the flow-based alignment module with recursive upsampling architecture for accurate spatial alignment between multi-scale feature maps with half the computational complexity of the straightforward alignment method. Finally, we perform independent parallel inference on the aligned features to obtain multi-scale scores, and adaptively fuse them through an attention-based Adaptive Scores Fusion Module (ASFM) so that the final prediction can favor objects of multiple scales. Our framework shows a better balance between speed and accuracy than state-of-the-art real-time methods on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets. We also conducted systematic ablation studies to gain insight into our motivation and architectural design. Code is available at: https://github.com/Yanhua-Zhang/MFARANet.</description>

      <title>DimVis: Interpreting Visual Clusters in Dimensionality Reduction With Explainable Boosting Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular for transforming complex datasets into simpler visual representations. However, while effective in uncovering general dataset patterns, these methods may introduce artifacts and suffer from interpretability issues. This paper presents DimVis, a visualization tool that employs supervised Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) models (trained on user-selected data of interest) as an interpretation assistant for DR projections. Our tool facilitates high-dimensional data analysis by providing an interpretation of feature relevance in visual clusters through interactive exploration of UMAP projections. Specifically, DimVis uses a contrastive EBM model that is trained in real time to differentiate between the data inside and outside a cluster of interest. Taking advantage of the inherent explainable nature of the EBM, we then use this model to interpret the cluster itself via single and pairwise feature comparisons in a ranking based on the EBM model's feature importance. The applicability and effectiveness of DimVis are demonstrated via a use case and a usage scenario with real-world data. We also discuss the limitations and potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Domain Knowledge for Efficient Reward Modelling in RLHF: A Case-Study in E-Commerce Opinion Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a dominating strategy in aligning Language Models (LMs) with human values/goals. The key to the strategy is learning a reward model ($\varphi$), which can reflect the latent reward model of humans. While this strategy has proven effective, the training methodology requires a lot of human preference annotation (usually in the order of tens of thousands) to train $\varphi$. Such a large-scale annotation is justifiable when it's a one-time effort, and the reward model is universally applicable. However, human goals are subjective and depend on the task, requiring task-specific preference annotations, which can be impractical to fulfill. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to infuse domain knowledge into $\varphi$, which reduces the amount of preference annotation required ($21\times$), omits Alignment Tax, and provides some interpretability. We validate our approach in E-Commerce Opinion Summarization, with a significant reduction in dataset size (to just $940$ samples) while advancing the SOTA ($\sim4$ point ROUGE-L improvement, $68\%$ of times preferred by humans over SOTA). Our contributions include a novel Reward Modeling technique and two new datasets: PromptOpinSumm (supervised data for Opinion Summarization) and OpinPref (a gold-standard human preference dataset). The proposed methodology opens up avenues for efficient RLHF, making it more adaptable to applications with varying human values. We release the artifacts (Code: github.com/efficient-rlhf. PromptOpinSumm: hf.co/prompt-opin-summ. OpinPref: hf.co/opin-pref) for usage under MIT License.</description>

      <title>State Space Models for Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, state-of-the-art deep neural networks that process event-camera data first convert a temporal window of events into dense, grid-like input representations. As such, they exhibit poor generalizability when deployed at higher inference frequencies (i.e., smaller temporal windows) than the ones they were trained on. We address this challenge by introducing state-space models (SSMs) with learnable timescale parameters to event-based vision. This design adapts to varying frequencies without the need to retrain the network at different frequencies. Additionally, we investigate two strategies to counteract aliasing effects when deploying the model at higher frequencies. We comprehensively evaluate our approach against existing methods based on RNN and Transformer architectures across various benchmarks, including Gen1 and 1 Mpx event camera datasets. Our results demonstrate that SSM-based models train 33% faster and also exhibit minimal performance degradation when tested at higher frequencies than the training input. Traditional RNN and Transformer models exhibit performance drops of more than 20 mAP, with SSMs having a drop of 3.76 mAP, highlighting the effectiveness of SSMs in event-based vision tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sora is a text-to-video generative AI model, released by OpenAI in February 2024. The model is trained to generate videos of realistic or imaginative scenes from text instructions and show potential in simulating the physical world. Based on public technical reports and reverse engineering, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the model's background, related technologies, applications, remaining challenges, and future directions of text-to-video AI models. We first trace Sora's development and investigate the underlying technologies used to build this "world simulator". Then, we describe in detail the applications and potential impact of Sora in multiple industries ranging from film-making and education to marketing. We discuss the main challenges and limitations that need to be addressed to widely deploy Sora, such as ensuring safe and unbiased video generation. Lastly, we discuss the future development of Sora and video generation models in general, and how advancements in the field could enable new ways of human-AI interaction, boosting productivity and creativity of video generation.</description>

      <title>Beacon, a lightweight deep reinforcement learning benchmark library for flow control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the increasing use of deep reinforcement learning for flow control problems has led to a new area of research, focused on the coupling and the adaptation of the existing algorithms to the control of numerical fluid dynamics environments. Although still in its infancy, the field has seen multiple successes in a short time span, and its fast development pace can certainly be partly imparted to the open-source effort that drives the expansion of the community. Yet, this emerging domain still misses a common ground to (i) ensure the reproducibility of the results, and (ii) offer a proper ad-hoc benchmarking basis. To this end, we propose Beacon, an open-source benchmark library composed of seven lightweight 1D and 2D flow control problems with various characteristics, action and observation space characteristics, and CPU requirements. In this contribution, the seven considered problems are described, and reference control solutions are provided. The sources for the following work are available at https://github.com/jviquerat/beacon.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Differential Privacy Under Continual Observation and Online Threshold Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most basic problems for studying the "price of privacy over time" is the so called private counter problem, introduced by Dwork et al. (2010) and Chan et al. (2010). In this problem, we aim to track the number of events that occur over time, while hiding the existence of every single event. More specifically, in every time step $t\in[T]$ we learn (in an online fashion) that $\Delta_t\geq 0$ new events have occurred, and must respond with an estimate $n_t\approx\sum_{j=1}^t \Delta_j$. The privacy requirement is that all of the outputs together, across all time steps, satisfy event level differential privacy. The main question here is how our error needs to depend on the total number of time steps $T$ and the total number of events $n$. Dwork et al. (2015) showed an upper bound of $O\left(\log(T)+\log^2(n)\right)$, and Henzinger et al. (2023) showed a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\min\{\log n, \log T\}\right)$. We show a new lower bound of $\Omega\left(\min\{n,\log T\}\right)$, which is tight w.r.t. the dependence on $T$, and is tight in the sparse case where $\log^2 n=O(\log T)$. Our lower bound has the following implications:
  $\bullet$ We show that our lower bound extends to the "online thresholds problem", where the goal is to privately answer many "quantile queries" when these queries are presented one-by-one. This resolves an open question of Bun et al. (2017).
  $\bullet$ Our lower bound implies, for the first time, a separation between the number of mistakes obtainable by a private online learner and a non-private online learner. This partially resolves a COLT'22 open question published by Sanyal and Ramponi.
  $\bullet$ Our lower bound also yields the first separation between the standard model of private online learning and a recently proposed relaxed variant of it, called private online prediction.</description>

      <title>Improving Socratic Question Generation using Data Augmentation and Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Socratic method is a way of guiding students toward solving a problem independently without directly revealing the solution to the problem. Although this method has been shown to significantly improve student learning outcomes, it remains a complex labor-intensive task for instructors. Large language models (LLMs) can be used to augment human effort by automatically generating Socratic questions for students. However, existing methods that involve prompting these LLMs sometimes produce invalid outputs, e.g., those that directly reveal the solution to the problem or provide irrelevant or premature questions. To alleviate this problem, inspired by reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), we first propose a data augmentation method to enrich existing Socratic questioning datasets with questions that are invalid in specific ways. Next, we propose a method to optimize open-source LLMs such as LLama 2 to prefer ground-truth questions over generated invalid ones, using direct preference optimization (DPO). Our experiments on a Socratic questions dataset for student code debugging show that a DPO-optimized 7B LLama 2 model can effectively avoid generating invalid questions, and as a result, outperforms existing state-of-the-art prompting methods.</description>

      <title>Fast Benchmarking of Asynchronous Multi-Fidelity Optimization on Zero-Cost Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While deep learning has celebrated many successes, its results often hinge on the meticulous selection of hyperparameters (HPs). However, the time-consuming nature of deep learning training makes HP optimization (HPO) a costly endeavor, slowing down the development of efficient HPO tools. While zero-cost benchmarks, which provide performance and runtime without actual training, offer a solution for non-parallel setups, they fall short in parallel setups as each worker must communicate its queried runtime to return its evaluation in the exact order. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a user-friendly Python package that facilitates efficient parallel HPO with zero-cost benchmarks. Our approach calculates the exact return order based on the information stored in file system, eliminating the need for long waiting times and enabling much faster HPO evaluations. We first verify the correctness of our approach through extensive testing and the experiments with 6 popular HPO libraries show its applicability to diverse libraries and its ability to achieve over 1000x speedup compared to a traditional approach. Our package can be installed via pip install mfhpo-simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualization for explainable and trustworthy machine learning remains one of the most important and heavily researched fields within information visualization and visual analytics with various application domains, such as medicine, finance, and bioinformatics. After our 2020 state-of-the-art report comprising 200 techniques, we have persistently collected peer-reviewed articles describing visualization techniques, categorized them based on the previously established categorization schema consisting of 119 categories, and provided the resulting collection of 542 techniques in an online survey browser. In this survey article, we present the updated findings of new analyses of this dataset as of fall 2023 and discuss trends, insights, and eight open challenges for using visualizations in machine learning. Our results corroborate the rapidly growing trend of visualization techniques for increasing trust in machine learning models in the past three years, with visualization found to help improve popular model explainability methods and check new deep learning architectures, for instance.</description>

      <title>Private graphon estimation via sum-of-squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the first pure node-differentially-private algorithms for learning stochastic block models and for graphon estimation with polynomial running time for any constant number of blocks. The statistical utility guarantees match those of the previous best information-theoretic (exponential-time) node-private mechanisms for these problems. The algorithm is based on an exponential mechanism for a score function defined in terms of a sum-of-squares relaxation whose level depends on the number of blocks. The key ingredients of our results are (1) a characterization of the distance between the block graphons in terms of a quadratic optimization over the polytope of doubly stochastic matrices, (2) a general sum-of-squares convergence result for polynomial optimization over arbitrary polytopes, and (3) a general approach to perform Lipschitz extensions of score functions as part of the sum-of-squares algorithmic paradigm.</description>

      <title>NeRF-MAE: Masked AutoEncoders for Self-Supervised 3D Representation Learning for Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural fields excel in computer vision and robotics due to their ability to understand the 3D visual world such as inferring semantics, geometry, and dynamics. Given the capabilities of neural fields in densely representing a 3D scene from 2D images, we ask the question: Can we scale their self-supervised pretraining, specifically using masked autoencoders, to generate effective 3D representations from posed RGB images. Owing to the astounding success of extending transformers to novel data modalities, we employ standard 3D Vision Transformers to suit the unique formulation of NeRFs. We leverage NeRF's volumetric grid as a dense input to the transformer, contrasting it with other 3D representations such as pointclouds where the information density can be uneven, and the representation is irregular. Due to the difficulty of applying masked autoencoders to an implicit representation, such as NeRF, we opt for extracting an explicit representation that canonicalizes scenes across domains by employing the camera trajectory for sampling. Our goal is made possible by masking random patches from NeRF's radiance and density grid and employing a standard 3D Swin Transformer to reconstruct the masked patches. In doing so, the model can learn the semantic and spatial structure of complete scenes. We pretrain this representation at scale on our proposed curated posed-RGB data, totaling over 1.6 million images. Once pretrained, the encoder is used for effective 3D transfer learning. Our novel self-supervised pretraining for NeRFs, NeRF-MAE, scales remarkably well and improves performance on various challenging 3D tasks. Utilizing unlabeled posed 2D data for pretraining, NeRF-MAE significantly outperforms self-supervised 3D pretraining and NeRF scene understanding baselines on Front3D and ScanNet datasets with an absolute performance improvement of over 20% AP50 and 8% AP25 for 3D object detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new challenge to examine whether large language models understand social norms. In contrast to existing datasets, our dataset requires a fundamental understanding of social norms to solve. Our dataset features the largest set of social norm skills, consisting of 402 skills and 12,383 questions covering a wide set of social norms ranging from opinions and arguments to culture and laws. We design our dataset according to the K-12 curriculum. This enables the direct comparison of the social understanding of large language models to humans, more specifically, elementary students. While prior work generates nearly random accuracy on our benchmark, recent large language models such as GPT3.5-Turbo and LLaMA2-Chat are able to improve the performance significantly, only slightly below human performance. We then propose a multi-agent framework based on large language models to improve the models' ability to understand social norms. This method further improves large language models to be on par with humans. Given the increasing adoption of large language models in real-world applications, our finding is particularly important and presents a unique direction for future improvements. The proposed method and dataset are available in https://huggingface.co/datasets/socialdataset2024/social.</description>

      <title>Language Imbalance Can Boost Cross-lingual Generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07982</link>

Abstract: Multilinguality is crucial for extending recent advancements in language modelling to diverse linguistic communities. To maintain high performance while representing multiple languages, multilingual models ideally align representations, allowing what is learned in one language to generalise to others. Prior research has emphasised the importance of parallel data and shared vocabulary elements as key factors for such alignment. In this study, we investigate an unintuitive novel driver of cross-lingual generalisation: language imbalance. In controlled experiments on perfectly equivalent cloned languages, we observe that the existence of a predominant language during training boosts the performance of less frequent languages and leads to stronger alignment of model representations across languages. Furthermore, we find that this trend is amplified with scale: with large enough models or long enough training, we observe that bilingual training data with a 90/10 language split yields better performance on both languages than a balanced 50/50 split. Building on these insights, we design training schemes that can improve performance in all cloned languages, even without altering the training data. As we extend our analysis to real languages, we find that infrequent languages still benefit from frequent ones, yet whether language imbalance causes cross-lingual generalisation there is not conclusive.</description>

      <title>RoNID: New Intent Discovery with Generated-Reliable Labels and Cluster-friendly Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New Intent Discovery (NID) strives to identify known and reasonably deduce novel intent groups in the open-world scenario. But current methods face issues with inaccurate pseudo-labels and poor representation learning, creating a negative feedback loop that degrades overall model performance, including accuracy and the adjusted rand index. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Robust New Intent Discovery (RoNID) framework optimized by an EM-style method, which focuses on constructing reliable pseudo-labels and obtaining cluster-friendly discriminative representations. RoNID comprises two main modules: reliable pseudo-label generation module and cluster-friendly representation learning module. Specifically, the pseudo-label generation module assigns reliable synthetic labels by solving an optimal transport problem in the E-step, which effectively provides high-quality supervised signals for the input of the cluster-friendly representation learning module. To learn cluster-friendly representation with strong intra-cluster compactness and large inter-cluster separation, the representation learning module combines intra-cluster and inter-cluster contrastive learning in the M-step to feed more discriminative features into the generation module. RoNID can be performed iteratively to ultimately yield a robust model with reliable pseudo-labels and cluster-friendly representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate our method brings substantial improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of +1~+4 points.</description>

      <title>Post-Training Network Compression for 3D Medical Image Segmentation: Reducing Computational Efforts via Tucker Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the computational barrier of deploying advanced deep learning segmentation models in clinical settings by studying the efficacy of network compression through tensor decomposition. We propose a post-training Tucker factorization that enables the decomposition of pre-existing models to reduce computational requirements without impeding segmentation accuracy. We applied Tucker decomposition to the convolutional kernels of the TotalSegmentator (TS) model, an nnU-Net model trained on a comprehensive dataset for automatic segmentation of 117 anatomical structures. Our approach reduced the floating-point operations (FLOPs) and memory required during inference, offering an adjustable trade-off between computational efficiency and segmentation quality. This study utilized the publicly available TS dataset, employing various downsampling factors to explore the relationship between model size, inference speed, and segmentation performance. The application of Tucker decomposition to the TS model substantially reduced the model parameters and FLOPs across various compression rates, with limited loss in segmentation accuracy. We removed up to 88% of the model's parameters with no significant performance changes in the majority of classes after fine-tuning. Practical benefits varied across different graphics processing unit (GPU) architectures, with more distinct speed-ups on less powerful hardware. Post-hoc network compression via Tucker decomposition presents a viable strategy for reducing the computational demand of medical image segmentation models without substantially sacrificing accuracy. This approach enables the broader adoption of advanced deep learning technologies in clinical practice, offering a way to navigate the constraints of hardware capabilities.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Frequency-Based Fingerprinting Attacks against Modern Sandbox Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cloud computing landscape has evolved significantly in recent years, embracing various sandboxes to meet the diverse demands of modern cloud applications. These sandboxes encompass container-based technologies like Docker and gVisor, microVM-based solutions like Firecracker, and security-centric sandboxes relying on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX and AMD SEV. However, the practice of placing multiple tenants on shared physical hardware raises security and privacy concerns, most notably side-channel attacks.
  In this paper, we investigate the possibility of fingerprinting containers through CPU frequency reporting sensors in Intel and AMD CPUs. One key enabler of our attack is that the current CPU frequency information can be accessed by user-space attackers. We demonstrate that Docker images exhibit a unique frequency signature, enabling the distinction of different containers with up to 84.5% accuracy even when multiple containers are running simultaneously in different cores. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of our attack when performed against several sandboxes deployed in cloud environments, including Google's gVisor, AWS' Firecracker, and TEE-based platforms like Gramine (utilizing Intel SGX) and AMD SEV. Our empirical results show that these attacks can also be carried out successfully against all of these sandboxes in less than 40 seconds, with an accuracy of over 70% in all cases. Finally, we propose a noise injection-based countermeasure to mitigate the proposed attack on cloud environments.</description>

      <title>Supervised Contrastive Vision Transformer for Breast Histopathological Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer. Breast tissue histopathological examination is critical in diagnosing and classifying breast cancer. Although existing methods have shown promising results, there is still room for improvement in the classification accuracy and generalization of IDC using histopathology images. We present a novel approach, Supervised Contrastive Vision Transformer (SupCon-ViT), for improving the classification of invasive ductal carcinoma in terms of accuracy and generalization by leveraging the inherent strengths and advantages of both transfer learning, i.e., pre-trained vision transformer, and supervised contrastive learning. Our results on a benchmark breast cancer dataset demonstrate that SupCon-Vit achieves state-of-the-art performance in IDC classification, with an F1-score of 0.8188, precision of 0.7692, and specificity of 0.8971, outperforming existing methods. In addition, the proposed model demonstrates resilience in scenarios with minimal labeled data, making it highly efficient in real-world clinical settings where labelled data is limited. Our findings suggest that supervised contrastive learning in conjunction with pre-trained vision transformers appears to be a viable strategy for an accurate classification of IDC, thus paving the way for a more efficient and reliable diagnosis of breast cancer through histopathological image analysis.</description>
