      <title>NeRFCodec: Neural Feature Compression Meets Neural Radiance Fields for Memory-Efficient Scene Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has greatly impacted 3D scene modeling and novel-view synthesis. As a kind of visual media for 3D scene representation, compression with high rate-distortion performance is an eternal target. Motivated by advances in neural compression and neural field representation, we propose NeRFCodec, an end-to-end NeRF compression framework that integrates non-linear transform, quantization, and entropy coding for memory-efficient scene representation. Since training a non-linear transform directly on a large scale of NeRF feature planes is impractical, we discover that pre-trained neural 2D image codec can be utilized for compressing the features when adding content-specific parameters. Specifically, we reuse neural 2D image codec but modify its encoder and decoder heads, while keeping the other parts of the pre-trained decoder frozen. This allows us to train the full pipeline via supervision of rendering loss and entropy loss, yielding the rate-distortion balance by updating the content-specific parameters. At test time, the bitstreams containing latent code, feature decoder head, and other side information are transmitted for communication. Experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms existing NeRF compression methods, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis with a memory budget of 0.5 MB.</description>

      <title>CHOSEN: Contrastive Hypothesis Selection for Multi-View Depth Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose CHOSEN, a simple yet flexible, robust and effective multi-view depth refinement framework. It can be employed in any existing multi-view stereo pipeline, with straightforward generalization capability for different multi-view capture systems such as camera relative positioning and lenses. Given an initial depth estimation, CHOSEN iteratively re-samples and selects the best hypotheses, and automatically adapts to different metric or intrinsic scales determined by the capture system. The key to our approach is the application of contrastive learning in an appropriate solution space and a carefully designed hypothesis feature, based on which positive and negative hypotheses can be effectively distinguished. Integrated in a simple baseline multi-view stereo pipeline, CHOSEN delivers impressive quality in terms of depth and normal accuracy compared to many current deep learning based multi-view stereo pipelines.</description>

      <title>OOSTraj: Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction With Vision-Positioning Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is fundamental in computer vision and autonomous driving, particularly for understanding pedestrian behavior and enabling proactive decision-making. Existing approaches in this field often assume precise and complete observational data, neglecting the challenges associated with out-of-view objects and the noise inherent in sensor data due to limited camera range, physical obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised sensor data. Such oversights are critical safety concerns, as they can result in missing essential, non-visible objects. To bridge this gap, we present a novel method for out-of-sight trajectory prediction that leverages a vision-positioning technique. Our approach denoises noisy sensor observations in an unsupervised manner and precisely maps sensor-based trajectories of out-of-sight objects into visual trajectories. This method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in out-of-sight noisy sensor trajectory denoising and prediction on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets. By enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy and addressing the challenges of out-of-sight objects, our work significantly contributes to improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving in complex environments. Our work represents the first initiative towards Out-Of-Sight Trajectory prediction (OOSTraj), setting a new benchmark for future research.

      <title>Visual Concept Connectome (VCC): Open World Concept Discovery and their Interlayer Connections in Deep Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what deep network models capture in their learned representations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. We present a new methodology to understanding such vision models, the Visual Concept Connectome (VCC), which discovers human interpretable concepts and their interlayer connections in a fully unsupervised manner. Our approach simultaneously reveals fine-grained concepts at a layer, connection weightings across all layers and is amendable to global analysis of network structure (e.g., branching pattern of hierarchical concept assemblies). Previous work yielded ways to extract interpretable concepts from single layers and examine their impact on classification, but did not afford multilayer concept analysis across an entire network architecture. Quantitative and qualitative empirical results show the effectiveness of VCCs in the domain of image classification. Also, we leverage VCCs for the application of failure mode debugging to reveal where mistakes arise in deep networks.</description>

      <title>Linear Combination of Saved Checkpoints Makes Consistency and Diffusion Models Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DM) and Consistency Models (CM) are two types of popular generative models with good generation quality on various tasks. When training DM and CM, intermediate weight checkpoints are not fully utilized and only the last converged checkpoint is used. In this work, we find that high-quality model weights often lie in a basin which cannot be reached by SGD but can be obtained by proper checkpoint averaging. Based on these observations, we propose LCSC, a simple but effective and efficient method to enhance the performance of DM and CM, by combining checkpoints along the training trajectory with coefficients deduced from evolutionary search. We demonstrate the value of LCSC through two use cases: $\textbf{(a) Reducing training cost.}$ With LCSC, we only need to train DM/CM with fewer number of iterations and/or lower batch sizes to obtain comparable sample quality with the fully trained model. For example, LCSC achieves considerable training speedups for CM (23$\times$ on CIFAR-10 and 15$\times$ on ImageNet-64). $\textbf{(b) Enhancing pre-trained models.}$ Assuming full training is already done, LCSC can further improve the generation quality or speed of the final converged models. For example, LCSC achieves better performance using 1 number of function evaluation (NFE) than the base model with 2 NFE on consistency distillation, and decreases the NFE of DM from 15 to 9 while maintaining the generation quality on CIFAR-10. Our code is available at https://github.com/imagination-research/LCSC.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust 3D Pose Transfer with Adversarial Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D pose transfer that aims to transfer the desired pose to a target mesh is one of the most challenging 3D generation tasks. Previous attempts rely on well-defined parametric human models or skeletal joints as driving pose sources. However, to obtain those clean pose sources, cumbersome but necessary pre-processing pipelines are inevitable, hindering implementations of the real-time applications. This work is driven by the intuition that the robustness of the model can be enhanced by introducing adversarial samples into the training, leading to a more invulnerable model to the noisy inputs, which even can be further extended to directly handling the real-world data like raw point clouds/scans without intermediate processing. Furthermore, we propose a novel 3D pose Masked Autoencoder (3D-PoseMAE), a customized MAE that effectively learns 3D extrinsic presentations (i.e., pose). 3D-PoseMAE facilitates learning from the aspect of extrinsic attributes by simultaneously generating adversarial samples that perturb the model and learning the arbitrary raw noisy poses via a multi-scale masking strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that the transferred meshes given by our network result in much better quality. Besides, we demonstrate the strong generalizability of our method on various poses, different domains, and even raw scans. Experimental results also show meaningful insights that the intermediate adversarial samples generated in the training can successfully attack the existing pose transfer models.</description>

      <title>SnAG: Scalable and Accurate Video Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal grounding of text descriptions in videos is a central problem in vision-language learning and video understanding. Existing methods often prioritize accuracy over scalability -- they have been optimized for grounding only a few text queries within short videos, and fail to scale up to long videos with hundreds of queries. In this paper, we study the effect of cross-modal fusion on the scalability of video grounding models. Our analysis establishes late fusion as a more cost-effective fusion scheme for long-form videos with many text queries. Moreover, it leads us to a novel, video-centric sampling scheme for efficient training. Based on these findings, we present SnAG, a simple baseline for scalable and accurate video grounding. Without bells and whistles, SnAG is 43% more accurate and 1.5x faster than CONE, a state of the art for long-form video grounding on the challenging MAD dataset, while achieving highly competitive results on short videos.</description>

      <title>OFMPNet: Deep End-to-End Model for Occupancy and Flow Prediction in Urban Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of motion prediction is pivotal for autonomous driving systems, providing crucial data to choose a vehicle behavior strategy within its surroundings. Existing motion prediction techniques primarily focus on predicting the future trajectory of each agent in the scene individually, utilizing its past trajectory data. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end neural network methodology designed to predict the future behaviors of all dynamic objects in the environment. This approach leverages the occupancy map and the scene's motion flow. We are investigatin various alternatives for constructing a deep encoder-decoder model called OFMPNet. This model uses a sequence of bird's-eye-view road images, occupancy grid, and prior motion flow as input data. The encoder of the model can incorporate transformer, attention-based, or convolutional units. The decoder considers the use of both convolutional modules and recurrent blocks. Additionally, we propose a novel time-weighted motion flow loss, whose application has shown a substantial decrease in end-point error. Our approach has achieved state-of-the-art results on the Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction benchmark, with a Soft IoU of 52.1% and an AUC of 76.75% on Flow-Grounded Occupancy.</description>

      <title>Smooth Deep Saliency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate methods to reduce the noise in deep saliency maps coming from convolutional downsampling, with the purpose of explaining how a deep learning model detects tumors in scanned histological tissue samples. Those methods make the investigated models more interpretable for gradient-based saliency maps, computed in hidden layers. We test our approach on different models trained for image classification on ImageNet1K, and models trained for tumor detection on Camelyon16 and in-house real-world digital pathology scans of stained tissue samples. Our results show that the checkerboard noise in the gradient gets reduced, resulting in smoother and therefore easier to interpret saliency maps.</description>

      <title>LP++: A Surprisingly Strong Linear Probe for Few-Shot CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent, strongly emergent literature on few-shot CLIP adaptation, Linear Probe (LP) has been often reported as a weak baseline. This has motivated intensive research building convoluted prompt learning or feature adaptation strategies. In this work, we propose and examine from convex-optimization perspectives a generalization of the standard LP baseline, in which the linear classifier weights are learnable functions of the text embedding, with class-wise multipliers blending image and text knowledge. As our objective function depends on two types of variables, i.e., the class visual prototypes and the learnable blending parameters, we propose a computationally efficient block coordinate Majorize-Minimize (MM) descent algorithm. In our full-batch MM optimizer, which we coin LP++, step sizes are implicit, unlike standard gradient descent practices where learning rates are intensively searched over validation sets. By examining the mathematical properties of our loss (e.g., Lipschitz gradient continuity), we build majorizing functions yielding data-driven learning rates and derive approximations of the loss's minima, which provide data-informed initialization of the variables. Our image-language objective function, along with these non-trivial optimization insights and ingredients, yields, surprisingly, highly competitive few-shot CLIP performances. Furthermore, LP++ operates in black-box, relaxes intensive validation searches for the optimization hyper-parameters, and runs orders-of-magnitudes faster than state-of-the-art few-shot CLIP adaptation methods. Our code is available at: \url{https://github.com/FereshteShakeri/FewShot-CLIP-Strong-Baseline.git}.</description>

      <title>One Noise to Rule Them All: Multi-View Adversarial Attacks with Universal Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel universal perturbation method for generating robust multi-view adversarial examples in 3D object recognition. Unlike conventional attacks limited to single views, our approach operates on multiple 2D images, offering a practical and scalable solution for enhancing model scalability and robustness. This generalizable method bridges the gap between 2D perturbations and 3D-like attack capabilities, making it suitable for real-world applications.
  Existing adversarial attacks may become ineffective when images undergo transformations like changes in lighting, camera position, or natural deformations. We address this challenge by crafting a single universal noise perturbation applicable to various object views. Experiments on diverse rendered 3D objects demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The universal perturbation successfully identified a single adversarial noise for each given set of 3D object renders from multiple poses and viewpoints. Compared to single-view attacks, our universal attacks lower classification confidence across multiple viewing angles, especially at low noise levels. A sample implementation is made available at https://github.com/memoatwit/UniversalPerturbation.</description>

      <title>GaitSTR: Gait Recognition with Sequential Two-stream Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify a person based on their walking sequences, serving as a useful biometric modality as it can be observed from long distances without requiring cooperation from the subject. In representing a person's walking sequence, silhouettes and skeletons are the two primary modalities used. Silhouette sequences lack detailed part information when overlapping occurs between different body segments and are affected by carried objects and clothing. Skeletons, comprising joints and bones connecting the joints, provide more accurate part information for different segments; however, they are sensitive to occlusions and low-quality images, causing inconsistencies in frame-wise results within a sequence. In this paper, we explore the use of a two-stream representation of skeletons for gait recognition, alongside silhouettes. By fusing the combined data of silhouettes and skeletons, we refine the two-stream skeletons, joints, and bones through self-correction in graph convolution, along with cross-modal correction with temporal consistency from silhouettes. We demonstrate that with refined skeletons, the performance of the gait recognition model can achieve further improvement on public gait recognition datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods without extra annotations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning models are incredibly data-hungry and require very large labeled datasets for supervised learning. As a consequence, these models often suffer from overfitting, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world examples. Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic images based on textual inputs. Leveraging the substantial datasets used to train these diffusion models, we propose a technique to utilize generated images to augment existing datasets. This paper explores various strategies for effective data augmentation to improve the out-of-domain generalization capabilities of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Human-Computer Interaction in Chest X-ray Analysis using Vision and Language Model with Eye Gaze Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Computer Assisted Diagnosis have shown promising performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly in chest X-ray analysis. However, the interaction between these models and radiologists has been primarily limited to input images. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance human-computer interaction in chest X-ray analysis using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enhanced with radiologists' attention by incorporating eye gaze data alongside textual prompts. Our approach leverages heatmaps generated from eye gaze data, overlaying them onto medical images to highlight areas of intense radiologist's focus during chest X-ray evaluation. We evaluate this methodology in tasks such as visual question answering, chest X-ray report automation, error detection, and differential diagnosis. Our results demonstrate the inclusion of eye gaze information significantly enhances the accuracy of chest X-ray analysis. Also, the impact of eye gaze on fine-tuning was confirmed as it outperformed other medical VLMs in all tasks except visual question answering. This work marks the potential of leveraging both the VLM's capabilities and the radiologist's domain knowledge to improve the capabilities of AI models in medical imaging, paving a novel way for Computer Assisted Diagnosis with a human-centred AI.</description>

      <title>CAPE: CAM as a Probabilistic Ensemble for Enhanced DNN Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for visual classification tasks, but their complex computation process and black-box nature hinder decision transparency and interpretability. Class activation maps (CAMs) and recent variants provide ways to visually explain the DNN decision-making process by displaying 'attention' heatmaps of the DNNs. Nevertheless, the CAM explanation only offers relative attention information, that is, on an attention heatmap, we can interpret which image region is more or less important than the others. However, these regions cannot be meaningfully compared across classes, and the contribution of each region to the model's class prediction is not revealed. To address these challenges that ultimately lead to better DNN Interpretation, in this paper, we propose CAPE, a novel reformulation of CAM that provides a unified and probabilistically meaningful assessment of the contributions of image regions. We quantitatively and qualitatively compare CAPE with state-of-the-art CAM methods on CUB and ImageNet benchmark datasets to demonstrate enhanced interpretability. We also test on a cytology imaging dataset depicting a challenging Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) diagnosis problem. Code is available at: https://github.com/AIML-MED/CAPE.</description>

Abstract: The benefits of having digital twins of urban buildings are numerous. However, a major difficulty encountered in their creation from airborne LiDAR point clouds is the effective means of accurately reconstructing significant occlusions amidst point density variations and noise. To bridge the noise/sparsity/occlusion gap and generate high fidelity 3D building models, we propose APC2Mesh which integrates point completion into a 3D reconstruction pipeline, enabling the learning of dense geometrically accurate representation of buildings. Specifically, we leveraged complete points generated from occluded ones as input to a linearized skip attention-based deformation network for 3D mesh reconstruction. In our experiments, conducted on 3 different scenes, we demonstrate that: (1) APC2Mesh delivers comparatively superior results, indicating its efficacy in handling the challenges of occluded airborne building points of diverse styles and complexities. (2) The combination of point completion with typical deep learning-based 3D point cloud reconstruction methods offers a direct and effective solution for reconstructing significantly occluded airborne building points. As such, this neural integration holds promise for advancing the creation of digital twins for urban buildings with greater accuracy and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion-based Point Cloud Generation with Smoothness Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been popular for point cloud generation tasks. Existing works utilize the forward diffusion process to convert the original point distribution into a noise distribution and then learn the reverse diffusion process to recover the point distribution from the noise distribution. However, the reverse diffusion process can produce samples with non-smooth points on the surface because of the ignorance of the point cloud geometric properties. We propose alleviating the problem by incorporating the local smoothness constraint into the diffusion framework for point cloud generation. Experiments demonstrate the proposed model can generate realistic shapes and smoother point clouds, outperforming multiple state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>TE-TAD: Towards Full End-to-End Temporal Action Detection via Time-Aligned Coordinate Expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate that the normalized coordinate expression is a key factor as reliance on hand-crafted components in query-based detectors for temporal action detection (TAD). Despite significant advancements towards an end-to-end framework in object detection, query-based detectors have been limited in achieving full end-to-end modeling in TAD. To address this issue, we propose \modelname{}, a full end-to-end temporal action detection transformer that integrates time-aligned coordinate expression. We reformulate coordinate expression utilizing actual timeline values, ensuring length-invariant representations from the extremely diverse video duration environment. Furthermore, our proposed adaptive query selection dynamically adjusts the number of queries based on video length, providing a suitable solution for varying video durations compared to a fixed query set. Our approach not only simplifies the TAD process by eliminating the need for hand-crafted components but also significantly improves the performance of query-based detectors. Our TE-TAD outperforms the previous query-based detectors and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets.

      <title>TCLC-GS: Tightly Coupled LiDAR-Camera Gaussian Splatting for Surrounding Autonomous Driving Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods for urban scenes initialize 3D Gaussians directly with 3D LiDAR points, which not only underutilizes LiDAR data capabilities but also overlooks the potential advantages of fusing LiDAR with camera data. In this paper, we design a novel tightly coupled LiDAR-Camera Gaussian Splatting (TCLC-GS) to fully leverage the combined strengths of both LiDAR and camera sensors, enabling rapid, high-quality 3D reconstruction and novel view RGB/depth synthesis. TCLC-GS designs a hybrid explicit (colorized 3D mesh) and implicit (hierarchical octree feature) 3D representation derived from LiDAR-camera data, to enrich the properties of 3D Gaussians for splatting. 3D Gaussian's properties are not only initialized in alignment with the 3D mesh which provides more completed 3D shape and color information, but are also endowed with broader contextual information through retrieved octree implicit features. During the Gaussian Splatting optimization process, the 3D mesh offers dense depth information as supervision, which enhances the training process by learning of a robust geometry. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes Dataset validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Utilizing a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti, our method demonstrates fast training and achieves real-time RGB and depth rendering at 90 FPS in resolution of 1920x1280 (Waymo), and 120 FPS in resolution of 1600x900 (nuScenes) in urban scenarios.</description>

      <title>What Are We Measuring When We Evaluate Large Vision-Language Models? An Analysis of Latent Factors and Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language (VL) models, pretrained on colossal image-text datasets, have attained broad VL competence that is difficult to evaluate. A common belief is that a small number of VL skills underlie the variety of VL tests. In this paper, we perform a large-scale transfer learning experiment aimed at discovering latent VL skills from data. We reveal interesting characteristics that have important implications for test suite design. First, generation tasks suffer from a length bias, suggesting benchmarks should balance tasks with varying output lengths. Second, we demonstrate that factor analysis successfully identifies reasonable yet surprising VL skill factors, suggesting benchmarks could leverage similar analyses for task selection. Finally, we present a new dataset, OLIVE (https://github.com/jq-zh/olive-dataset), which simulates user instructions in the wild and presents challenges dissimilar to all datasets we tested. Our findings contribute to the design of balanced and broad-coverage vision-language evaluation methods.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification Using Cross-Colour Space Feature Fusion and Quantum-Classical Stack Ensemble Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer classification stands as a pivotal pillar in ensuring timely diagnosis and effective treatment. This study with histopathological images underscores the profound significance of harnessing the synergistic capabilities of colour space ensembling and quantum-classical stacking to elevate the precision of breast cancer classification. By delving into the distinct colour spaces of RGB, HSV and CIE L*u*v, the authors initiated a comprehensive investigation guided by advanced methodologies. Employing the DenseNet121 architecture for feature extraction the authors have capitalized on the robustness of Random Forest, SVM, QSVC, and VQC classifiers. This research encompasses a unique feature fusion technique within the colour space ensemble. This approach not only deepens our comprehension of breast cancer classification but also marks a milestone in personalized medical assessment. The amalgamation of quantum and classical classifiers through stacking emerges as a potent catalyst, effectively mitigating the inherent constraints of individual classifiers, paving a robust path towards more dependable and refined breast cancer identification. Through rigorous experimentation and meticulous analysis, fusion of colour spaces like RGB with HSV and RGB with CIE L*u*v, presents an classification accuracy, nearing the value of unity. This underscores the transformative potential of our approach, where the fusion of diverse colour spaces and the synergy of quantum and classical realms converge to establish a new horizon in medical diagnostics. Thus the implications of this research extend across medical disciplines, offering promising avenues for advancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy.</description>

      <title>RS3Mamba: Visual State Space Model for Remote Sensing Images Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is a fundamental task in geoscience research. However, there are some significant shortcomings for the widely used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers. The former is limited by its insufficient long-range modeling capabilities, while the latter is hampered by its computational complexity. Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model represented by Mamba has emerged, capable of modeling long-range relationships with linear computability. In this work, we propose a novel dual-branch network named remote sensing images semantic segmentation Mamba (RS3Mamba) to incorporate this innovative technology into remote sensing tasks. Specifically, RS3Mamba utilizes VSS blocks to construct an auxiliary branch, providing additional global information to convolution-based main branch. Moreover, considering the distinct characteristics of the two branches, we introduce a collaborative completion module (CCM) to enhance and fuse features from the dual-encoder. Experimental results on two widely used datasets, ISPRS Vaihingen and LoveDA Urban, demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed RS3Mamba. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first vision Mamba specifically designed for remote sensing images semantic segmentation. The source code will be made available at https://github.com/sstary/SSRS.</description>

      <title>TSNet:A Two-stage Network for Image Dehazing with Multi-scale Fusion and Adaptive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image dehazing has been a popular topic of research for a long time. Previous deep learning-based image dehazing methods have failed to achieve satisfactory dehazing effects on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets, exhibiting poor generalization. Moreover, single-stage networks often result in many regions with artifacts and color distortion in output images. To address these issues, this paper proposes a two-stage image dehazing network called TSNet, mainly consisting of the multi-scale fusion module (MSFM) and the adaptive learning module (ALM). Specifically, MSFM and ALM enhance the generalization of TSNet. The MSFM can obtain large receptive fields at multiple scales and integrate features at different frequencies to reduce the differences between inputs and learning objectives. The ALM can actively learn of regions of interest in images and restore texture details more effectively. Additionally, TSNet is designed as a two-stage network, where the first-stage network performs image dehazing, and the second-stage network is employed to improve issues such as artifacts and color distortion present in the results of the first-stage network. We also change the learning objective from ground truth images to opposite fog maps, which improves the learning efficiency of TSNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSNet exhibits superior dehazing performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Unified Membership Inference Method for Visual Self-supervised Encoder via Part-aware Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning shows promise in harnessing extensive unlabeled data, but it also confronts significant privacy concerns, especially in vision. In this paper, we aim to perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to query responses with the image in representation space. We conduct extensive attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range. The defense experiments indicate that all of them are effective. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiePKU/PartCrop</description>

      <title>VIAssist: Adapting Multi-modal Large Language Models for Users with Visual Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals with visual impairments, encompassing both partial and total difficulties in visual perception, are referred to as visually impaired (VI) people. An estimated 2.2 billion individuals worldwide are affected by visual impairments. Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have showcased their extraordinary capabilities across various domains. It is desirable to help VI individuals with MLLMs' great capabilities of visual understanding and reasoning. However, it is challenging for VI people to use MLLMs due to the difficulties in capturing the desirable images to fulfill their daily requests. For example, the target object is not fully or partially placed in the image. This paper explores how to leverage MLLMs for VI individuals to provide visual-question answers. VIAssist can identify undesired images and provide detailed actions. Finally, VIAssist can provide reliable answers to users' queries based on the images. Our results show that VIAssist provides +0.21 and +0.31 higher BERTScore and ROUGE scores than the baseline, respectively.</description>

      <title>Freditor: High-Fidelity and Transferable NeRF Editing by Frequency Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper enables high-fidelity, transferable NeRF editing by frequency decomposition. Recent NeRF editing pipelines lift 2D stylization results to 3D scenes while suffering from blurry results, and fail to capture detailed structures caused by the inconsistency between 2D editings. Our critical insight is that low-frequency components of images are more multiview-consistent after editing compared with their high-frequency parts. Moreover, the appearance style is mainly exhibited on the low-frequency components, and the content details especially reside in high-frequency parts. This motivates us to perform editing on low-frequency components, which results in high-fidelity edited scenes. In addition, the editing is performed in the low-frequency feature space, enabling stable intensity control and novel scene transfer. Comprehensive experiments conducted on photorealistic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of high-fidelity and transferable NeRF editing.

      <title>HENet: Hybrid Encoding for End-to-end Multi-task 3D Perception from Multi-view Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional perception from multi-view cameras is a crucial component in autonomous driving systems, which involves multiple tasks like 3D object detection and bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation. To improve perception precision, large image encoders, high-resolution images, and long-term temporal inputs have been adopted in recent 3D perception models, bringing remarkable performance gains. However, these techniques are often incompatible in training and inference scenarios due to computational resource constraints. Besides, modern autonomous driving systems prefer to adopt an end-to-end framework for multi-task 3D perception, which can simplify the overall system architecture and reduce the implementation complexity. However, conflict between tasks often arises when optimizing multiple tasks jointly within an end-to-end 3D perception model. To alleviate these issues, we present an end-to-end framework named HENet for multi-task 3D perception in this paper. Specifically, we propose a hybrid image encoding network, using a large image encoder for short-term frames and a small image encoder for long-term temporal frames. Then, we introduce a temporal feature integration module based on the attention mechanism to fuse the features of different frames extracted by the two aforementioned hybrid image encoders. Finally, according to the characteristics of each perception task, we utilize BEV features of different grid sizes, independent BEV encoders, and task decoders for different tasks. Experimental results show that HENet achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end multi-task 3D perception results on the nuScenes benchmark, including 3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation. The source code and models will be released at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/HENet.</description>

      <title>Text-driven Affordance Learning from Egocentric Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual affordance learning is a key component for robots to understand how to interact with objects. Conventional approaches in this field rely on pre-defined objects and actions, falling short of capturing diverse interactions in realworld scenarios. The key idea of our approach is employing textual instruction, targeting various affordances for a wide range of objects. This approach covers both hand-object and tool-object interactions. We introduce text-driven affordance learning, aiming to learn contact points and manipulation trajectories from an egocentric view following textual instruction. In our task, contact points are represented as heatmaps, and the manipulation trajectory as sequences of coordinates that incorporate both linear and rotational movements for various manipulations. However, when we gather data for this task, manual annotations of these diverse interactions are costly. To this end, we propose a pseudo dataset creation pipeline and build a large pseudo-training dataset: TextAFF80K, consisting of over 80K instances of the contact points, trajectories, images, and text tuples. We extend existing referring expression comprehension models for our task, and experimental results show that our approach robustly handles multiple affordances, serving as a new standard for affordance learning in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Weakly-Supervised 3D Scene Graph Generation via Visual-Linguistic Assisted Pseudo-labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to build 3D scene graphs is essential for real-world perception in a structured and rich fashion. However, previous 3D scene graph generation methods utilize a fully supervised learning manner and require a large amount of entity-level annotation data of objects and relations, which is extremely resource-consuming and tedious to obtain. To tackle this problem, we propose 3D-VLAP, a weakly-supervised 3D scene graph generation method via Visual-Linguistic Assisted Pseudo-labeling. Specifically, our 3D-VLAP exploits the superior ability of current large-scale visual-linguistic models to align the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds. First, we establish the positional correspondence from 3D point clouds to 2D images via camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, thereby achieving alignment of 3D point clouds and 2D images. Subsequently, a large-scale cross-modal visual-linguistic model is employed to indirectly align 3D instances with the textual category labels of objects by matching 2D images with object category labels. The pseudo labels for objects and relations are then produced for 3D-VLAP model training by calculating the similarity between visual embeddings and textual category embeddings of objects and relations encoded by the visual-linguistic model, respectively. Ultimately, we design an edge self-attention based graph neural network to generate scene graphs of 3D point cloud scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 3D-VLAP achieves comparable results with current advanced fully supervised methods, meanwhile significantly alleviating the pressure of data annotation.</description>

      <title>Severity Controlled Text-to-Image Generative Model Bias Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are gaining wide popularity, especially in public domains. However, their intrinsic bias and potential malicious manipulations remain under-explored. Charting the susceptibility of T2I models to such manipulation, we first expose the new possibility of a dynamic and computationally efficient exploitation of model bias by targeting the embedded language models. By leveraging mathematical foundations of vector algebra, our technique enables a scalable and convenient control over the severity of output manipulation through model bias. As a by-product, this control also allows a form of precise prompt engineering to generate images which are generally implausible with regular text prompts. We also demonstrate a constructive application of our manipulation for balancing the frequency of generated classes - as in model debiasing. Our technique does not require training and is also framed as a backdoor attack with severity control using semantically-null text triggers in the prompts. With extensive analysis, we present interesting qualitative and quantitative results to expose potential manipulation possibilities for T2I models.

      <title>Semi-Supervised Unconstrained Head Pose Estimation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing head pose estimation datasets are either composed of numerous samples by non-realistic synthesis or lab collection, or limited images by labor-intensive annotating. This makes deep supervised learning based solutions compromised due to the reliance on generous labeled data. To alleviate it, we propose the first semi-supervised unconstrained head pose estimation (SemiUHPE) method, which can leverage a large amount of unlabeled wild head images. Specifically, we follow the recent semi-supervised rotation regression, and focus on the diverse and complex head pose domain. Firstly, we claim that the aspect-ratio invariant cropping of heads is superior to the previous landmark-based affine alignment, which does not fit unlabeled natural heads or practical applications where landmarks are often unavailable. Then, instead of using an empirically fixed threshold to filter out pseudo labels, we propose the dynamic entropy-based filtering by updating thresholds for adaptively removing unlabeled outliers. Moreover, we revisit the design of weak-strong augmentations, and further exploit its superiority by devising two novel head-oriented strong augmentations named pose-irrelevant cut-occlusion and pose-altering rotation consistency. Extensive experiments show that SemiUHPE can surpass SOTAs with remarkable improvements on public benchmarks under both front-range and full-range. Our code is released in \url{https://github.com/hnuzhy/SemiUHPE}.</description>

      <title>Regional biases in image geolocation estimation: a case study with the SenseCity Africa dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in Artificial Intelligence are challenged by the biases rooted in the datasets used to train the models. In image geolocation estimation, models are mostly trained using data from specific geographic regions, notably the Western world, and as a result, they may struggle to comprehend the complexities of underrepresented regions. To assess this issue, we apply a state-of-the-art image geolocation estimation model (ISNs) to a crowd-sourced dataset of geolocated images from the African continent (SCA100), and then explore the regional and socioeconomic biases underlying the model's predictions. Our findings show that the ISNs model tends to over-predict image locations in high-income countries of the Western world, which is consistent with the geographic distribution of its training data, i.e., the IM2GPS3k dataset. Accordingly, when compared to the IM2GPS3k benchmark, the accuracy of the ISNs model notably decreases at all scales. Additionally, we cluster images of the SCA100 dataset based on how accurately they are predicted by the ISNs model and show the model's difficulties in correctly predicting the locations of images in low income regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, our results suggest that using IM2GPS3k as a training set and benchmark for image geolocation estimation and other computer vision models overlooks its potential application in the African context.</description>

      <title>Representation Alignment Contrastive Regularization for Multi-Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-performance in multi-object tracking algorithms heavily relies on modeling spatio-temporal relationships during the data association stage. Mainstream approaches encompass rule-based and deep learning-based methods for spatio-temporal relationship modeling. While the former relies on physical motion laws, offering wider applicability but yielding suboptimal results for complex object movements, the latter, though achieving high-performance, lacks interpretability and involves complex module designs. This work aims to simplify deep learning-based spatio-temporal relationship models and introduce interpretability into features for data association. Specifically, a lightweight single-layer transformer encoder is utilized to model spatio-temporal relationships. To make features more interpretative, two contrastive regularization losses based on representation alignment are proposed, derived from spatio-temporal consistency rules. By applying weighted summation to affinity matrices, the aligned features can seamlessly integrate into the data association stage of the original tracking workflow. Experimental results showcase that our model enhances the majority of existing tracking networks' performance without excessive complexity, with minimal increase in training overhead and nearly negligible computational and storage costs.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation with Multi-granularity Mixture of Priors for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising yet challenging model compression technique that transfers rich learning representations from a well-performing but cumbersome teacher model to a compact student model. Previous methods for image super-resolution (SR) mostly compare the feature maps directly or after standardizing the dimensions with basic algebraic operations (e.g. average, dot-product). However, the intrinsic semantic differences among feature maps are overlooked, which are caused by the disparate expressive capacity between the networks. This work presents MiPKD, a multi-granularity mixture of prior KD framework, to facilitate efficient SR model through the feature mixture in a unified latent space and stochastic network block mixture. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MiPKD method.</description>

      <title>Active learning for efficient annotation in precision agriculture: a use-case on crop-weed semantic segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing deep learning models requires large amounts of annotated images, a process that is both time-intensive and costly. Especially for semantic segmentation models in which every pixel must be annotated. A potential strategy to mitigate annotation effort is active learning. Active learning facilitates the identification and selection of the most informative images from a large unlabelled pool. The underlying premise is that these selected images can improve the model's performance faster than random selection to reduce annotation effort. While active learning has demonstrated promising results on benchmark datasets like Cityscapes, its performance in the agricultural domain remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this research gap by conducting a comparative study of three active learning-based acquisition functions: Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD), stochastic-based BALD (PowerBALD), and Random. The acquisition functions were tested on two agricultural datasets: Sugarbeet and Corn-Weed, both containing three semantic classes: background, crop and weed. Our results indicated that active learning, especially PowerBALD, yields a higher performance than Random sampling on both datasets. But due to the relatively large standard deviations, the differences observed were minimal; this was partly caused by high image redundancy and imbalanced classes. Specifically, more than 89\% of the pixels belonged to the background class on both datasets. The absence of significant results on both datasets indicates that further research is required for applying active learning on agricultural datasets, especially if they contain a high-class imbalance and redundant images. Recommendations and insights are provided in this paper to potentially resolve such issues.</description>

      <title>Unsegment Anything by Simulating Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation segmentation models, while powerful, pose a significant risk: they enable users to effortlessly extract any objects from any digital content with a single click, potentially leading to copyright infringement or malicious misuse. To mitigate this risk, we introduce a new task "Anything Unsegmentable" to grant any image "the right to be unsegmented". The ambitious pursuit of the task is to achieve highly transferable adversarial attacks against all prompt-based segmentation models, regardless of model parameterizations and prompts. We highlight the non-transferable and heterogeneous nature of prompt-specific adversarial noises. Our approach focuses on disrupting image encoder features to achieve prompt-agnostic attacks. Intriguingly, targeted feature attacks exhibit better transferability compared to untargeted ones, suggesting the optimal update direction aligns with the image manifold. Based on the observations, we design a novel attack named Unsegment Anything by Simulating Deformation (UAD). Our attack optimizes a differentiable deformation function to create a target deformed image, which alters structural information while preserving achievable feature distance by adversarial example. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our approach, compromising a variety of promptable segmentation models with different architectures and prompt interfaces. We release the code at https://github.com/jiahaolu97/anything-unsegmentable.</description>

      <title>Neural Radiance Fields with Torch Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) give rise to learning-based 3D reconstruction methods widely used in industrial applications. Although prevalent methods achieve considerable improvements in small-scale scenes, accomplishing reconstruction in complex and large-scale scenes is still challenging. First, the background in complex scenes shows a large variance among different views. Second, the current inference pattern, $i.e.$, a pixel only relies on an individual camera ray, fails to capture contextual information. To solve these problems, we propose to enlarge the ray perception field and build up the sample points interactions. In this paper, we design a novel inference pattern that encourages a single camera ray possessing more contextual information, and models the relationship among sample points on each camera ray. To hold contextual information,a camera ray in our proposed method can render a patch of pixels simultaneously. Moreover, we replace the MLP in neural radiance field models with distance-aware convolutions to enhance the feature propagation among sample points from the same camera ray. To summarize, as a torchlight, a ray in our proposed method achieves rendering a patch of image. Thus, we call the proposed method, Torch-NeRF. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and LLFF show that the Torch-NeRF exhibits excellent performance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DiffExplainer, a novel framework that, leveraging language-vision models, enables multimodal global explainability. DiffExplainer employs diffusion models conditioned on optimized text prompts, synthesizing images that maximize class outputs and hidden features of a classifier, thus providing a visual tool for explaining decisions. Moreover, the analysis of generated visual descriptions allows for automatic identification of biases and spurious features, as opposed to traditional methods that often rely on manual intervention. The cross-modal transferability of language-vision models also enables the possibility to describe decisions in a more human-interpretable way, i.e., through text. We conduct comprehensive experiments, which include an extensive user study, demonstrating the effectiveness of DiffExplainer on 1) the generation of high-quality images explaining model decisions, surpassing existing activation maximization methods, and 2) the automated identification of biases and spurious features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeleton-based gesture recognition methods have achieved high success using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). In addition, context-dependent adaptive topology as a neighborhood vertex information and attention mechanism leverages a model to better represent actions. In this paper, we propose self-attention GCN hybrid model, Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal self-attention (MSST)-GCN to effectively improve modeling ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on several datasets. We utilize spatial self-attention module with adaptive topology to understand intra-frame interactions within a frame among different body parts, and temporal self-attention module to examine correlations between frames of a node. These two are followed by multi-scale convolution network with dilations, which not only captures the long-range temporal dependencies of joints but also the long-range spatial dependencies (i.e., long-distance dependencies) of node temporal behaviors. They are combined into high-level spatial-temporal representations and output the predicted action with the softmax classifier.</description>

      <title>3DStyleGLIP: Part-Tailored Text-Guided 3D Neural Stylization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D stylization, which entails the application of specific styles to three-dimensional objects, holds significant commercial potential as it enables the creation of diverse 3D objects with distinct moods and styles, tailored to specific demands of different scenes. With recent advancements in text-driven methods and artificial intelligence, the stylization process is increasingly intuitive and automated, thereby diminishing the reliance on manual labor and expertise. However, existing methods have predominantly focused on holistic stylization, thereby leaving the application of styles to individual components of a 3D object unexplored. In response, we introduce 3DStyleGLIP, a novel framework specifically designed for text-driven, part-tailored 3D stylization. Given a 3D mesh and a text prompt, 3DStyleGLIP leverages the vision-language embedding space of the Grounded Language-Image Pre-training (GLIP) model to localize the individual parts of the 3D mesh and modify their colors and local geometries to align them with the desired styles specified in the text prompt. 3DStyleGLIP is effectively trained for 3D stylization tasks through a part-level style loss working in GLIP's embedding space, supplemented by two complementary learning techniques. Extensive experimental validation confirms that our method achieves significant part-wise stylization capabilities, demonstrating promising potential in advancing the field of 3D stylization.</description>

      <title>SG-BEV: Satellite-Guided BEV Fusion for Cross-View Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at achieving fine-grained building attribute segmentation in a cross-view scenario, i.e., using satellite and street-view image pairs. The main challenge lies in overcoming the significant perspective differences between street views and satellite views. In this work, we introduce SG-BEV, a novel approach for satellite-guided BEV fusion for cross-view semantic segmentation. To overcome the limitations of existing cross-view projection methods in capturing the complete building facade features, we innovatively incorporate Bird's Eye View (BEV) method to establish a spatially explicit mapping of street-view features. Moreover, we fully leverage the advantages of multiple perspectives by introducing a novel satellite-guided reprojection module, optimizing the uneven feature distribution issues associated with traditional BEV methods. Our method demonstrates significant improvements on four cross-view datasets collected from multiple cities, including New York, San Francisco, and Boston. On average across these datasets, our method achieves an increase in mIOU by 10.13% and 5.21% compared with the state-of-the-art satellite-based and cross-view methods. The code and datasets of this work will be released at https://github.com/yejy53/SG-BEV.</description>

      <title>Non-negative Subspace Feature Representation for Few-shot Learning in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike typical visual scene recognition domains, in which massive datasets are accessible to deep neural networks, medical image interpretations are often obstructed by the paucity of data. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of data-based few-shot learning in medical imaging by exploring different data attribute representations in a low-dimensional space. We introduce different types of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in few-shot learning, addressing the data scarcity issue in medical image classification. Extensive empirical studies are conducted in terms of validating the effectiveness of NMF, especially its supervised variants (e.g., discriminative NMF, and supervised and constrained NMF with sparseness), and the comparison with principal component analysis (PCA), i.e., the collaborative representation-based dimensionality reduction technique derived from eigenvectors. With 14 different datasets covering 11 distinct illness categories, thorough experimental results and comparison with related techniques demonstrate that NMF is a competitive alternative to PCA for few-shot learning in medical imaging, and the supervised NMF algorithms are more discriminative in the subspace with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, we show that the part-based representation of NMF, especially its supervised variants, is dramatically impactful in detecting lesion areas in medical imaging with limited samples.</description>

      <title>A Satellite Band Selection Framework for Amazon Forest Deforestation Detection Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conservation of tropical forests is a topic of significant social and ecological relevance due to their crucial role in the global ecosystem. Unfortunately, deforestation and degradation impact millions of hectares annually, necessitating government or private initiatives for effective forest monitoring. This study introduces a novel framework that employs the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA) to select spectral bands from Landsat-8 satellite, optimizing the representation of deforested areas. This selection guides a semantic segmentation architecture, DeepLabv3+, enhancing its performance. Experimental results revealed several band compositions that achieved superior balanced accuracy compared to commonly adopted combinations for deforestation detection, utilizing segment classification via a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Moreover, the optimal band compositions identified by the UMDA-based approach improved the performance of the DeepLabv3+ architecture, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches compared in this study. The observation that a few selected bands outperform the total contradicts the data-driven paradigm prevalent in the deep learning field. Therefore, this suggests an exception to the conventional wisdom that 'more is always better'.</description>

      <title>RS-Mamba for Large Remote Sensing Image Dense Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial resolution of remote sensing images is becoming increasingly higher, posing challenges in handling large very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images for dense prediction tasks. Models based on convolutional neural networks are limited in their ability to model global features of remote sensing images due to local convolution operations. Transformer based models, despite their global modeling capabilities, face computational challenges with large VHR images due to their quadratic complexity. The common practice of cropping large images into smaller patches leads to a significant loss of contextual information. To address these issues, we propose the Remote Sensing Mamba (RSM) for dense prediction tasks in VHR remote sensing. RSM is designed to model global features of remote sensing images with linear complexity, enabling it to process large VHR images effectively. It employs an omnidirectional selective scan module to globally model the images in multiple directions, capturing large spatial features from various directions. Experiments on semantic segmentation and change detection tasks across various objects demonstrate the effectiveness of RSM. With simple model architecture and training approach, RSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the dense prediction tasks of VHR remote sensing. The code for this work will be available at https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_Remote_Sensing_Mamba.</description>

      <title>Independently Keypoint Learning for Small Object Semantic Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic correspondence remains a challenging task for establishing correspondences between a pair of images with the same category or similar scenes due to the large intra-class appearance. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem called 'Small Object Semantic Correspondence (SOSC).' This problem is challenging due to the close proximity of keypoints associated with small objects, which results in the fusion of these respective features. It is difficult to identify the corresponding key points of the fused features, and it is also difficult to be recognized. To address this challenge, we propose the Keypoint Bounding box-centered Cropping (KBC) method, which aims to increase the spatial separation between keypoints of small objects, thereby facilitating independent learning of these keypoints. The KBC method is seamlessly integrated into our proposed inference pipeline and can be easily incorporated into other methodologies, resulting in significant performance enhancements. Additionally, we introduce a novel framework, named KBCNet, which serves as our baseline model. KBCNet comprises a Cross-Scale Feature Alignment (CSFA) module and an efficient 4D convolutional decoder. The CSFA module is designed to align multi-scale features, enriching keypoint representations by integrating fine-grained features and deep semantic features. Meanwhile, the 4D convolutional decoder, based on efficient 4D convolution, ensures efficiency and rapid convergence. To empirically validate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology, extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used benchmarks: PF-PASCAL, PF-WILLOW, and SPair-71k. Our KBC method demonstrates a substantial performance improvement of 7.5\% on the SPair-71K dataset, providing compelling evidence of its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Design2Cloth: 3D Cloth Generation from 2D Masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the field of digital avatar research, towards modeling, animating and reconstructing clothed human representations, as a key step towards creating realistic avatars. However, current 3D cloth generation methods are garment specific or trained completely on synthetic data, hence lacking fine details and realism. In this work, we make a step towards automatic realistic garment design and propose Design2Cloth, a high fidelity 3D generative model trained on a real world dataset from more than 2000 subject scans. To provide vital contribution to the fashion industry, we developed a user-friendly adversarial model capable of generating diverse and detailed clothes simply by drawing a 2D cloth mask. Under a series of both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we showcase that Design2Cloth outperforms current state-of-the-art cloth generative models by a large margin. In addition to the generative properties of our network, we showcase that the proposed method can be used to achieve high quality reconstructions from single in-the-wild images and 3D scans. Dataset, code and pre-trained model will become publicly available.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic Origin Attribution of Generated Images with Few-shot Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in visual generative models enables the generation of high-quality images. To prevent the misuse of generated images, it is important to identify the origin model that generates them. In this work, we study the origin attribution of generated images in a practical setting where only a few images generated by a source model are available and the source model cannot be accessed. The goal is to check if a given image is generated by the source model. We first formulate this problem as a few-shot one-class classification task. To solve the task, we propose OCC-CLIP, a CLIP-based framework for few-shot one-class classification, enabling the identification of an image's source model, even among multiple candidates. Extensive experiments corresponding to various generative models verify the effectiveness of our OCC-CLIP framework. Furthermore, an experiment based on the recently released DALL-E 3 API verifies the real-world applicability of our solution.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Power of Large Vision Language Models for Synthetic Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of models capable of generating images from text has attracted considerable interest, offering the possibility of creating realistic images from text descriptions. Yet these advances have also raised concerns about the potential misuse of these images, including the creation of misleading content such as fake news and propaganda. This study investigates the effectiveness of using advanced vision-language models (VLMs) for synthetic image identification. Specifically, the focus is on tuning state-of-the-art image captioning models for synthetic image detection. By harnessing the robust understanding capabilities of large VLMs, the aim is to distinguish authentic images from synthetic images produced by diffusion-based models. This study contributes to the advancement of synthetic image detection by exploiting the capabilities of visual language models such as BLIP-2 and ViTGPT2. By tailoring image captioning models, we address the challenges associated with the potential misuse of synthetic images in real-world applications. Results described in this paper highlight the promising role of VLMs in the field of synthetic image detection, outperforming conventional image-based detection techniques.

      <title>InstantStyle: Free Lunch towards Style-Preserving in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning-free diffusion-based models have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of image personalization and customization. However, despite this notable progress, current models continue to grapple with several complex challenges in producing style-consistent image generation. Firstly, the concept of style is inherently underdetermined, encompassing a multitude of elements such as color, material, atmosphere, design, and structure, among others. Secondly, inversion-based methods are prone to style degradation, often resulting in the loss of fine-grained details. Lastly, adapter-based approaches frequently require meticulous weight tuning for each reference image to achieve a balance between style intensity and text controllability. In this paper, we commence by examining several compelling yet frequently overlooked observations. We then proceed to introduce InstantStyle, a framework designed to address these issues through the implementation of two key strategies: 1) A straightforward mechanism that decouples style and content from reference images within the feature space, predicated on the assumption that features within the same space can be either added to or subtracted from one another. 2) The injection of reference image features exclusively into style-specific blocks, thereby preventing style leaks and eschewing the need for cumbersome weight tuning, which often characterizes more parameter-heavy designs.Our work demonstrates superior visual stylization outcomes, striking an optimal balance between the intensity of style and the controllability of textual elements. Our codes will be available at https://github.com/InstantStyle/InstantStyle.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Affinity-Based Generalization For MRI Imaging Segmentation Across Resource-Limited Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint utilization of diverse data sources for medical imaging segmentation has emerged as a crucial area of research, aiming to address challenges such as data heterogeneity, domain shift, and data quality discrepancies. Integrating information from multiple data domains has shown promise in improving model generalizability and adaptability. However, this approach often demands substantial computational resources, hindering its practicality. In response, knowledge distillation (KD) has garnered attention as a solution. KD involves training light-weight models to emulate the behavior of more resource-intensive models, thereby mitigating the computational burden while maintaining performance. This paper addresses the pressing need to develop a lightweight and generalizable model for medical imaging segmentation that can effectively handle data integration challenges. Our proposed approach introduces a novel relation-based knowledge framework by seamlessly combining adaptive affinity-based and kernel-based distillation through a gram matrix that can capture the style representation across features. This methodology empowers the student model to accurately replicate the feature representations of the teacher model, facilitating robust performance even in the face of domain shift and data heterogeneity. To validate our innovative approach, we conducted experiments on publicly available multi-source prostate MRI data. The results demonstrate a significant enhancement in segmentation performance using lightweight networks. Notably, our method achieves this improvement while reducing both inference time and storage usage, rendering it a practical and efficient solution for real-time medical imaging segmentation.</description>

      <title>LiDAR4D: Dynamic Neural Fields for Novel Space-time View LiDAR Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved triumphs in image novel view synthesis (NVS), LiDAR NVS remains largely unexplored. Previous LiDAR NVS methods employ a simple shift from image NVS methods while ignoring the dynamic nature and the large-scale reconstruction problem of LiDAR point clouds. In light of this, we propose LiDAR4D, a differentiable LiDAR-only framework for novel space-time LiDAR view synthesis. In consideration of the sparsity and large-scale characteristics, we design a 4D hybrid representation combined with multi-planar and grid features to achieve effective reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, we introduce geometric constraints derived from point clouds to improve temporal consistency. For the realistic synthesis of LiDAR point clouds, we incorporate the global optimization of ray-drop probability to preserve cross-region patterns. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and NuScenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in accomplishing geometry-aware and time-consistent dynamic reconstruction. Codes are available at https://github.com/ispc-lab/LiDAR4D.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention Makes Inference Cumbersome in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the role of cross-attention during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. We find that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after few inference steps. Accordingly, the time point of convergence naturally divides the entire inference process into two stages: an initial semantics-planning stage, during which, the model relies on cross-attention to plan text-oriented visual semantics, and a subsequent fidelity-improving stage, during which the model tries to generate images from previously planned semantics. Surprisingly, ignoring text conditions in the fidelity-improving stage not only reduces computation complexity, but also maintains model performance. This yields a simple and training-free method called TGATE for efficient generation, which caches the cross-attention output once it converges and keeps it fixed during the remaining inference steps. Our empirical study on the MS-COCO validation set confirms its effectiveness. The source code of TGATE is available at https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/T-GATE.</description>

      <title>DIBS: Enhancing Dense Video Captioning with Unlabeled Videos via Pseudo Boundary Enrichment and Online Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Dive Into the BoundarieS (DIBS), a novel pretraining framework for dense video captioning (DVC), that elaborates on improving the quality of the generated event captions and their associated pseudo event boundaries from unlabeled videos. By leveraging the capabilities of diverse large language models (LLMs), we generate rich DVC-oriented caption candidates and optimize the corresponding pseudo boundaries under several meticulously designed objectives, considering diversity, event-centricity, temporal ordering, and coherence. Moreover, we further introduce a novel online boundary refinement strategy that iteratively improves the quality of pseudo boundaries during training. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed technique components. By leveraging a substantial amount of unlabeled video data, such as HowTo100M, we achieve a remarkable advancement on standard DVC datasets like YouCook2 and ActivityNet. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art Vid2Seq across a majority of metrics, achieving this with just 0.4% of the unlabeled video data used for pre-training by Vid2Seq.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Occupancy Learning from Sparse Point Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations have gained prominence as a powerful framework for capturing complex data modalities, encompassing a wide range from 3D shapes to images and audio. Within the realm of 3D shape representation, Neural Signed Distance Functions (SDF) have demonstrated remarkable potential in faithfully encoding intricate shape geometry. However, learning SDFs from 3D point clouds in the absence of ground truth supervision remains a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method to infer occupancy fields instead of SDFs as they are easier to learn from sparse inputs. We leverage a margin-based uncertainty measure to differentially sample from the decision boundary of the occupancy function and supervise the sampled boundary points using the input point cloud. We further stabilize the optimization process at the early stages of the training by biasing the occupancy function towards minimal entropy fields while maximizing its entropy at the input point cloud. Through extensive experiments and evaluations, we illustrate the efficacy of our proposed method, highlighting its capacity to improve implicit shape inference with respect to baselines and the state-of-the-art using synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>GenN2N: Generative NeRF2NeRF Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GenN2N, a unified NeRF-to-NeRF translation framework for various NeRF translation tasks such as text-driven NeRF editing, colorization, super-resolution, inpainting, etc. Unlike previous methods designed for individual translation tasks with task-specific schemes, GenN2N achieves all these NeRF editing tasks by employing a plug-and-play image-to-image translator to perform editing in the 2D domain and lifting 2D edits into the 3D NeRF space. Since the 3D consistency of 2D edits may not be assured, we propose to model the distribution of the underlying 3D edits through a generative model that can cover all possible edited NeRFs. To model the distribution of 3D edited NeRFs from 2D edited images, we carefully design a VAE-GAN that encodes images while decoding NeRFs. The latent space is trained to align with a Gaussian distribution and the NeRFs are supervised through an adversarial loss on its renderings. To ensure the latent code does not depend on 2D viewpoints but truly reflects the 3D edits, we also regularize the latent code through a contrastive learning scheme. Extensive experiments on various editing tasks show GenN2N, as a universal framework, performs as well or better than task-specific specialists while possessing flexible generative power.

      <title>MULAN: A Multi Layer Annotated Dataset for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation has achieved astonishing results, yet precise spatial controllability and prompt fidelity remain highly challenging. This limitation is typically addressed through cumbersome prompt engineering, scene layout conditioning, or image editing techniques which often require hand drawn masks. Nonetheless, pre-existing works struggle to take advantage of the natural instance-level compositionality of scenes due to the typically flat nature of rasterized RGB output images. Towards adressing this challenge, we introduce MuLAn: a novel dataset comprising over 44K MUlti-Layer ANnotations of RGB images as multilayer, instance-wise RGBA decompositions, and over 100K instance images. To build MuLAn, we developed a training free pipeline which decomposes a monocular RGB image into a stack of RGBA layers comprising of background and isolated instances. We achieve this through the use of pretrained general-purpose models, and by developing three modules: image decomposition for instance discovery and extraction, instance completion to reconstruct occluded areas, and image re-assembly. We use our pipeline to create MuLAn-COCO and MuLAn-LAION datasets, which contain a variety of image decompositions in terms of style, composition and complexity. With MuLAn, we provide the first photorealistic resource providing instance decomposition and occlusion information for high quality images, opening up new avenues for text-to-image generative AI research. With this, we aim to encourage the development of novel generation and editing technology, in particular layer-wise solutions. MuLAn data resources are available at https://MuLAn-dataset.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Interpretability of Vertebrae Fracture Grading using Human-interpretable Prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertebral fracture grading classifies the severity of vertebral fractures, which is a challenging task in medical imaging and has recently attracted Deep Learning (DL) models. Only a few works attempted to make such models human-interpretable despite the need for transparency and trustworthiness in critical use cases like DL-assisted medical diagnosis. Moreover, such models either rely on post-hoc methods or additional annotations. In this work, we propose a novel interpretable-by-design method, ProtoVerse, to find relevant sub-parts of vertebral fractures (prototypes) that reliably explain the model's decision in a human-understandable way. Specifically, we introduce a novel diversity-promoting loss to mitigate prototype repetitions in small datasets with intricate semantics. We have experimented with the VerSe'19 dataset and outperformed the existing prototype-based method. Further, our model provides superior interpretability against the post-hoc method. Importantly, expert radiologists validated the visual interpretability of our results, showing clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Conditioned Reconstruction for Language-guided Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments underscore the potential of textual information in enhancing learning models for a deeper understanding of medical visual semantics. However, language-guided medical image segmentation still faces a challenging issue. Previous works employ implicit and ambiguous architectures to embed textual information. This leads to segmentation results that are inconsistent with the semantics represented by the language, sometimes even diverging significantly. To this end, we propose a novel cross-modal conditioned Reconstruction for Language-guided Medical Image Segmentation (RecLMIS) to explicitly capture cross-modal interactions, which assumes that well-aligned medical visual features and medical notes can effectively reconstruct each other. We introduce conditioned interaction to adaptively predict patches and words of interest. Subsequently, they are utilized as conditioning factors for mutual reconstruction to align with regions described in the medical notes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RecLMIS, surpassing LViT by 3.74% mIoU on the publicly available MosMedData+ dataset and achieving an average increase of 1.89% mIoU for cross-domain tests on our QATA-CoV19 dataset. Simultaneously, we achieve a relative reduction of 20.2% in parameter count and a 55.5% decrease in computational load. The code will be available at https://github.com/ShashankHuang/RecLMIS.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection in remotely sensed satellite pictures is fundamental in many fields such as biophysical, and environmental monitoring. While deep learning algorithms are constantly evolving, they have been mostly implemented and tested on popular ground-based taken photos. This paper critically evaluates and compares a suite of advanced object detection algorithms customized for the task of identifying aircraft within satellite imagery. Using the large HRPlanesV2 dataset, together with a rigorous validation with the GDIT dataset, this research encompasses an array of methodologies including YOLO versions 5 and 8, Faster RCNN, CenterNet, RetinaNet, RTMDet, and DETR, all trained from scratch. This exhaustive training and validation study reveal YOLOv5 as the preeminent model for the specific case of identifying airplanes from remote sensing data, showcasing high precision and adaptability across diverse imaging conditions. This research highlight the nuanced performance landscapes of these algorithms, with YOLOv5 emerging as a robust solution for aerial object detection, underlining its importance through superior mean average precision, Recall, and Intersection over Union scores. The findings described here underscore the fundamental role of algorithm selection aligned with the specific demands of satellite imagery analysis and extend a comprehensive framework to evaluate model efficacy. The benchmark toolkit and codes, available via https://github.com/toelt-llc/FlightScope_Bench, aims to further exploration and innovation in the realm of remote sensing object detection, paving the way for improved analytical methodologies in satellite imagery applications.</description>

      <title>On the Scalability of Diffusion-based Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling up model and data size has been quite successful for the evolution of LLMs. However, the scaling law for the diffusion based text-to-image (T2I) models is not fully explored. It is also unclear how to efficiently scale the model for better performance at reduced cost. The different training settings and expensive training cost make a fair model comparison extremely difficult. In this work, we empirically study the scaling properties of diffusion based T2I models by performing extensive and rigours ablations on scaling both denoising backbones and training set, including training scaled UNet and Transformer variants ranging from 0.4B to 4B parameters on datasets upto 600M images. For model scaling, we find the location and amount of cross attention distinguishes the performance of existing UNet designs. And increasing the transformer blocks is more parameter-efficient for improving text-image alignment than increasing channel numbers. We then identify an efficient UNet variant, which is 45% smaller and 28% faster than SDXL's UNet. On the data scaling side, we show the quality and diversity of the training set matters more than simply dataset size. Increasing caption density and diversity improves text-image alignment performance and the learning efficiency. Finally, we provide scaling functions to predict the text-image alignment performance as functions of the scale of model size, compute and dataset size.</description>

      <title>PoCo: Point Context Cluster for RGBD Indoor Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel end-to-end algorithm (PoCo) for the indoor RGB-D place recognition task, aimed at identifying the most likely match for a given query frame within a reference database. The task presents inherent challenges attributed to the constrained field of view and limited range of perception sensors. We propose a new network architecture, which generalizes the recent Context of Clusters (CoCs) to extract global descriptors directly from the noisy point clouds through end-to-end learning. Moreover, we develop the architecture by integrating both color and geometric modalities into the point features to enhance the global descriptor representation. We conducted evaluations on public datasets ScanNet-PR and ARKit with 807 and 5047 scenarios, respectively. PoCo achieves SOTA performance: on ScanNet-PR, we achieve R@1 of 64.63%, a 5.7% improvement from the best-published result CGis (61.12%); on Arkit, we achieve R@1 of 45.12%, a 13.3% improvement from the best-published result CGis (39.82%). In addition, PoCo shows higher efficiency than CGis in inference time (1.75X-faster), and we demonstrate the effectiveness of PoCo in recognizing places within a real-world laboratory environment.</description>

      <title>Deep Image Composition Meets Image Forgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image forgery is a topic that has been studied for many years. Before the breakthrough of deep learning, forged images were detected using handcrafted features that did not require training. These traditional methods failed to perform satisfactorily even on datasets much worse in quality than real-life image manipulations. Advances in deep learning have impacted image forgery detection as much as they have impacted other areas of computer vision and have improved the state of the art. Deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data for training. In the case of image forgery, labeled data at the pixel level is a very important factor for the models to learn. None of the existing datasets have sufficient size, realism and pixel-level labeling at the same time. This is due to the high cost of producing and labeling quality images. It can take hours for an image editing expert to manipulate just one image. To bridge this gap, we automate data generation using image composition techniques that are very related to image forgery. Unlike other automated data generation frameworks, we use state of the art image composition deep learning models to generate spliced images close to the quality of real-life manipulations. Finally, we test the generated dataset on the SOTA image manipulation detection model and show that its prediction performance is lower compared to existing datasets, i.e. we produce realistic images that are more difficult to detect.

      <title>MatAtlas: Text-driven Consistent Geometry Texturing and Material Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MatAtlas, a method for consistent text-guided 3D model texturing. Following recent progress we leverage a large scale text-to-image generation model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) as a prior to texture a 3D model. We carefully design an RGB texturing pipeline that leverages a grid pattern diffusion, driven by depth and edges. By proposing a multi-step texture refinement process, we significantly improve the quality and 3D consistency of the texturing output. To further address the problem of baked-in lighting, we move beyond RGB colors and pursue assigning parametric materials to the assets. Given the high-quality initial RGB texture, we propose a novel material retrieval method capitalized on Large Language Models (LLM), enabling editabiliy and relightability. We evaluate our method on a wide variety of geometries and show that our method significantly outperform prior arts. We also analyze the role of each component through a detailed ablation study.</description>

      <title>DeiT-LT Distillation Strikes Back for Vision Transformer Training on Long-Tailed Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a prominent architecture for various computer vision tasks. In ViT, we divide the input image into patch tokens and process them through a stack of self attention blocks. However, unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ViTs simple architecture has no informative inductive bias (e.g., locality,etc. ). Due to this, ViT requires a large amount of data for pre-training. Various data efficient approaches (DeiT) have been proposed to train ViT on balanced datasets effectively. However, limited literature discusses the use of ViT for datasets with long-tailed imbalances. In this work, we introduce DeiT-LT to tackle the problem of training ViTs from scratch on long-tailed datasets. In DeiT-LT, we introduce an efficient and effective way of distillation from CNN via distillation DIST token by using out-of-distribution images and re-weighting the distillation loss to enhance focus on tail classes. This leads to the learning of local CNN-like features in early ViT blocks, improving generalization for tail classes. Further, to mitigate overfitting, we propose distilling from a flat CNN teacher, which leads to learning low-rank generalizable features for DIST tokens across all ViT blocks. With the proposed DeiT-LT scheme, the distillation DIST token becomes an expert on the tail classes, and the classifier CLS token becomes an expert on the head classes. The experts help to effectively learn features corresponding to both the majority and minority classes using a distinct set of tokens within the same ViT architecture. We show the effectiveness of DeiT-LT for training ViT from scratch on datasets ranging from small-scale CIFAR-10 LT to large-scale iNaturalist-2018.</description>

      <title>LidarDM: Generative LiDAR Simulation in a Generated World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LidarDM, a novel LiDAR generative model capable of producing realistic, layout-aware, physically plausible, and temporally coherent LiDAR videos. LidarDM stands out with two unprecedented capabilities in LiDAR generative modeling: (i) LiDAR generation guided by driving scenarios, offering significant potential for autonomous driving simulations, and (ii) 4D LiDAR point cloud generation, enabling the creation of realistic and temporally coherent sequences. At the heart of our model is a novel integrated 4D world generation framework. Specifically, we employ latent diffusion models to generate the 3D scene, combine it with dynamic actors to form the underlying 4D world, and subsequently produce realistic sensory observations within this virtual environment. Our experiments indicate that our approach outperforms competing algorithms in realism, temporal coherency, and layout consistency. We additionally show that LidarDM can be used as a generative world model simulator for training and testing perception models.</description>

      <title>ALOHa: A New Measure for Hallucination in Captioning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in multimodal pre-training for visual description, state-of-the-art models still produce captions containing errors, such as hallucinating objects not present in a scene. The existing prominent metric for object hallucination, CHAIR, is limited to a fixed set of MS COCO objects and synonyms. In this work, we propose a modernized open-vocabulary metric, ALOHa, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to measure object hallucinations. Specifically, we use an LLM to extract groundable objects from a candidate caption, measure their semantic similarity to reference objects from captions and object detections, and use Hungarian matching to produce a final hallucination score. We show that ALOHa correctly identifies 13.6% more hallucinated objects than CHAIR on HAT, a new gold-standard subset of MS COCO Captions annotated for hallucinations, and 30.8% more on nocaps, where objects extend beyond MS COCO categories. Our code is available at https://davidmchan.github.io/aloha/.</description>

      <title>Visual Autoregressive Modeling: Scalable Image Generation via Next-Scale Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR), a new generation paradigm that redefines the autoregressive learning on images as coarse-to-fine "next-scale prediction" or "next-resolution prediction", diverging from the standard raster-scan "next-token prediction". This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and generalize well: VAR, for the first time, makes AR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation. On ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VAR significantly improve AR baseline by improving Frechet inception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.80, inception score (IS) from 80.4 to 356.4, with around 20x faster inference speed. It is also empirically verified that VAR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in multiple dimensions including image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability. Scaling up VAR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to those observed in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near -0.998 as solid evidence. VAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstream tasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. These results suggest VAR has initially emulated the two important properties of LLMs: Scaling Laws and zero-shot task generalization. We have released all models and codes to promote the exploration of AR/VAR models for visual generation and unified learning.</description>

      <title>Insights from the Use of Previously Unseen Neural Architecture Search Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boundless possibility of neural networks which can be used to solve a problem -- each with different performance -- leads to a situation where a Deep Learning expert is required to identify the best neural network. This goes against the hope of removing the need for experts. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) offers a solution to this by automatically identifying the best architecture. However, to date, NAS work has focused on a small set of datasets which we argue are not representative of real-world problems. We introduce eight new datasets created for a series of NAS Challenges: AddNIST, Language, MultNIST, CIFARTile, Gutenberg, Isabella, GeoClassing, and Chesseract. These datasets and challenges are developed to direct attention to issues in NAS development and to encourage authors to consider how their models will perform on datasets unknown to them at development time. We present experimentation using standard Deep Learning methods as well as the best results from challenge participants.</description>

      <title>Effective Malware Detection for Embedded Computing Systems with Limited Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the pivotal security threats for the embedded computing systems is malicious software a.k.a malware. With efficiency and efficacy, Machine Learning (ML) has been widely adopted for malware detection in recent times. Despite being efficient, the existing techniques require a tremendous number of benign and malware samples for training and modeling an efficient malware detector. Furthermore, such constraints limit the detection of emerging malware samples due to the lack of sufficient malware samples required for efficient training. To address such concerns, we introduce a code-aware data generation technique that generates multiple mutated samples of the limitedly seen malware by the devices. Loss minimization ensures that the generated samples closely mimic the limitedly seen malware and mitigate the impractical samples. Such developed malware is further incorporated into the training set to formulate the model that can efficiently detect the emerging malware despite having limited exposure. The experimental results demonstrates that the proposed technique achieves an accuracy of 90% in detecting limitedly seen malware, which is approximately 3x more than the accuracy attained by state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>COVID-19 Detection Based on Blood Test Parameters using Various Artificial Intelligence Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2019, the world faced a new challenge: a COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The virus rapidly spread across the globe, leading to a high rate of mortality, which prompted health organizations to take measures to control its transmission. Early disease detection is crucial in the treatment process, and computer-based automatic detection systems have been developed to aid in this effort. These systems often rely on artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as machine learning, neural networks, fuzzy systems, and deep learning to classify diseases. This study aimed to differentiate COVID-19 patients from others using self-categorizing classifiers and employing various AI methods. This study used two datasets: the blood test samples and radiography images. The best results for the blood test samples obtained from San Raphael Hospital, which include two classes of individuals, those with COVID-19 and those with non-COVID diseases, were achieved through the use of the Ensemble method (a combination of a neural network and two machines learning methods). The results showed that this approach for COVID-19 diagnosis is cost-effective and provides results in a shorter amount of time than other methods. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 94.09% on the dataset used. Secondly, the radiographic images were divided into four classes: normal, viral pneumonia, ground glass opacity, and COVID-19 infection. These were used for segmentation and classification. The lung lobes were extracted from the images and then categorized into specific classes. We achieved an accuracy of 91.1% on the image dataset. Generally, this study highlights the potential of AI in detecting and managing COVID-19 and underscores the importance of continued research and development in this field.</description>

      <title>Cohort-Individual Cooperative Learning for Multimodal Cancer Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed impressive achievements in cancer survival analysis by integrating multimodal data, e.g., pathology images and genomic profiles. However, the heterogeneity and high dimensionality of these modalities pose significant challenges for extracting discriminative representations while maintaining good generalization. In this paper, we propose a Cohort-individual Cooperative Learning (CCL) framework to advance cancer survival analysis by collaborating knowledge decomposition and cohort guidance. Specifically, first, we propose a Multimodal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) module to explicitly decompose multimodal knowledge into four distinct components: redundancy, synergy and uniqueness of the two modalities. Such a comprehensive decomposition can enlighten the models to perceive easily overlooked yet important information, facilitating an effective multimodal fusion. Second, we propose a Cohort Guidance Modeling (CGM) to mitigate the risk of overfitting task-irrelevant information. It can promote a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the underlying multimodal data, while avoiding the pitfalls of overfitting and enhancing the generalization ability of the model. By cooperating the knowledge decomposition and cohort guidance methods, we develop a robust multimodal survival analysis model with enhanced discrimination and generalization abilities. Extensive experimental results on five cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in integrating multimodal data for survival analysis.</description>

      <title>RESSA: Repair Sparse Vision-Language Models via Sparse Cross-Modality Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), integrating diverse information from multiple modalities, have shown remarkable success across various tasks. However, deploying VLMs, comprising large-scale vision and language models poses challenges in resource-constrained scenarios. While pruning followed by finetuning offers a potential solution to maintain performance with smaller model sizes, its application to VLMs remains relatively unexplored, presenting two main questions: how to distribute sparsity across different modality-specific models, and how to repair the performance of pruned sparse VLMs. To answer the first question, we conducted preliminary studies on VLM pruning and found that pruning vision models and language models with the same sparsity ratios contribute to nearly optimal performance. For the second question, unlike finetuning unimodal sparse models, sparse VLMs involve cross-modality interactions, requiring specialized techniques for post-pruning performance repair. Moreover, while parameter-efficient LoRA finetuning has been proposed to repair the performance of sparse models, a significant challenge of weights merging arises due to the incompatibility of dense LoRA modules with sparse models that destroy the sparsity of pruned models. To tackle these challenges, we propose to Repair Sparse Vision-Language Models via Sparse Cross-modality Adaptation (RESSA). RESSA utilizes cross-modality finetuning to enhance task-specific performance and facilitate knowledge distillation from original dense models. Additionally, we introduce SparseLoRA, which applies sparsity directly to LoRA weights, enabling seamless integration with sparse models. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of RESSA, showcasing significant enhancements, such as an 11.3\% improvement under 2:4 sparsity and a remarkable 47.6\% enhancement under unstructured 70\% sparsity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the CPAISD: Core-Penumbra Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset, aimed at enhancing the early detection and segmentation of ischemic stroke using Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) scans. Addressing the challenges in diagnosing acute ischemic stroke during its early stages due to often non-revealing native CT findings, the dataset provides a collection of segmented NCCT images. These include annotations of ischemic core and penumbra regions, critical for developing machine learning models for rapid stroke identification and assessment. By offering a carefully collected and annotated dataset, we aim to facilitate the development of advanced diagnostic tools, contributing to improved patient care and outcomes in stroke management. Our dataset's uniqueness lies in its focus on the acute phase of ischemic stroke, with non-informative native CT scans, and includes a baseline model to demonstrate the dataset's application, encouraging further research and innovation in the field of medical imaging and stroke diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Vestibular schwannoma growth_prediction from longitudinal MRI by time conditioned neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are benign tumors that are generally managed by active surveillance with MRI examination. To further assist clinical decision-making and avoid overtreatment, an accurate prediction of tumor growth based on longitudinal imaging is highly desirable. In this paper, we introduce DeepGrowth, a deep learning method that incorporates neural fields and recurrent neural networks for prospective tumor growth prediction. In the proposed method, each tumor is represented as a signed distance function (SDF) conditioned on a low-dimensional latent code. Unlike previous studies that perform tumor shape prediction directly in the image space, we predict the latent codes instead and then reconstruct future shapes from it. To deal with irregular time intervals, we introduce a time-conditioned recurrent module based on a ConvLSTM and a novel temporal encoding strategy, which enables the proposed model to output varying tumor shapes over time. The experiments on an in-house longitudinal VS dataset showed that the proposed model significantly improved the performance ($\ge 1.6\%$ Dice score and $\ge0.20$ mm 95\% Hausdorff distance), in particular for top 20\% tumors that grow or shrink the most ($\ge 4.6\%$ Dice score and $\ge 0.73$ mm 95\% Hausdorff distance).

      <title>Event Camera Demosaicing via Swin Transformer and Pixel-focus Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has highlighted improvements in high-quality imaging guided by event cameras, with most of these efforts concentrating on the RGB domain. However, these advancements frequently neglect the unique challenges introduced by the inherent flaws in the sensor design of event cameras in the RAW domain. Specifically, this sensor design results in the partial loss of pixel values, posing new challenges for RAW domain processes like demosaicing. The challenge intensifies as most research in the RAW domain is based on the premise that each pixel contains a value, making the straightforward adaptation of these methods to event camera demosaicing problematic. To end this, we present a Swin-Transformer-based backbone and a pixel-focus loss function for demosaicing with missing pixel values in RAW domain processing. Our core motivation is to refine a general and widely applicable foundational model from the RGB domain for RAW domain processing, thereby broadening the model's applicability within the entire imaging process. Our method harnesses multi-scale processing and space-to-depth techniques to ensure efficiency and reduce computing complexity. We also proposed the Pixel-focus Loss function for network fine-tuning to improve network convergence based on our discovery of a long-tailed distribution in training loss. Our method has undergone validation on the MIPI Demosaic Challenge dataset, with subsequent analytical experimentation confirming its efficacy. All code and trained models are released here: https://github.com/yunfanLu/ev-demosaic</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization through Meta-Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence but often lack performance when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, a common scenario due to the inevitable domain shifts in real-world applications. This limitation stems from the common assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution-an assumption frequently violated in practice. Despite their effectiveness with large amounts of data and computational power, DNNs struggle with distributional shifts and limited labeled data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization across various tasks and domains. Meta-learning presents a promising approach by employing algorithms that acquire transferable knowledge across various tasks for fast adaptation, eliminating the need to learn each task from scratch. This survey paper delves into the realm of meta-learning with a focus on its contribution to domain generalization. We first clarify the concept of meta-learning for domain generalization and introduce a novel taxonomy based on the feature extraction strategy and the classifier learning methodology, offering a granular view of methodologies. Through an exhaustive review of existing methods and underlying theories, we map out the fundamentals of the field. Our survey provides practical insights and an informed discussion on promising research directions, paving the way for future innovation in meta-learning for domain generalization.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated RSF Level Set Evolution for Large-Scale Microvascular Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microvascular networks are challenging to model because these structures are currently near the diffraction limit for most advanced three-dimensional imaging modalities, including confocal and light sheet microscopy. This makes semantic segmentation difficult, because individual components of these networks fluctuate within the confines of individual pixels. Level set methods are ideally suited to solve this problem by providing surface and topological constraints on the resulting model, however these active contour techniques are extremely time intensive and impractical for terabyte-scale images. We propose a reformulation and implementation of the region-scalable fitting (RSF) level set model that makes it amenable to three-dimensional evaluation using both single-instruction multiple data (SIMD) and single-program multiple-data (SPMD) parallel processing. This enables evaluation of the level set equation on independent regions of the data set using graphics processing units (GPUs), making large-scale segmentation of high-resolution networks practical and inexpensive.
  We tested this 3D parallel RSF approach on multiple data sets acquired using state-of-the-art imaging techniques to acquire microvascular data, including micro-CT, light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) and milling microscopy. To assess the performance and accuracy of the RSF model, we conducted a Monte-Carlo-based validation technique to compare results to other segmentation methods. We also provide a rigorous profiling to show the gains in processing speed leveraging parallel hardware. This study showcases the practical application of the RSF model, emphasizing its utility in the challenging domain of segmenting large-scale high-topology network structures with a particular focus on building microvascular models.</description>

      <title>Steganographic Passport: An Owner and User Verifiable Credential for Deep Model IP Protection Without Retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the legal usage of deep models is crucial to promoting trustable, accountable, and responsible artificial intelligence innovation. Current passport-based methods that obfuscate model functionality for license-to-use and ownership verifications suffer from capacity and quality constraints, as they require retraining the owner model for new users. They are also vulnerable to advanced Expanded Residual Block ambiguity attacks. We propose Steganographic Passport, which uses an invertible steganographic network to decouple license-to-use from ownership verification by hiding the user's identity images into the owner-side passport and recovering them from their respective user-side passports. An irreversible and collision-resistant hash function is used to avoid exposing the owner-side passport from the derived user-side passports and increase the uniqueness of the model signature. To safeguard both the passport and model's weights against advanced ambiguity attacks, an activation-level obfuscation is proposed for the verification branch of the owner's model. By jointly training the verification and deployment branches, their weights become tightly coupled. The proposed method supports agile licensing of deep models by providing a strong ownership proof and license accountability without requiring a separate model retraining for the admission of every new user. Experiment results show that our Steganographic Passport outperforms other passport-based deep model protection methods in robustness against various known attacks.</description>

      <title>Isometric Multi-Shape Matching</title>

Abstract: Finding correspondences between shapes is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics, which is relevant for many applications, including 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and style transfer. The vast majority of correspondence methods aim to find a solution between pairs of shapes, even if multiple instances of the same class are available. While isometries are often studied in shape correspondence problems, they have not been considered explicitly in the multi-matching setting. This paper closes this gap by proposing a novel optimisation formulation for isometric multi-shape matching. We present a suitable optimisation algorithm for solving our formulation and provide a convergence and complexity analysis. Our algorithm obtains multi-matchings that are by construction provably cycle-consistent. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method on various datasets and set the new state-of-the-art in isometric multi-shape matching.</description>

      <title>MCUNetV2: Memory-Efficient Patch-based Inference for Tiny Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tiny deep learning on microcontroller units (MCUs) is challenging due to the limited memory size. We find that the memory bottleneck is due to the imbalanced memory distribution in convolutional neural network (CNN) designs: the first several blocks have an order of magnitude larger memory usage than the rest of the network. To alleviate this issue, we propose a generic patch-by-patch inference scheduling, which operates only on a small spatial region of the feature map and significantly cuts down the peak memory. However, naive implementation brings overlapping patches and computation overhead. We further propose network redistribution to shift the receptive field and FLOPs to the later stage and reduce the computation overhead. Manually redistributing the receptive field is difficult. We automate the process with neural architecture search to jointly optimize the neural architecture and inference scheduling, leading to MCUNetV2. Patch-based inference effectively reduces the peak memory usage of existing networks by 4-8x. Co-designed with neural networks, MCUNetV2 sets a record ImageNet accuracy on MCU (71.8%), and achieves &gt;90% accuracy on the visual wake words dataset under only 32kB SRAM. MCUNetV2 also unblocks object detection on tiny devices, achieving 16.9% higher mAP on Pascal VOC compared to the state-of-the-art result. Our study largely addressed the memory bottleneck in tinyML and paved the way for various vision applications beyond image classification.</description>

      <title>Causal Intervention for Subject-Deconfounded Facial Action Unit Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subject-invariant facial action unit (AU) recognition remains challenging for the reason that the data distribution varies among subjects. In this paper, we propose a causal inference framework for subject-invariant facial action unit recognition. To illustrate the causal effect existing in AU recognition task, we formulate the causalities among facial images, subjects, latent AU semantic relations, and estimated AU occurrence probabilities via a structural causal model. By constructing such a causal diagram, we clarify the causal effect among variables and propose a plug-in causal intervention module, CIS, to deconfound the confounder \emph{Subject} in the causal diagram. Extensive experiments conducted on two commonly used AU benchmark datasets, BP4D and DISFA, show the effectiveness of our CIS, and the model with CIS inserted, CISNet, has achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>On-Device Training Under 256KB Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15472v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-device training enables the model to adapt to new data collected from the sensors by fine-tuning a pre-trained model. Users can benefit from customized AI models without having to transfer the data to the cloud, protecting the privacy. However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT devices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system co-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of memory. On-device training faces two unique challenges: (1) the quantized graphs of neural networks are hard to optimize due to low bit-precision and the lack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource does not allow full back-propagation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose Quantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize 8-bit quantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to skip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The algorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny Training Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse updates and offload the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time. Our framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW. Our study enables IoT devices not only to perform inference but also to continuously adapt to new data for on-device lifelong learning.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO), aiming at monitoring the state of planet Earth using remote sensing data, is critical for improving our daily lives and living environment. With a growing number of satellites in orbit, an increasing number of datasets with diverse sensors and research domains are being published to facilitate the research of the remote sensing community. This paper presents a comprehensive review of more than 500 publicly published datasets, including research domains like agriculture, land use and land cover, disaster monitoring, scene understanding, vision-language models, foundation models, climate change, and weather forecasting. We systematically analyze these EO datasets from four aspects: volume, resolution distributions, research domains, and the correlation between datasets. Based on the dataset attributes, we propose to measure, rank, and select datasets to build a new benchmark for model evaluation. Furthermore, a new platform for EO, termed EarthNets, is released to achieve a fair and consistent evaluation of deep learning methods on remote sensing data. EarthNets supports standard dataset libraries and cutting-edge deep learning models to bridge the gap between the remote sensing and machine learning communities. Based on this platform, extensive deep-learning methods are evaluated on the new benchmark. The insightful results are beneficial to future research. The platform and dataset collections are publicly available at https://earthnets.github.io.</description>

      <title>Mind The Edge: Refining Depth Edges in Sparsely-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a fundamental problem in computer vision with numerous applications. Recently, LIDAR-supervised methods have achieved remarkable per-pixel depth accuracy in outdoor scenes. However, significant errors are typically found in the proximity of depth discontinuities, i.e., depth edges, which often hinder the performance of depth-dependent applications that are sensitive to such inaccuracies, e.g., novel view synthesis and augmented reality. Since direct supervision for the location of depth edges is typically unavailable in sparse LIDAR-based scenes, encouraging the MDE model to produce correct depth edges is not straightforward. To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first attempt to address the depth edges issue for LIDAR-supervised scenes. In this work we propose to learn to detect the location of depth edges from densely-supervised synthetic data, and use it to generate supervision for the depth edges in the MDE training. To quantitatively evaluate our approach, and due to the lack of depth edges GT in LIDAR-based scenes, we manually annotated subsets of the KITTI and the DDAD datasets with depth edges ground truth. We demonstrate significant gains in the accuracy of the depth edges with comparable per-pixel depth accuracy on several challenging datasets. Code and datasets are available at \url{https://github.com/liortalker/MindTheEdge}.</description>

      <title>ARS-DETR: Aspect Ratio Sensitive Oriented Object Detection with Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing oriented object detection methods commonly use metric AP$_{50}$ to measure the performance of the model. We argue that AP$_{50}$ is inherently unsuitable for oriented object detection due to its large tolerance in angle deviation. Therefore, we advocate using high-precision metric, e.g. AP$_{75}$, to measure the performance of models. In this paper, we propose an Aspect Ratio Sensitive Oriented Object Detector with Transformer, termed ARS-DETR, which exhibits a competitive performance in high-precision oriented object detection. Specifically, a new angle classification method, calling Aspect Ratio aware Circle Smooth Label (AR-CSL), is proposed to smooth the angle label in a more reasonable way and discard the hyperparameter that introduced by previous work (e.g. CSL). Then, a rotated deformable attention module is designed to rotate the sampling points with the corresponding angles and eliminate the misalignment between region features and sampling points. Moreover, a dynamic weight coefficient according to the aspect ratio is adopted to calculate the angle loss. Comprehensive experiments on several challenging datasets show that our method achieves competitive performance on the high-precision oriented object detection task.</description>

      <title>Creating Ensembles of Classifiers through UMDA for Aerial Scene Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerial scene classification, which aims to semantically label remote sensing images in a set of predefined classes (e.g., agricultural, beach, and harbor), is a very challenging task in remote sensing due to high intra-class variability and the different scales and orientations of the objects present in the dataset images. In remote sensing area, the use of CNN architectures as an alternative solution is also a reality for scene classification tasks. Generally, these CNNs are used to perform the traditional image classification task. However, another less used way to classify remote sensing image might be the one that uses deep metric learning (DML) approaches. In this sense, this work proposes to employ six DML approaches for aerial scene classification tasks, analysing their behave with four different pre-trained CNNs as well as combining them through the use of evolutionary computation algorithm (UMDA). In performed experiments, it is possible to observe than DML approaches can achieve the best classification results when compared to traditional pre-trained CNNs for three well-known remote sensing aerial scene datasets. In addition, the UMDA algorithm proved to be a promising strategy to combine DML approaches when there is diversity among them, managing to improve at least 5.6% of accuracy in the classification results using almost 50\% of the available classifiers for the construction of the final ensemble of classifiers.</description>

      <title>From Isolated Islands to Pangea: Unifying Semantic Space for Human Action Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Action understanding has attracted long-term attention. It can be formed as the mapping from the physical space to the semantic space. Typically, researchers built datasets according to idiosyncratic choices to define classes and push the envelope of benchmarks respectively. Datasets are incompatible with each other like "Isolated Islands" due to semantic gaps and various class granularities, e.g., do housework in dataset A and wash plate in dataset B. We argue that we need a more principled semantic space to concentrate the community efforts and use all datasets together to pursue generalizable action learning. To this end, we design a structured action semantic space given verb taxonomy hierarchy and covering massive actions. By aligning the classes of previous datasets to our semantic space, we gather (image/video/skeleton/MoCap) datasets into a unified database in a unified label system, i.e., bridging "isolated islands" into a "Pangea". Accordingly, we propose a novel model mapping from the physical space to semantic space to fully use Pangea. In extensive experiments, our new system shows significant superiority, especially in transfer learning. Our code and data will be made public at https://mvig-rhos.com/pangea.</description>

      <title>DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The YOLO series has become the most popular framework for real-time object detection due to its reasonable trade-off between speed and accuracy. However, we observe that the speed and accuracy of YOLOs are negatively affected by the NMS. Recently, end-to-end Transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have provided an alternative to eliminating NMS. Nevertheless, the high computational cost limits their practicality and hinders them from fully exploiting the advantage of excluding NMS. In this paper, we propose the Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR), the first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge that addresses the above dilemma. We build RT-DETR in two steps, drawing on the advanced DETR: first we focus on maintaining accuracy while improving speed, followed by maintaining speed while improving accuracy. Specifically, we design an efficient hybrid encoder to expeditiously process multi-scale features by decoupling intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion to improve speed. Then, we propose the uncertainty-minimal query selection to provide high-quality initial queries to the decoder, thereby improving accuracy. In addition, RT-DETR supports flexible speed tuning by adjusting the number of decoder layers to adapt to various scenarios without retraining. Our RT-DETR-R50 / R101 achieves 53.1% / 54.3% AP on COCO and 108 / 74 FPS on T4 GPU, outperforming previously advanced YOLOs in both speed and accuracy. We also develop scaled RT-DETRs that outperform the lighter YOLO detectors (S and M models). Furthermore, RT-DETR-R50 outperforms DINO-R50 by 2.2% AP in accuracy and about 21 times in FPS. After pre-training with Objects365, RT-DETR-R50 / R101 achieves 55.3% / 56.2% AP. The project page: https://zhao-yian.github.io/RTDETR.</description>

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of stress-related eating behaviors and their impact on overall health highlights the importance of effective and ubiquitous monitoring systems. In this paper, we present MeciFace, an innovative wearable technology designed to monitor facial expressions and eating activities in real-time on-the-edge (RTE). MeciFace aims to provide a low-power, privacy-conscious, and highly accurate tool for promoting healthy eating behaviors and stress management. We employ lightweight convolutional neural networks as backbone models for facial expression and eating monitoring scenarios. The MeciFace system ensures efficient data processing with a tiny memory footprint, ranging from 11KB to 19 KB. During RTE evaluation, the system achieves an F1-score of &lt; 86% for facial expression recognition and 94% for eating/drinking monitoring, for the RTE of unseen users (user-independent case).</description>

      <title>NEAT: Distilling 3D Wireframes from Neural Attraction Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of structured 3D reconstruction using wireframes that consist of line segments and junctions, focusing on the computation of structured boundary geometries of scenes. Instead of leveraging matching-based solutions from 2D wireframes (or line segments) for 3D wireframe reconstruction as done in prior arts, we present NEAT, a rendering-distilling formulation using neural fields to represent 3D line segments with 2D observations, and bipartite matching for perceiving and distilling of a sparse set of 3D global junctions. The proposed {NEAT} enjoys the joint optimization of the neural fields and the global junctions from scratch, using view-dependent 2D observations without precomputed cross-view feature matching. Comprehensive experiments on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets demonstrate our NEAT's superiority over state-of-the-art alternatives for 3D wireframe reconstruction. Moreover, the distilled 3D global junctions by NEAT, are a better initialization than SfM points, for the recently-emerged 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity novel view synthesis using about 20 times fewer initial 3D points.

Abstract: Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) plays an indispensable role in monitoring and improving the end-users' viewing experience in various real-world video-enabled media applications. As an experimental field, the improvements of BVQA models have been measured primarily on a few human-rated VQA datasets. Thus, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of existing VQA datasets in order to properly evaluate the current progress in BVQA. Towards this goal, we conduct a first-of-its-kind computational analysis of VQA datasets via designing minimalistic BVQA models. By minimalistic, we restrict our family of BVQA models to build only upon basic blocks: a video preprocessor (for aggressive spatiotemporal downsampling), a spatial quality analyzer, an optional temporal quality analyzer, and a quality regressor, all with the simplest possible instantiations. By comparing the quality prediction performance of different model variants on eight VQA datasets with realistic distortions, we find that nearly all datasets suffer from the easy dataset problem of varying severity, some of which even admit blind image quality assessment (BIQA) solutions. We additionally justify our claims by contrasting our model generalizability on these VQA datasets, and by ablating a dizzying set of BVQA design choices related to the basic building blocks. Our results cast doubt on the current progress in BVQA, and meanwhile shed light on good practices of constructing next-generation VQA datasets and models.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: Scale-Invariant Global Sparse Shape Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for generating precise sparse correspondences for highly non-rigid shapes. To this end, we introduce a projected Laplace-Beltrami operator (PLBO) which combines intrinsic and extrinsic geometric information to measure the deformation quality induced by predicted correspondences. We integrate the PLBO, together with an orientation-aware regulariser, into a novel MIP formulation that can be solved to global optimality for many practical problems. In contrast to previous methods, our approach is provably invariant to rigid transformations and global scaling, initialisation-free, has optimality guarantees, and scales to high resolution meshes with (empirically observed) linear time. We show state-of-the-art results for sparse non-rigid matching on several challenging 3D datasets, including data with inconsistent meshing, as well as applications in mesh-to-point-cloud matching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to generate full-body selfies from photographs originally taken at arms length. Because self-captured photos are typically taken close up, they have limited field of view and exaggerated perspective that distorts facial shapes. We instead seek to generate the photo some one else would take of you from a few feet away. Our approach takes as input four selfies of your face and body, a background image, and generates a full-body selfie in a desired target pose. We introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to combine all of this information into high-quality, well-composed photos of you with the desired pose and background.</description>

      <title>FreeMan: Towards Benchmarking 3D Human Pose Estimation under Real-World Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the 3D structure of the human body from natural scenes is a fundamental aspect of visual perception. 3D human pose estimation is a vital step in advancing fields like AIGC and human-robot interaction, serving as a crucial technique for understanding and interacting with human actions in real-world settings. However, the current datasets, often collected under single laboratory conditions using complex motion capture equipment and unvarying backgrounds, are insufficient. The absence of datasets on variable conditions is stalling the progress of this crucial task. To facilitate the development of 3D pose estimation, we present FreeMan, the first large-scale, multi-view dataset collected under the real-world conditions. FreeMan was captured by synchronizing 8 smartphones across diverse scenarios. It comprises 11M frames from 8000 sequences, viewed from different perspectives. These sequences cover 40 subjects across 10 different scenarios, each with varying lighting conditions. We have also established an semi-automated pipeline containing error detection to reduce the workload of manual check and ensure precise annotation. We provide comprehensive evaluation baselines for a range of tasks, underlining the significant challenges posed by FreeMan. Further evaluations of standard indoor/outdoor human sensing datasets reveal that FreeMan offers robust representation transferability in real and complex scenes.

      <title>UniBEV: Multi-modal 3D Object Detection with Uniform BEV Encoders for Robustness against Missing Sensor Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-sensor object detection is an active research topic in automated driving, but the robustness of such detection models against missing sensor input (modality missing), e.g., due to a sudden sensor failure, is a critical problem which remains under-studied. In this work, we propose UniBEV, an end-to-end multi-modal 3D object detection framework designed for robustness against missing modalities: UniBEV can operate on LiDAR plus camera input, but also on LiDAR-only or camera-only input without retraining. To facilitate its detector head to handle different input combinations, UniBEV aims to create well-aligned Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature maps from each available modality. Unlike prior BEV-based multi-modal detection methods, all sensor modalities follow a uniform approach to resample features from the native sensor coordinate systems to the BEV features. We furthermore investigate the robustness of various fusion strategies w.r.t. missing modalities: the commonly used feature concatenation, but also channel-wise averaging, and a generalization to weighted averaging termed Channel Normalized Weights. To validate its effectiveness, we compare UniBEV to state-of-the-art BEVFusion and MetaBEV on nuScenes over all sensor input combinations. In this setting, UniBEV achieves $52.5 \%$ mAP on average over all input combinations, significantly improving over the baselines ($43.5 \%$ mAP on average for BEVFusion, $48.7 \%$ mAP on average for MetaBEV). An ablation study shows the robustness benefits of fusing by weighted averaging over regular concatenation, and of sharing queries between the BEV encoders of each modality. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>Elastic Interaction Energy-Informed Real-Time Traffic Scene Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban segmentation and lane detection are two important tasks for traffic scene perception. Accuracy and fast inference speed of visual perception are crucial for autonomous driving safety. Fine and complex geometric objects are the most challenging but important recognition targets in traffic scene, such as pedestrians, traffic signs and lanes. In this paper, a simple and efficient topology-aware energy loss function-based network training strategy named EIEGSeg is proposed. EIEGSeg is designed for multi-class segmentation on real-time traffic scene perception. To be specific, the convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts image features and produces multiple outputs, and the elastic interaction energy loss function (EIEL) drives the predictions moving toward the ground truth until they are completely overlapped. Our strategy performs well especially on fine-scale structure, \textit{i.e.} small or irregularly shaped objects can be identified more accurately, and discontinuity issues on slender objects can be improved. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyze our method on three traffic datasets, including urban scene segmentation data Cityscapes and lane detection data TuSimple and CULane. Our results demonstrate that EIEGSeg consistently improves the performance, especially on real-time, lightweight networks that are better suited for autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>SignAvatars: A Large-scale 3D Sign Language Holistic Motion Dataset and Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SignAvatars, the first large-scale, multi-prompt 3D sign language (SL) motion dataset designed to bridge the communication gap for Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. While there has been an exponentially growing number of research regarding digital communication, the majority of existing communication technologies primarily cater to spoken or written languages, instead of SL, the essential communication method for Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. Existing SL datasets, dictionaries, and sign language production (SLP) methods are typically limited to 2D as annotating 3D models and avatars for SL is usually an entirely manual and labor-intensive process conducted by SL experts, often resulting in unnatural avatars. In response to these challenges, we compile and curate the SignAvatars dataset, which comprises 70,000 videos from 153 signers, totaling 8.34 million frames, covering both isolated signs and continuous, co-articulated signs, with multiple prompts including HamNoSys, spoken language, and words. To yield 3D holistic annotations, including meshes and biomechanically-valid poses of body, hands, and face, as well as 2D and 3D keypoints, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline operating on our large corpus of SL videos. SignAvatars facilitates various tasks such as 3D sign language recognition (SLR) and the novel 3D SL production (SLP) from diverse inputs like text scripts, individual words, and HamNoSys notation. Hence, to evaluate the potential of SignAvatars, we further propose a unified benchmark of 3D SL holistic motion production. We believe that this work is a significant step forward towards bringing the digital world to the Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities as well as people interacting with them.</description>

      <title>MetaCloak: Preventing Unauthorized Subject-driven Text-to-image Diffusion-based Synthesis via Meta-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized images from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can fabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address this problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them "unlearnable" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an additional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services like Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of MetaCloak in real-world scenarios.

      <description>arXiv:2311.16432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language has emerged as a natural interface for image editing. In this paper, we introduce a method for region-based image editing driven by textual prompts, without the need for user-provided masks or sketches. Specifically, our approach leverages an existing pre-trained text-to-image model and introduces a bounding box generator to identify the editing regions that are aligned with the textual prompts. We show that this simple approach enables flexible editing that is compatible with current image generation models, and is able to handle complex prompts featuring multiple objects, complex sentences, or lengthy paragraphs. We conduct an extensive user study to compare our method against state-of-the-art methods. The experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our method in manipulating images with high fidelity and realism that correspond to the provided language descriptions.

      <title>LLaFS: When Large Language Models Meet Few-Shot Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16926v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes LLaFS, the first attempt to leverage large language models (LLMs) in few-shot segmentation. In contrast to the conventional few-shot segmentation methods that only rely on the limited and biased information from the annotated support images, LLaFS leverages the vast prior knowledge gained by LLM as an effective supplement and directly uses the LLM to segment images in a few-shot manner. To enable the text-based LLM to handle image-related tasks, we carefully design an input instruction that allows the LLM to produce segmentation results represented as polygons, and propose a region-attribute table to simulate the human visual mechanism and provide multi-modal guidance. We also synthesize pseudo samples and use curriculum learning for pretraining to augment data and achieve better optimization. LLaFS achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets, showing the potential of using LLMs for few-shot computer vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion 3D Features (Diff3F): Decorating Untextured Shapes with Distilled Semantic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Diff3F as a simple, robust, and class-agnostic feature descriptor that can be computed for untextured input shapes (meshes or point clouds). Our method distills diffusion features from image foundational models onto input shapes. Specifically, we use the input shapes to produce depth and normal maps as guidance for conditional image synthesis. In the process, we produce (diffusion) features in 2D that we subsequently lift and aggregate on the original surface. Our key observation is that even if the conditional image generations obtained from multi-view rendering of the input shapes are inconsistent, the associated image features are robust and, hence, can be directly aggregated across views. This produces semantic features on the input shapes, without requiring additional data or training. We perform extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SHREC'19, SHREC'20, FAUST, and TOSCA) and demonstrate that our features, being semantic instead of geometric, produce reliable correspondence across both isometric and non-isometrically related shape families.

      <description>arXiv:2311.17919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of synthesizing multi-view optical illusions: images that change appearance upon a transformation, such as a flip or rotation. We propose a simple, zero-shot method for obtaining these illusions from off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models. During the reverse diffusion process, we estimate the noise from different views of a noisy image, and then combine these noise estimates together and denoise the image. A theoretical analysis suggests that this method works precisely for views that can be written as orthogonal transformations, of which permutations are a subset. This leads to the idea of a visual anagram--an image that changes appearance under some rearrangement of pixels. This includes rotations and flips, but also more exotic pixel permutations such as a jigsaw rearrangement. Our approach also naturally extends to illusions with more than two views. We provide both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of our method. Please see our project webpage for additional visualizations and results: https://dangeng.github.io/visual_anagrams/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contents generated by recent advanced Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models are sometimes too imaginative for existing off-the-shelf dense predictors to estimate due to the immitigable domain gap. We introduce DMP, a pipeline utilizing pre-trained T2I models as a prior for dense prediction tasks. To address the misalignment between deterministic prediction tasks and stochastic T2I models, we reformulate the diffusion process through a sequence of interpolations, establishing a deterministic mapping between input RGB images and output prediction distributions. To preserve generalizability, we use low-rank adaptation to fine-tune pre-trained models. Extensive experiments across five tasks, including 3D property estimation, semantic segmentation, and intrinsic image decomposition, showcase the efficacy of the proposed method. Despite limited-domain training data, the approach yields faithful estimations for arbitrary images, surpassing existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of objects unseen during training is highly desirable yet challenging. Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios. FreeZe consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches, including competitors extensively trained on synthetic 6D pose estimation data.

      <title>Omni-SMoLA: Boosting Generalist Multimodal Models with Soft Mixture of Low-rank Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) exhibit remarkable performance across numerous tasks. However, generalist LMMs often suffer from performance degradation when tuned over a large collection of tasks. Recent research suggests that Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures are useful for instruction tuning, but for LMMs of parameter size around O(50-100B), the prohibitive cost of replicating and storing the expert models severely limits the number of experts we can use. We propose Omni-SMoLA, an architecture that uses the Soft MoE approach to (softly) mix many multimodal low rank experts, and avoids introducing a significant number of new parameters compared to conventional MoE models. The core intuition here is that the large model provides a foundational backbone, while different lightweight experts residually learn specialized knowledge, either per-modality or multimodally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SMoLA approach helps improve the generalist performance across a broad range of generative vision-and-language tasks, achieving new SoTA generalist performance that often matches or outperforms single specialized LMM baselines, as well as new SoTA specialist performance.</description>

      <title>Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is a fundamental computer vision task. Recovering 3D depth from a single image is geometrically ill-posed and requires scene understanding, so it is not surprising that the rise of deep learning has led to a breakthrough. The impressive progress of monocular depth estimators has mirrored the growth in model capacity, from relatively modest CNNs to large Transformer architectures. Still, monocular depth estimators tend to struggle when presented with images with unfamiliar content and layout, since their knowledge of the visual world is restricted by the data seen during training, and challenged by zero-shot generalization to new domains. This motivates us to explore whether the extensive priors captured in recent generative diffusion models can enable better, more generalizable depth estimation. We introduce Marigold, a method for affine-invariant monocular depth estimation that is derived from Stable Diffusion and retains its rich prior knowledge. The estimator can be fine-tuned in a couple of days on a single GPU using only synthetic training data. It delivers state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of datasets, including over 20% performance gains in specific cases. Project page: https://marigoldmonodepth.github.io.</description>

      <title>Readout Guidance: Learning Control from Diffusion Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Readout Guidance, a method for controlling text-to-image diffusion models with learned signals. Readout Guidance uses readout heads, lightweight networks trained to extract signals from the features of a pre-trained, frozen diffusion model at every timestep. These readouts can encode single-image properties, such as pose, depth, and edges; or higher-order properties that relate multiple images, such as correspondence and appearance similarity. Furthermore, by comparing the readout estimates to a user-defined target, and back-propagating the gradient through the readout head, these estimates can be used to guide the sampling process. Compared to prior methods for conditional generation, Readout Guidance requires significantly fewer added parameters and training samples, and offers a convenient and simple recipe for reproducing different forms of conditional control under a single framework, with a single architecture and sampling procedure. We showcase these benefits in the applications of drag-based manipulation, identity-consistent generation, and spatially aligned control.

      <title>Language-Informed Visual Concept Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of the visual world is centered around various concept axes, characterizing different aspects of visual entities. While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g. color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g. a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Good Prompt Learners for Low-Shot Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-shot image classification, where training images are limited or inaccessible, has benefited from recent progress on pre-trained vision-language (VL) models with strong generalizability, e.g. CLIP. Prompt learning methods built with VL models generate text features from the class names that only have confined class-specific information. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their vast encyclopedic knowledge, emerge as the complement. Thus, in this paper, we discuss the integration of LLMs to enhance pre-trained VL models, specifically on low-shot classification. However, the domain gap between language and vision blocks the direct application of LLMs. Thus, we propose LLaMP, Large Language Models as Prompt learners, that produces adaptive prompts for the CLIP text encoder, establishing it as the connecting bridge. Experiments show that, compared with other state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, LLaMP yields better performance on both zero-shot generalization and few-shot image classification, over a spectrum of 11 datasets. Code will be made available at: https://github.com/zhaohengz/LLaMP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce DyNFL, a novel neural field-based approach for high-fidelity re-simulation of LiDAR scans in dynamic driving scenes. DyNFL processes LiDAR measurements from dynamic environments, accompanied by bounding boxes of moving objects, to construct an editable neural field. This field, comprising separately reconstructed static background and dynamic objects, allows users to modify viewpoints, adjust object positions, and seamlessly add or remove objects in the re-simulated scene. A key innovation of our method is the neural field composition technique, which effectively integrates reconstructed neural assets from various scenes through a ray drop test, accounting for occlusions and transparent surfaces. Our evaluation with both synthetic and real-world environments demonstrates that DyNFL substantially improves dynamic scene LiDAR simulation, offering a combination of physical fidelity and flexible editing capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on label efficient learning for video action detection. We develop a novel semi-supervised active learning approach which utilizes both labeled as well as unlabeled data along with informative sample selection for action detection. Video action detection requires spatio-temporal localization along with classification, which poses several challenges for both active learning informative sample selection as well as semi-supervised learning pseudo label generation. First, we propose NoiseAug, a simple augmentation strategy which effectively selects informative samples for video action detection. Next, we propose fft-attention, a novel technique based on high-pass filtering which enables effective utilization of pseudo label for SSL in video action detection by emphasizing on relevant activity region within a video. We evaluate the proposed approach on three different benchmark datasets, UCF-101-24, JHMDB-21, and Youtube-VOS. First, we demonstrate its effectiveness on video action detection where the proposed approach outperforms prior works in semi-supervised and weakly-supervised learning along with several baseline approaches in both UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21. Next, we also show its effectiveness on Youtube-VOS for video object segmentation demonstrating its generalization capability for other dense prediction tasks in videos. The code and models is publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/AKASH2907/semi-sup-active-learning}.</description>

      <title>SeiT++: Masked Token Modeling Improves Storage-efficient Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have significantly improved performance across computer vision tasks. However, achieving highly generalizable and high-performing vision models requires expansive datasets, resulting in significant storage requirements. This storage challenge is a critical bottleneck for scaling up models. A recent breakthrough by SeiT proposed the use of Vector-Quantized (VQ) feature vectors (i.e., tokens) as network inputs for vision classification. This approach achieved 90% of the performance of a model trained on full-pixel images with only 1% of the storage. While SeiT needs labeled data, its potential in scenarios beyond fully supervised learning remains largely untapped. In this paper, we extend SeiT by integrating Masked Token Modeling (MTM) for self-supervised pre-training. Recognizing that self-supervised approaches often demand more data due to the lack of labels, we introduce TokenAdapt and ColorAdapt. These methods facilitate comprehensive token-friendly data augmentation, effectively addressing the increased data requirements of self-supervised learning. We evaluate our approach across various scenarios, including storage-efficient ImageNet-1k classification, fine-grained classification, ADE-20k semantic segmentation, and robustness benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvement in diverse experiments, validating the effectiveness of our method.

      <description>arXiv:2312.10389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of lane detection involves identifying the boundaries of driving areas in real-time. Recognizing lanes with variable and complex geometric structures remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore a novel and flexible way of implicit lanes representation named \textit{Elastic Lane map (ELM)}, and introduce an efficient physics-informed end-to-end lane detection framework, namely, ElasticLaneNet (Elastic interaction energy-informed Lane detection Network). The approach considers predicted lanes as moving zero-contours on the flexibly shaped \textit{ELM} that are attracted to the ground truth guided by an elastic interaction energy-loss function (EIE loss). Our framework well integrates the global information and low-level features. The method performs well in complex lane scenarios, including those with large curvature, weak geometry features at intersections, complicated cross lanes, Y-shapes lanes, dense lanes, etc. We apply our approach on three datasets: SDLane, CULane, and TuSimple. The results demonstrate exceptional performance of our method, with the state-of-the-art results on the structurally diverse SDLane, achieving F1-score of 89.51, Recall rate of 87.50, and Precision of 91.61 with fast inference speed.</description>

      <title>Your Student is Better Than Expected: Adaptive Teacher-Student Collaboration for Text-Conditional Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation methods have recently shown to be a promising direction to speedup the synthesis of large-scale diffusion models by requiring only a few inference steps. While several powerful distillation methods were recently proposed, the overall quality of student samples is typically lower compared to the teacher ones, which hinders their practical usage. In this work, we investigate the relative quality of samples produced by the teacher text-to-image diffusion model and its distilled student version. As our main empirical finding, we discover that a noticeable portion of student samples exhibit superior fidelity compared to the teacher ones, despite the "approximate" nature of the student. Based on this finding, we propose an adaptive collaboration between student and teacher diffusion models for effective text-to-image synthesis. Specifically, the distilled model produces the initial sample, and then an oracle decides whether it needs further improvements with a slow teacher model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the designed pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art text-to-image alternatives for various inference budgets in terms of human preference. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be naturally used in popular applications such as text-guided image editing and controllable generation.</description>

      <title>Learning Object State Changes in Videos: An Open-World Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object State Changes (OSCs) are pivotal for video understanding. While humans can effortlessly generalize OSC understanding from familiar to unknown objects, current approaches are confined to a closed vocabulary. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel open-world formulation for the video OSC problem. The goal is to temporally localize the three stages of an OSC -- the object's initial state, its transitioning state, and its end state -- whether or not the object has been observed during training. Towards this end, we develop VidOSC, a holistic learning approach that: (1) leverages text and vision-language models for supervisory signals to obviate manually labeling OSC training data, and (2) abstracts fine-grained shared state representations from objects to enhance generalization. Furthermore, we present HowToChange, the first open-world benchmark for video OSC localization, which offers an order of magnitude increase in the label space and annotation volume compared to the best existing benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, in both traditional closed-world and open-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Diffusion Noise Can Serve As Universal Motion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), a new method that effectively leverages existing motion diffusion models as motion priors for a wide range of motion-related tasks. Instead of training a task-specific diffusion model for each new task, DNO operates by optimizing the diffusion latent noise of an existing pre-trained text-to-motion model. Given the corresponding latent noise of a human motion, it propagates the gradient from the target criteria defined on the motion space through the whole denoising process to update the diffusion latent noise. As a result, DNO supports any use cases where criteria can be defined as a function of motion. In particular, we show that, for motion editing and control, DNO outperforms existing methods in both achieving the objective and preserving the motion content. DNO accommodates a diverse range of editing modes, including changing trajectory, pose, joint locations, or avoiding newly added obstacles. In addition, DNO is effective in motion denoising and completion, producing smooth and realistic motion from noisy and partial inputs. DNO achieves these results at inference time without the need for model retraining, offering great versatility for any defined reward or loss function on the motion representation.</description>

      <title>TAO-Amodal: A Benchmark for Tracking Any Object Amodally</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amodal perception, the ability to comprehend complete object structures from partial visibility, is a fundamental skill, even for infants. Its significance extends to applications like autonomous driving, where a clear understanding of heavily occluded objects is essential. However, modern detection and tracking algorithms often overlook this critical capability, perhaps due to the prevalence of \textit{modal} annotations in most benchmarks. To address the scarcity of amodal benchmarks, we introduce TAO-Amodal, featuring 833 diverse categories in thousands of video sequences. Our dataset includes \textit{amodal} and modal bounding boxes for visible and partially or fully occluded objects, including those that are partially out of the camera frame. We investigate the current lay of the land in both amodal tracking and detection by benchmarking state-of-the-art modal trackers and amodal segmentation methods. We find that existing methods, even when adapted for amodal tracking, struggle to detect and track objects under heavy occlusion. To mitigate this, we explore simple finetuning schemes that can increase the amodal tracking and detection metrics of occluded objects by 2.1\% and 3.3\%.</description>

      <title>RadEdit: stress-testing biomedical vision models via diffusion image editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomedical imaging datasets are often small and biased, meaning that real-world performance of predictive models can be substantially lower than expected from internal testing. This work proposes using generative image editing to simulate dataset shifts and diagnose failure modes of biomedical vision models; this can be used in advance of deployment to assess readiness, potentially reducing cost and patient harm. Existing editing methods can produce undesirable changes, with spurious correlations learned due to the co-occurrence of disease and treatment interventions, limiting practical applicability. To address this, we train a text-to-image diffusion model on multiple chest X-ray datasets and introduce a new editing method RadEdit that uses multiple masks, if present, to constrain changes and ensure consistency in the edited images. We consider three types of dataset shifts: acquisition shift, manifestation shift, and population shift, and demonstrate that our approach can diagnose failures and quantify model robustness without additional data collection, complementing more qualitative tools for explainable AI.</description>

      <title>The Audio-Visual Conversational Graph: From an Egocentric-Exocentric Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the thriving development of research related to egocentric videos has provided a unique perspective for the study of conversational interactions, where both visual and audio signals play a crucial role. While most prior work focus on learning about behaviors that directly involve the camera wearer, we introduce the Ego-Exocentric Conversational Graph Prediction problem, marking the first attempt to infer exocentric conversational interactions from egocentric videos. We propose a unified multi-modal framework -- Audio-Visual Conversational Attention (AV-CONV), for the joint prediction of conversation behaviors -- speaking and listening -- for both the camera wearer as well as all other social partners present in the egocentric video. Specifically, we adopt the self-attention mechanism to model the representations across-time, across-subjects, and across-modalities. To validate our method, we conduct experiments on a challenging egocentric video dataset that includes multi-speaker and multi-conversation scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to a series of baselines. We also present detailed ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component in our model. Check our project page at https://vjwq.github.io/AV-CONV/.</description>

      <title>Three Heads Are Better Than One: Complementary Experts for Long-Tailed Semi-supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenging problem of Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) where labeled data exhibit imbalanced class distribution and unlabeled data follow an unknown distribution. Unlike in balanced SSL, the generated pseudo-labels are skewed towards head classes, intensifying the training bias. Such a phenomenon is even amplified as more unlabeled data will be mislabeled as head classes when the class distribution of labeled and unlabeled datasets are mismatched. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method named ComPlementary Experts (CPE). Specifically, we train multiple experts to model various class distributions, each of them yielding high-quality pseudo-labels within one form of class distribution. Besides, we introduce Classwise Batch Normalization for CPE to avoid performance degradation caused by feature distribution mismatch between head and non-head classes. CPE achieves state-of-the-art performances on CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and STL-10-LT dataset benchmarks. For instance, on CIFAR-10-LT, CPE improves test accuracy by over 2.22% compared to baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/machengcheng2016/CPE-LTSSL.</description>

      <title>3D Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation with 2D-3D Vision-Language Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D panoptic segmentation is a challenging perception task, especially in autonomous driving. It aims to predict both semantic and instance annotations for 3D points in a scene. Although prior 3D panoptic segmentation approaches have achieved great performance on closed-set benchmarks, generalizing these approaches to unseen things and unseen stuff categories remains an open problem. For unseen object categories, 2D open-vocabulary segmentation has achieved promising results that solely rely on frozen CLIP backbones and ensembling multiple classification outputs. However, we find that simply extending these 2D models to 3D does not guarantee good performance due to poor per-mask classification quality, especially for novel stuff categories. In this paper, we propose the first method to tackle 3D open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Our model takes advantage of the fusion between learnable LiDAR features and dense frozen vision CLIP features, using a single classification head to make predictions for both base and novel classes. To further improve the classification performance on novel classes and leverage the CLIP model, we propose two novel loss functions: object-level distillation loss and voxel-level distillation loss. Our experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets show that our method outperforms the strong baseline by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Data-Driven Spectral Reconstruction -- Optics-Aware Analysis and Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging empowers machine vision systems with the distinct capability of identifying materials through recording their spectral signatures. Recent efforts in data-driven spectral reconstruction aim at extracting spectral information from RGB images captured by cost-effective RGB cameras, instead of dedicated hardware.
  In this paper we systematically analyze the performance of such methods, evaluating both the practical limitations with respect to current datasets and overfitting, as well as fundamental limitations with respect to the nature of the information encoded in the RGB images, and the dependency of this information on the optical system of the camera.
  We find that, the current models are not robust under slight variations, e.g., in noise level or compression of the RGB file. Without modeling underrepresented spectral content, existing datasets and the models trained on them are limited in their ability to cope with challenging metameric colors. To mitigate this issue, we propose to exploit the combination of metameric data augmentation and optical lens aberrations to improve the encoding of the metameric information into the RGB image, which paves the road towards higher performing spectral imaging and reconstruction approaches.</description>

      <title>Advancing Ante-Hoc Explainable Models through Generative Adversarial Networks</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel concept learning framework for enhancing model interpretability and performance in visual classification tasks. Our approach appends an unsupervised explanation generator to the primary classifier network and makes use of adversarial training. During training, the explanation module is optimized to extract visual concepts from the classifier's latent representations, while the GAN-based module aims to discriminate images generated from concepts, from true images. This joint training scheme enables the model to implicitly align its internally learned concepts with human-interpretable visual properties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach, while producing coherent concept activations. We analyse the learned concepts, showing their semantic concordance with object parts and visual attributes. We also study how perturbations in the adversarial training protocol impact both classification and concept acquisition. In summary, this work presents a significant step towards building inherently interpretable deep vision models with task-aligned concept representations - a key enabler for developing trustworthy AI for real-world perception tasks.</description>

      <title>Understanding Video Transformers via Universal Concept Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of concept-based interpretability of transformer representations for videos. Concretely, we seek to explain the decision-making process of video transformers based on high-level, spatiotemporal concepts that are automatically discovered. Prior research on concept-based interpretability has concentrated solely on image-level tasks. Comparatively, video models deal with the added temporal dimension, increasing complexity and posing challenges in identifying dynamic concepts over time. In this work, we systematically address these challenges by introducing the first Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm. To this end, we propose an efficient approach for unsupervised identification of units of video transformer representations - concepts, and ranking their importance to the output of a model. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable, revealing spatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstructured video models. Performing this analysis jointly over a diverse set of supervised and self-supervised representations, we discover that some of these mechanism are universal in video transformers. Finally, we show that VTCD can be used for fine-grained action recognition and video object segmentation.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of computer vision has seen the emergence of various foundation models, each tailored to specific data types and tasks. In this study, we explore the adaptation of these models for few-shot semantic segmentation. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of four prominent foundation models: DINO V2, Segment Anything, CLIP, Masked AutoEncoders, and of a straightforward ResNet50 pre-trained on the COCO dataset. We also include 5 adaptation methods, ranging from linear probing to fine tuning. Our findings show that DINO V2 outperforms other models by a large margin, across various datasets and adaptation methods. On the other hand, adaptation methods provide little discrepancy in the obtained results, suggesting that a simple linear probing can compete with advanced, more computationally intensive, alternatives</description>

      <title>MLLMReID: Multimodal Large Language Model-based Person Re-identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLM) have achieved satisfactory results in many tasks. However, their performance in the task of person re-identification (ReID) has not been explored to date. This paper will investigate how to adapt them for the task of ReID. An intuitive idea is to fine-tune MLLM with ReID image-text datasets, and then use their visual encoder as a backbone for ReID. However, there still exist two apparent issues: (1) Designing instructions for ReID, MLLMs may overfit specific instructions, and designing a variety of instructions will lead to higher costs. (2) Latent image feature vectors from LLMs are not involved in loss computation. Instructional learning, aligning image-text features, results in indirect optimization and a learning objective that inadequately utilizes features, limiting effectiveness in person feature learning. To address these problems, this paper proposes MLLMReID: Multimodal Large Language Model-based ReID. Firstly, we proposed Common Instruction, a simple approach that leverages the essence ability of LLMs to continue writing, avoiding complex and diverse instruction design. Secondly, we proposed DirectReID, which effectively employs the latent image feature vectors of images outputted by LLMs in ReID tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method. We will open-source the code on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SUPIR (Scaling-UP Image Restoration), a groundbreaking image restoration method that harnesses generative prior and the power of model scaling up. Leveraging multi-modal techniques and advanced generative prior, SUPIR marks a significant advance in intelligent and realistic image restoration. As a pivotal catalyst within SUPIR, model scaling dramatically enhances its capabilities and demonstrates new potential for image restoration. We collect a dataset comprising 20 million high-resolution, high-quality images for model training, each enriched with descriptive text annotations. SUPIR provides the capability to restore images guided by textual prompts, broadening its application scope and potential. Moreover, we introduce negative-quality prompts to further improve perceptual quality. We also develop a restoration-guided sampling method to suppress the fidelity issue encountered in generative-based restoration. Experiments demonstrate SUPIR's exceptional restoration effects and its novel capacity to manipulate restoration through textual prompts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15204v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based solutions have proven successful in the domains of image enhancement. This paper introduces LYT-Net, or Lightweight YUV Transformer-based Network, as a novel approach for low-light image enhancement. The proposed architecture, distinct from conventional Retinex-based models, leverages the YUV color space's natural separation of luminance (Y) and chrominance (U and V) to simplify the intricate task of disentangling light and color information in images. By utilizing the strengths of transformers, known for their capability to capture long-range dependencies, LYT-Net ensures a comprehensive contextual understanding of the image while maintaining reduced model complexity. By employing a novel hybrid loss function, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on low-light image enhancement datasets, all while being considerably more compact than its counterparts. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/albrateanu/LYT-Net</description>

      <title>Robustness Assessment of a Runway Object Classifier for Safe Aircraft Taxiing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming the prominent solution for many computational problems, the aviation industry seeks to explore their potential in alleviating pilot workload and in improving operational safety. However, the use of DNNs in this type of safety-critical applications requires a thorough certification process. This need can be addressed through formal verification, which provides rigorous assurances -- e.g.,~by proving the absence of certain mispredictions. In this case-study paper, we demonstrate this process using an image-classifier DNN currently under development at Airbus and intended for use during the aircraft taxiing phase. We use formal methods to assess this DNN's robustness to three common image perturbation types: noise, brightness and contrast, and some of their combinations. This process entails multiple invocations of the underlying verifier, which might be computationally expensive; and we therefore propose a method that leverages the monotonicity of these robustness properties, as well as the results of past verification queries, in order to reduce the overall number of verification queries required by nearly 60%. Our results provide an indication of the level of robustness achieved by the DNN classifier under study, and indicate that it is considerably more vulnerable to noise than to brightness or contrast perturbations.</description>

      <title>Task-conditioned adaptation of visual features in multi-task policy learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Successfully addressing a wide variety of tasks is a core ability of autonomous agents, requiring flexibly adapting the underlying decision-making strategies and, as we argue in this work, also adapting the perception modules. An analogical argument would be the human visual system, which uses top-down signals to focus attention determined by the current task. Similarly, we adapt pre-trained large vision models conditioned on specific downstream tasks in the context of multi-task policy learning. We introduce task-conditioned adapters that do not require finetuning any pre-trained weights, combined with a single policy trained with behavior cloning and capable of addressing multiple tasks. We condition the visual adapters on task embeddings, which can be selected at inference if the task is known, or alternatively inferred from a set of example demonstrations. To this end, we propose a new optimization-based estimator. We evaluate the method on a wide variety of tasks from the CortexBench benchmark and show that, compared to existing work, it can be addressed with a single policy. In particular, we demonstrate that adapting visual features is a key design choice and that the method generalizes to unseen tasks given a few demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Towards Seamless Adaptation of Pre-trained Models for Visual Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies show that vision models pre-trained in generic visual learning tasks with large-scale data can provide useful feature representations for a wide range of visual perception problems. However, few attempts have been made to exploit pre-trained foundation models in visual place recognition (VPR). Due to the inherent difference in training objectives and data between the tasks of model pre-training and VPR, how to bridge the gap and fully unleash the capability of pre-trained models for VPR is still a key issue to address. To this end, we propose a novel method to realize seamless adaptation of pre-trained models for VPR. Specifically, to obtain both global and local features that focus on salient landmarks for discriminating places, we design a hybrid adaptation method to achieve both global and local adaptation efficiently, in which only lightweight adapters are tuned without adjusting the pre-trained model. Besides, to guide effective adaptation, we propose a mutual nearest neighbor local feature loss, which ensures proper dense local features are produced for local matching and avoids time-consuming spatial verification in re-ranking. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with less training data and training time, and uses about only 3% retrieval runtime of the two-stage VPR methods with RANSAC-based spatial verification. It ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard (at the time of submission). The code is released at https://github.com/Lu-Feng/SelaVPR.</description>

      <title>OSCaR: Object State Captioning and State Change Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17128v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capability of intelligent models to extrapolate and comprehend changes in object states is a crucial yet demanding aspect of AI research, particularly through the lens of human interaction in real-world settings. This task involves describing complex visual environments, identifying active objects, and interpreting their changes as conveyed through language. Traditional methods, which isolate object captioning and state change detection, offer a limited view of dynamic environments. Moreover, relying on a small set of symbolic words to represent changes has restricted the expressiveness of the language. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the Object State Captioning and State Change Representation (OSCaR) dataset and benchmark. OSCaR consists of 14,084 annotated video segments with nearly 1,000 unique objects from various egocentric video collections. It sets a new testbed for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our experiments demonstrate that while MLLMs show some skill, they lack a full understanding of object state changes. The benchmark includes a fine-tuned model that, despite initial capabilities, requires significant improvements in accuracy and generalization ability for effective understanding of these changes. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/nguyennm1024/OSCaR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel 3D generative method, Generative 3D Reconstruction (G3DR) in ImageNet, capable of generating diverse and high-quality 3D objects from single images, addressing the limitations of existing methods. At the heart of our framework is a novel depth regularization technique that enables the generation of scenes with high-geometric fidelity. G3DR also leverages a pretrained language-vision model, such as CLIP, to enable reconstruction in novel views and improve the visual realism of generations. Additionally, G3DR designs a simple but effective sampling procedure to further improve the quality of generations. G3DR offers diverse and efficient 3D asset generation based on class or text conditioning. Despite its simplicity, G3DR is able to beat state-of-theart methods, improving over them by up to 22% in perceptual metrics and 90% in geometry scores, while needing only half of the training time.

      <title>Semantic Human Mesh Reconstruction with Textures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of 3D detailed human mesh reconstruction has made significant progress in recent years. However, current methods still face challenges when used in industrial applications due to unstable results, low-quality meshes, and a lack of UV unwrapping and skinning weights. In this paper, we present SHERT, a novel pipeline that can reconstruct semantic human meshes with textures and high-precision details. SHERT applies semantic- and normal-based sampling between the detailed surface (e.g. mesh and SDF) and the corresponding SMPL-X model to obtain a partially sampled semantic mesh and then generates the complete semantic mesh by our specifically designed self-supervised completion and refinement networks. Using the complete semantic mesh as a basis, we employ a texture diffusion model to create human textures that are driven by both images and texts. Our reconstructed meshes have stable UV unwrapping, high-quality triangle meshes, and consistent semantic information. The given SMPL-X model provides semantic information and shape priors, allowing SHERT to perform well even with incorrect and incomplete inputs. The semantic information also makes it easy to substitute and animate different body parts such as the face, body, and hands. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SHERT is capable of producing high-fidelity and robust semantic meshes that outperform state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Sample-Guided and Parameter-Efficient Feature Space Adaptation for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we look at cross-domain few-shot classification which presents the challenging task of learning new classes in previously unseen domains with few labelled examples. Existing methods, though somewhat effective, encounter several limitations, which we alleviate through two significant improvements. First, we introduce a lightweight parameter-efficient adaptation strategy to address overfitting associated with fine-tuning a large number of parameters on small datasets. This strategy employs a linear transformation of pre-trained features, significantly reducing the trainable parameter count. Second, we replace the traditional nearest centroid classifier with a discriminative sample-aware loss function, enhancing the model's sensitivity to the inter- and intra-class variances within the training set for improved clustering in feature space. Empirical evaluations on the Meta-Dataset benchmark showcase that our approach not only improves accuracy up to 7.7\% and 5.3\% on previously seen and unseen datasets, respectively, but also achieves the above performance while being at least $\sim3\times$ more parameter-efficient than existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in cross-domain few-shot learning.

      <description>arXiv:2403.05839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current event-/frame-event based trackers undergo evaluation on short-term tracking datasets, however, the tracking of real-world scenarios involves long-term tracking, and the performance of existing tracking algorithms in these scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we first propose a new long-term and large-scale frame-event single object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 742 videos and 1,594,474 RGB frames and event stream pairs and has become the largest frame-event tracking dataset to date. We re-train and evaluate 15 baseline trackers on our dataset for future works to compare. More importantly, we find that the RGB frames and event streams are naturally incomplete due to the influence of challenging factors and spatially sparse event flow. In response to this, we propose a novel associative memory Transformer network as a unified backbone by introducing modern Hopfield layers into multi-head self-attention blocks to fuse both RGB and event data. Extensive experiments on RGB-Event (FELT), RGB-Thermal (RGBT234, LasHeR), and RGB-Depth (DepthTrack) datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our model. The dataset and source code can be found at \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/FELT_SOT_Benchmark}.</description>

      <title>Analytic-Splatting: Anti-Aliased 3D Gaussian Splatting via Analytic Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gained its popularity recently by combining the advantages of both primitive-based and volumetric 3D representations, resulting in improved quality and efficiency for 3D scene rendering. However, 3DGS is not alias-free, and its rendering at varying resolutions could produce severe blurring or jaggies. This is because 3DGS treats each pixel as an isolated, single point rather than as an area, causing insensitivity to changes in the footprints of pixels. Consequently, this discrete sampling scheme inevitably results in aliasing, owing to the restricted sampling bandwidth. In this paper, we derive an analytical solution to address this issue. More specifically, we use a conditioned logistic function as the analytic approximation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a one-dimensional Gaussian signal and calculate the Gaussian integral by subtracting the CDFs. We then introduce this approximation in the two-dimensional pixel shading, and present Analytic-Splatting, which analytically approximates the Gaussian integral within the 2D-pixel window area to better capture the intensity response of each pixel. Moreover, we use the approximated response of the pixel window integral area to participate in the transmittance calculation of volume rendering, making Analytic-Splatting sensitive to the changes in pixel footprint at different resolutions. Experiments on various datasets validate that our approach has better anti-aliasing capability that gives more details and better fidelity.</description>

Despite their progress, challenges remain in both prompt-following ability, image quality and lack of high-quality datasets, which are essential for refining these models. As acquiring labeled data is costly, we introduce AGFSync, a framework that enhances T2I diffusion models through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in a fully AI-driven approach. AGFSync utilizes Vision-Language Models (VLM) to assess image quality across style, coherence, and aesthetics, generating feedback data within an AI-driven loop. By applying AGFSync to leading T2I models such as SD v1.4, v1.5, and SDXL, our extensive experiments on the TIFA dataset demonstrate notable improvements in VQA scores, aesthetic evaluations, and performance on the HPSv2 benchmark, consistently outperforming the base models. AGFSync's method of refining T2I diffusion models paves the way for scalable alignment techniques.</description>

      <title>HAC: Hash-grid Assisted Context for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising framework for novel view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To address this, we make use of the relations between the unorganized anchors and the structured hash grid, leveraging their mutual information for context modeling, and propose a Hash-grid Assisted Context (HAC) framework for highly compact 3DGS representation. Our approach introduces a binary hash grid to establish continuous spatial consistencies, allowing us to unveil the inherent spatial relations of anchors through a carefully designed context model. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to accurately estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Importantly, our work is the pioneer to explore context-based compression for 3DGS representation, resulting in a remarkable size reduction of over $75\times$ compared to vanilla 3DGS, while simultaneously improving fidelity, and achieving over $11\times$ size reduction over SOTA 3DGS compression approach Scaffold-GS.

      <title>Burst Super-Resolution with Diffusion Models for Improving Perceptual Quality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While burst LR images are useful for improving the SR image quality compared with a single LR image, prior SR networks accepting the burst LR images are trained in a deterministic manner, which is known to produce a blurry SR image. In addition, it is difficult to perfectly align the burst LR images, making the SR image more blurry. Since such blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct the sharp high-fidelity boundaries. Such high-fidelity images can be reconstructed by diffusion models. However, prior SR methods using the diffusion model are not properly optimized for the burst SR task. Specifically, the reverse process starting from a random sample is not optimized for image enhancement and restoration methods, including burst SR. In our proposed method, on the other hand, burst LR features are used to reconstruct the initial burst SR image that is fed into an intermediate step in the diffusion model. This reverse process from the intermediate step 1) skips diffusion steps for reconstructing the global structure of the image and 2) focuses on steps for refining detailed textures. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can improve the scores of the perceptual quality metrics. Code: https://github.com/placerkyo/BSRD</description>

      <title>Is Synthetic Image Useful for Transfer Learning? An Investigation into Data Generation, Volume, and Utilization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic image data generation represents a promising avenue for training deep learning models, particularly in the realm of transfer learning, where obtaining real images within a specific domain can be prohibitively expensive due to privacy and intellectual property considerations. This work delves into the generation and utilization of synthetic images derived from text-to-image generative models in facilitating transfer learning paradigms. Despite the high visual fidelity of the generated images, we observe that their naive incorporation into existing real-image datasets does not consistently enhance model performance due to the inherent distribution gap between synthetic and real images. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage framework called bridged transfer, which initially employs synthetic images for fine-tuning a pre-trained model to improve its transferability and subsequently uses real data for rapid adaptation. Alongside, We propose dataset style inversion strategy to improve the stylistic alignment between synthetic and real images. Our proposed methods are evaluated across 10 different datasets and 5 distinct models, demonstrating consistent improvements, with up to 30% accuracy increase on classification tasks. Intriguingly, we note that the enhancements were not yet saturated, indicating that the benefits may further increase with an expanded volume of synthetic data.</description>

      <title>MI-NeRF: Learning a Single Face NeRF from Multiple Identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a method that learns a single dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) from monocular talking face videos of multiple identities. NeRFs have shown remarkable results in modeling the 4D dynamics and appearance of human faces. However, they require per-identity optimization. Although recent approaches have proposed techniques to reduce the training and rendering time, increasing the number of identities can be expensive. We introduce MI-NeRF (multi-identity NeRF), a single unified network that models complex non-rigid facial motion for multiple identities, using only monocular videos of arbitrary length. The core premise in our method is to learn the non-linear interactions between identity and non-identity specific information with a multiplicative module. By training on multiple videos simultaneously, MI-NeRF not only reduces the total training time compared to standard single-identity NeRFs, but also demonstrates robustness in synthesizing novel expressions for any input identity. We present results for both facial expression transfer and talking face video synthesis. Our method can be further personalized for a target identity given only a short video.</description>

Abstract: In copy-move tampering operations, perpetrators often employ techniques, such as blurring, to conceal tampering traces, posing significant challenges to the detection of object-level targets with intact structures. Focus on these challenges, this paper proposes an Object-level Copy-Move Forgery Image Detection based on Inconsistency Mining (IMNet). To obtain complete object-level targets, we customize prototypes for both the source and tampered regions and dynamically update them. Additionally, we extract inconsistent regions between coarse similar regions obtained through self-correlation calculations and regions composed of prototypes. The detected inconsistent regions are used as supplements to coarse similar regions to refine pixel-level detection. We operate experiments on three public datasets which validate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed IMNet.</description>

      <title>Language Guided Domain Generalized Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single source domain generalization (SDG) holds promise for more reliable and consistent image segmentation across real-world clinical settings particularly in the medical domain, where data privacy and acquisition cost constraints often limit the availability of diverse datasets. Depending solely on visual features hampers the model's capacity to adapt effectively to various domains, primarily because of the presence of spurious correlations and domain-specific characteristics embedded within the image features. Incorporating text features alongside visual features is a potential solution to enhance the model's understanding of the data, as it goes beyond pixel-level information to provide valuable context. Textual cues describing the anatomical structures, their appearances, and variations across various imaging modalities can guide the model in domain adaptation, ultimately contributing to more robust and consistent segmentation. In this paper, we propose an approach that explicitly leverages textual information by incorporating a contrastive learning mechanism guided by the text encoder features to learn a more robust feature representation. We assess the effectiveness of our text-guided contrastive feature alignment technique in various scenarios, including cross-modality, cross-sequence, and cross-site settings for different segmentation tasks. Our approach achieves favorable performance against existing methods in literature. Our code and model weights are available at https://github.com/ShahinaKK/LG_SDG.git.</description>

      <title>MotionChain: Conversational Motion Controllers via Multimodal Prompts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated their adeptness in conducting multi-turn dialogues and retaining conversational context. However, this proficiency remains largely unexplored in other multimodal generative models, particularly in human motion models. By integrating multi-turn conversations in controlling continuous virtual human movements, generative human motion models can achieve an intuitive and step-by-step process of human task execution for humanoid robotics, game agents, or other embodied systems. In this work, we present MotionChain, a conversational human motion controller to generate continuous and long-term human motion through multimodal prompts. Specifically, MotionChain consists of multi-modal tokenizers that transform various data types such as text, image, and motion, into discrete tokens, coupled with a Vision-Motion-aware Language model. By leveraging large-scale language, vision-language, and vision-motion data to assist motion-related generation tasks, MotionChain thus comprehends each instruction in multi-turn conversation and generates human motions followed by these prompts. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of MotionChain, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in conversational motion generation, as well as more intuitive manners of controlling and interacting with virtual humans.</description>

      <title>AddSR: Accelerating Diffusion-based Blind Super-Resolution with Adversarial Diffusion Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blind super-resolution methods based on stable diffusion showcase formidable generative capabilities in reconstructing clear high-resolution images with intricate details from low-resolution inputs. However, their practical applicability is often hampered by poor efficiency, stemming from the requirement of thousands or hundreds of sampling steps. Inspired by the efficient text-to-image approach adversarial diffusion distillation (ADD), we design AddSR to address this issue by incorporating the ideas of both distillation and ControlNet. Specifically, we first propose a prediction-based self-refinement strategy to provide high-frequency information in the student model output with marginal additional time cost. Furthermore, we refine the training process by employing HR images, rather than LR images, to regulate the teacher model, providing a more robust constraint for distillation. Second, we introduce a timestep-adapting loss to address the perception-distortion imbalance problem introduced by ADD. Extensive experiments demonstrate our AddSR generates better restoration results, while achieving faster speed than previous SD-based state-of-the-art models (e.g., 7x faster than SeeSR).</description>

      <title>RAVE: Residual Vector Embedding for CLIP-Guided Backlit Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel modification of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) guidance for the task of unsupervised backlit image enhancement. Our work builds on the state-of-the-art CLIP-LIT approach, which learns a prompt pair by constraining the text-image similarity between a prompt (negative/positive sample) and a corresponding image (backlit image/well-lit image) in the CLIP embedding space. Learned prompts then guide an image enhancement network. Based on the CLIP-LIT framework, we propose two novel methods for CLIP guidance. First, we show that instead of tuning prompts in the space of text embeddings, it is possible to directly tune their embeddings in the latent space without any loss in quality. This accelerates training and potentially enables the use of additional encoders that do not have a text encoder. Second, we propose a novel approach that does not require any prompt tuning. Instead, based on CLIP embeddings of backlit and well-lit images from training data, we compute the residual vector in the embedding space as a simple difference between the mean embeddings of the well-lit and backlit images. This vector then guides the enhancement network during training, pushing a backlit image towards the space of well-lit images. This approach further dramatically reduces training time, stabilizes training and produces high quality enhanced images without artifacts, both in supervised and unsupervised training regimes. Additionally, we show that residual vectors can be interpreted, revealing biases in training data, and thereby enabling potential bias correction.</description>

Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation with lensless imaging is not only beneficial to privacy protection but also can be used in covert surveillance scenarios due to the small size and simple structure of this device. However, this task presents significant challenges due to the inherent ambiguity of the captured measurements and lacks effective methods for directly estimating human pose and shape from lensless data. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end framework to recover 3D human poses and shapes from lensless measurements to our knowledge. We specifically design a multi-scale lensless feature decoder to decode the lensless measurements through the optically encoded mask for efficient feature extraction. We also propose a double-head auxiliary supervision mechanism to improve the estimation accuracy of human limb ends. Besides, we establish a lensless imaging system and verify the effectiveness of our method on various datasets acquired by our lensless imaging system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel transfer learning framework for effective ship classification using high-resolution optical remote sensing satellite imagery. The framework is based on the deep convolutional neural network model ResNet50 and incorporates the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance performance. CBAM enables the model to attend to salient features in the images, allowing it to better discriminate between subtle differences between ships and backgrounds. Furthermore, this study adopts a transfer learning approach tailored for accurately classifying diverse types of ships by fine-tuning a pre-trained model for the specific task. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in ship classification using optical remote sensing imagery, achieving a high classification accuracy of 94% across 5 classes, outperforming existing methods. This research holds potential applications in maritime surveillance and management, illegal fishing detection, and maritime traffic monitoring.</description>

      <title>Conquering the Communication Constraints to Enable Large Pre-Trained Models in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling the collaborative training of models without centralized access to the raw data on local devices. In the typical FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg), model weights are sent to and from the server each round to participating clients. Recently, the use of small pre-trained models has been shown effective in federated learning optimization and improving convergence. However, recent state-of-the-art pre-trained models are getting more capable but also have more parameters. In conventional FL, sharing the enormous model weights can quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models are employed. Can we find a solution to enable those strong and readily-available pre-trained models in FL to achieve excellent performance while simultaneously reducing the communication burden? To this end, we investigate the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning and thus introduce a new framework: FedPEFT. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of FedPEFT across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and differential privacy settings. By only locally tuning and globally sharing a small portion of the model weights, significant reductions in the total communication overhead can be achieved while maintaining competitive or even better performance in a wide range of federated learning scenarios, providing insight into a new paradigm for practical and effective federated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we utilize the high-fidelity generation abilities of diffusion models to solve blind JPEG restoration at high compression levels. We propose an elegant modification of the forward stochastic differential equation of diffusion models to adapt them to this restoration task and name our method DriftRec. Comparing DriftRec against an $L_2$ regression baseline with the same network architecture and state-of-the-art techniques for JPEG restoration, we show that our approach can escape the tendency of other methods to generate blurry images, and recovers the distribution of clean images significantly more faithfully. For this, only a dataset of clean/corrupted image pairs and no knowledge about the corruption operation is required, enabling wider applicability to other restoration tasks. In contrast to other conditional and unconditional diffusion models, we utilize the idea that the distributions of clean and corrupted images are much closer to each other than each is to the usual Gaussian prior of the reverse process in diffusion models. Our approach therefore requires only low levels of added noise and needs comparatively few sampling steps even without further optimizations. We show that DriftRec naturally generalizes to realistic and difficult scenarios such as unaligned double JPEG compression and blind restoration of JPEGs found online, without having encountered such examples during training.</description>

      <title>RDumb: A simple approach that questions our progress in continual test-time adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) allows to update pre-trained models to changing data distributions at deployment time. While early work tested these algorithms for individual fixed distribution shifts, recent work proposed and applied methods for continual adaptation over long timescales. To examine the reported progress in the field, we propose the Continually Changing Corruptions (CCC) benchmark to measure asymptotic performance of TTA techniques. We find that eventually all but one state-of-the-art methods collapse and perform worse than a non-adapting model, including models specifically proposed to be robust to performance collapse. In addition, we introduce a simple baseline, "RDumb", that periodically resets the model to its pretrained state. RDumb performs better or on par with the previously proposed state-of-the-art in all considered benchmarks. Our results show that previous TTA approaches are neither effective at regularizing adaptation to avoid collapse nor able to outperform a simplistic resetting strategy.</description>

      <title>Learnable Weight Initialization for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09320v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid volumetric medical image segmentation models, combining the advantages of local convolution and global attention, have recently received considerable attention. While mainly focusing on architectural modifications, most existing hybrid approaches still use conventional data-independent weight initialization schemes which restrict their performance due to ignoring the inherent volumetric nature of the medical data. To address this issue, we propose a learnable weight initialization approach that utilizes the available medical training data to effectively learn the contextual and structural cues via the proposed self-supervised objectives. Our approach is easy to integrate into any hybrid model and requires no external training data. Experiments on multi-organ and lung cancer segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our proposed data-dependent initialization approach performs favorably as compared to the Swin-UNETR model pretrained using large-scale datasets on multi-organ segmentation task. Our source code and models are available at: https://github.com/ShahinaKK/LWI-VMS.</description>

Abstract: Optical computing systems provide high-speed and low-energy data processing but face deficiencies in computationally demanding training and simulation-to-reality gaps. We propose a gradient-based model-free optimization (G-MFO) method based on a Monte Carlo gradient estimation algorithm for computationally efficient in situ training of optical computing systems. This approach treats an optical computing system as a black box and back-propagates the loss directly to the optical computing weights' probability distributions, circumventing the need for a computationally heavy and biased system simulation. Our experiments on diffractive optical computing systems show that G-MFO outperforms hybrid training on the MNIST and FMNIST datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate image-free and high-speed classification of cells from their marker-free phase maps. Our method's model-free and high-performance nature, combined with its low demand for computational resources, paves the way for accelerating the transition of optical computing from laboratory demonstrations to practical, real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Computational limits to the legibility of the imaged human brain</title>

Abstract: Our knowledge of the organisation of the human brain at the population-level is yet to translate into power to predict functional differences at the individual-level, limiting clinical applications, and casting doubt on the generalisability of inferred mechanisms. It remains unknown whether the difficulty arises from the absence of individuating biological patterns within the brain, or from limited power to access them with the models and compute at our disposal. Here we comprehensively investigate the resolvability of such patterns with data and compute at unprecedented scale. Across 23 810 unique participants from UK Biobank, we systematically evaluate the predictability of 25 individual biological characteristics, from all available combinations of structural and functional neuroimaging data. Over 4526 GPU hours of computation, we train, optimize, and evaluate out-of-sample 700 individual predictive models, including fully-connected feed-forward neural networks of demographic, psychological, serological, chronic disease, and functional connectivity characteristics, and both uni- and multi-modal 3D convolutional neural network models of macro- and micro-structural brain imaging. We find a marked discrepancy between the high predictability of sex (balanced accuracy 99.7%), age (mean absolute error 2.048 years, R2 0.859), and weight (mean absolute error 2.609Kg, R2 0.625), for which we set new state-of-the-art performance, and the surprisingly low predictability of other characteristics. Neither structural nor functional imaging predicted psychology better than the coincidence of chronic disease (p&lt;0.05). Serology predicted chronic disease (p&lt;0.05) and was best predicted by it (p&lt;0.001), followed by structural neuroimaging (p&lt;0.05). Our findings suggest either more informative imaging or more powerful models are needed to decipher individual level characteristics from the human brain.</description>

      <title>eWand: A calibration framework for wide baseline frame-based and event-based camera systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate calibration is crucial for using multiple cameras to triangulate the position of objects precisely. However, it is also a time-consuming process that needs to be repeated for every displacement of the cameras. The standard approach is to use a printed pattern with known geometry to estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the cameras. The same idea can be applied to event-based cameras, though it requires extra work. By using frame reconstruction from events, a printed pattern can be detected. A blinking pattern can also be displayed on a screen. Then, the pattern can be directly detected from the events. Such calibration methods can provide accurate intrinsic calibration for both frame- and event-based cameras. However, using 2D patterns has several limitations for multi-camera extrinsic calibration, with cameras possessing highly different points of view and a wide baseline. The 2D pattern can only be detected from one direction and needs to be of significant size to compensate for its distance to the camera. This makes the extrinsic calibration time-consuming and cumbersome. To overcome these limitations, we propose eWand, a new method that uses blinking LEDs inside opaque spheres instead of a printed or displayed pattern. Our method provides a faster, easier-to-use extrinsic calibration approach that maintains high accuracy for both event- and frame-based cameras.</description>

      <title>CV-Attention UNet: Attention-based UNet for 3D Cerebrovascular Segmentation of Enhanced TOF-MRA Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10224</link>

Abstract: Due to the lack of automated methods, to diagnose cerebrovascular disease, time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) is assessed visually, making it time-consuming. The commonly used encoder-decoder architectures for cerebrovascular segmentation utilize redundant features, eventually leading to the extraction of low-level features multiple times. Additionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from performance degradation when the batch size is small, and deeper networks experience the vanishing gradient problem. Methods: In this paper, we attempt to solve these limitations and propose the 3D cerebrovascular attention UNet method, named CV-AttentionUNet, for precise extraction of brain vessel images. We proposed a sequence of preprocessing techniques followed by deeply supervised UNet to improve the accuracy of segmentation of the brain vessels leading to a stroke. To combine the low and high semantics, we applied the attention mechanism. This mechanism focuses on relevant associations and neglects irrelevant anatomical information. Furthermore, the inclusion of deep supervision incorporates different levels of features that prove to be beneficial for network convergence. Results: We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method by cross-validating with an unlabeled dataset, which was further labeled by us. We believe that the novelty of this algorithm lies in its ability to perform well on both labeled and unlabeled data with image processing-based enhancement. The results indicate that our method performed better than the existing state-of-the-art methods on the TubeTK dataset. Conclusion: The proposed method will help in accurate segmentation of cerebrovascular structure leading to stroke</description>

      <title>ReCoRe: Regularized Contrastive Representation Learning of World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have demonstrated human-level effectiveness in gaming environments, their success in everyday tasks like visual navigation has been limited, particularly under significant appearance variations. This limitation arises from (i) poor sample efficiency and (ii) over-fitting to training scenarios. To address these challenges, we present a world model that learns invariant features using (i) contrastive unsupervised learning and (ii) an intervention-invariant regularizer. Learning an explicit representation of the world dynamics i.e. a world model, improves sample efficiency while contrastive learning implicitly enforces learning of invariant features, which improves generalization. However, the na\"ive integration of contrastive loss to world models is not good enough, as world-model-based RL methods independently optimize representation learning and agent policy. To overcome this issue, we propose an intervention-invariant regularizer in the form of an auxiliary task such as depth prediction, image denoising, image segmentation, etc., that explicitly enforces invariance to style interventions. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL methods and significantly improves on out-of-distribution point navigation tasks evaluated on the iGibson benchmark. With only visual observations, we further demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent language-guided foundation models for point navigation, which is essential for deployment on robots with limited computation capabilities. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model excels at the sim-to-real transfer of its perception module on the Gibson benchmark.</description>

      <title>Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases. We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud Vertex AI.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Benchmark in Medical Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent success of large language and vision models (LLVMs) on vision question answering (VQA), particularly their applications in medicine (Med-VQA), has shown a great potential of realizing effective visual assistants for healthcare. However, these models are not extensively tested on the hallucination phenomenon in clinical settings. Here, we created a hallucination benchmark of medical images paired with question-answer sets and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art models. The study provides an in-depth analysis of current models' limitations and reveals the effectiveness of various prompting strategies.</description>

      <title>RRWNet: Recursive Refinement Network for Effective Retinal Artery/Vein Segmentation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The caliber and configuration of retinal blood vessels serve as important biomarkers for various diseases and medical conditions. A thorough analysis of the retinal vasculature requires the segmentation of the blood vessels and their classification into arteries and veins, typically performed on color fundus images obtained by retinography. However, manually performing these tasks is labor-intensive and prone to human error. While several automated methods have been proposed to address this task, the current state of art faces challenges due to manifest classification errors affecting the topological consistency of segmentation maps. In this work, we introduce RRWNet, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that addresses this limitation. The framework consists of a fully convolutional neural network that recursively refines semantic segmentation maps, correcting manifest classification errors and thus improving topological consistency. In particular, RRWNet is composed of two specialized subnetworks: a Base subnetwork that generates base segmentation maps from the input images, and a Recursive Refinement subnetwork that iteratively and recursively improves these maps. Evaluation on three different public datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method, yielding more topologically consistent segmentation maps with fewer manifest classification errors than existing approaches. In addition, the Recursive Refinement module within RRWNet proves effective in post-processing segmentation maps from other methods, further demonstrating its potential. The model code, weights, and predictions will be publicly available at https://github.com/j-morano/rrwnet.</description>

      <title>CFIR: Fast and Effective Long-Text To Image Retrieval for Large Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval aims to find the relevant images based on a text query, which is important in various use-cases, such as digital libraries, e-commerce, and multimedia databases. Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, they exhibit limitations in handling large-scale, diverse, and ambiguous real-world needs of retrieval, due to the computation cost and the injective embeddings they produce. This paper presents a two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Index-shared Retrieval (CFIR) framework, designed for fast and effective large-scale long-text to image retrieval. The first stage, Entity-based Ranking (ER), adapts to long-text query ambiguity by employing a multiple-queries-to-multiple-targets paradigm, facilitating candidate filtering for the next stage. The second stage, Summary-based Re-ranking (SR), refines these rankings using summarized queries. We also propose a specialized Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder, optimized for handling ambiguous user needs and both stages, which also enhances computational efficiency through vector-based similarity inference. Evaluation on the AToMiC dataset reveals that CFIR surpasses existing MLLMs by up to 11.06% in Recall@1000, while reducing training and retrieval times by 68.75% and 99.79%, respectively. We will release our code to facilitate future research at https://github.com/longkukuhi/CFIR.</description>

      <title>Strengthening Multimodal Large Language Model with Bootstrapped Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in generating responses based on visual inputs. However, they often suffer from a bias towards generating responses similar to their pretraining corpus, overshadowing the importance of visual information. We treat this bias as a "preference" for pretraining statistics, which hinders the model's grounding in visual input. To mitigate this issue, we propose Bootstrapped Preference Optimization (BPO), which conducts preference learning with datasets containing negative responses bootstrapped from the model itself. Specifically, we propose the following two strategies: 1) using distorted image inputs to the MLLM for eliciting responses that contain signified pretraining bias; 2) leveraging text-based LLM to explicitly inject erroneous but common elements into the original response. Those undesirable responses are paired with original annotated responses from the datasets to construct the preference dataset, which is subsequently utilized to perform preference learning. Our approach effectively suppresses pretrained LLM bias, enabling enhanced grounding in visual inputs. Extensive experimentation demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal conversational systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying and Mitigating Unimodal Biases in Multimodal Large Language Models: A Causal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have facilitated the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Despite their impressive capabilities, MLLMs often suffer from an over-reliance on unimodal biases (e.g., language bias and vision bias), leading to incorrect answers in complex multimodal tasks. To investigate this issue, we propose a causal framework to interpret the biases in Visual Question Answering (VQA) problems. Within our framework, we devise a causal graph to elucidate the predictions of MLLMs on VQA problems, and assess the causal effect of biases through an in-depth causal analysis. Motivated by the causal graph, we introduce a novel MORE dataset, consisting of 12,000 VQA instances. This dataset is designed to challenge MLLMs' abilities, necessitating multi-hop reasoning and the surmounting of unimodal biases. Furthermore, we propose two strategies to mitigate unimodal biases and enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities, including a Decompose-Verify-Answer (DeVA) framework for limited-access MLLMs and the refinement of open-source MLLMs through fine-tuning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments offer valuable insights for future research. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/MORE.</description>

      <title>A Robust Ensemble Algorithm for Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation: Generalizability and Clinical Utility Beyond the ISLES Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is essential for stroke diagnosis, treatment decisions, and prognosis. However, image and disease variability hinder the development of generalizable AI algorithms with clinical value. We address this gap by presenting a novel ensemble algorithm derived from the 2022 Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge. ISLES'22 provided 400 patient scans with ischemic stroke from various medical centers, facilitating the development of a wide range of cutting-edge segmentation algorithms by the research community. Through collaboration with leading teams, we combined top-performing algorithms into an ensemble model that overcomes the limitations of individual solutions. Our ensemble model achieved superior ischemic lesion detection and segmentation accuracy on our internal test set compared to individual algorithms. This accuracy generalized well across diverse image and disease variables. Furthermore, the model excelled in extracting clinical biomarkers. Notably, in a Turing-like test, neuroradiologists consistently preferred the algorithm's segmentations over manual expert efforts, highlighting increased comprehensiveness and precision. Validation using a real-world external dataset (N=1686) confirmed the model's generalizability. The algorithm's outputs also demonstrated strong correlations with clinical scores (admission NIHSS and 90-day mRS) on par with or exceeding expert-derived results, underlining its clinical relevance. This study offers two key findings. First, we present an ensemble algorithm (https://github.com/Tabrisrei/ISLES22_Ensemble) that detects and segments ischemic stroke lesions on DWI across diverse scenarios on par with expert (neuro)radiologists. Second, we show the potential for biomedical challenge outputs to extend beyond the challenge's initial objectives, demonstrating their real-world clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>InfLoRA: Interference-Free Low-Rank Adaptation for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning requires the model to learn multiple tasks sequentially. In continual learning, the model should possess the ability to maintain its performance on old tasks (stability) and the ability to adapt to new tasks continuously (plasticity). Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which involves freezing a pre-trained model and injecting a small number of learnable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks, has gained increasing popularity in continual learning. Although existing continual learning methods based on PEFT have demonstrated superior performance compared to those not based on PEFT, most of them do not consider how to eliminate the interference of the new task on the old tasks, which inhibits the model from making a good trade-off between stability and plasticity. In this work, we propose a new PEFT method, called interference-free low-rank adaptation (InfLoRA), for continual learning. InfLoRA injects a small number of parameters to reparameterize the pre-trained weights and shows that fine-tuning these injected parameters is equivalent to fine-tuning the pre-trained weights within a subspace. Furthermore, InfLoRA designs this subspace to eliminate the interference of the new task on the old tasks, making a good trade-off between stability and plasticity. Experimental results show that InfLoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art continual learning methods on multiple datasets.</description>
