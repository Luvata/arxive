      <title>An Assessment of Model-On-Model Deception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trustworthiness of highly capable language models is put at risk when they are able to produce deceptive outputs. Moreover, when models are vulnerable to deception it undermines reliability. In this paper, we introduce a method to investigate complex, model-on-model deceptive scenarios. We create a dataset of over 10,000 misleading explanations by asking Llama-2 7B, 13B, 70B, and GPT-3.5 to justify the wrong answer for questions in the MMLU. We find that, when models read these explanations, they are all significantly deceived. Worryingly, models of all capabilities are successful at misleading others, while more capable models are only slightly better at resisting deception. We recommend the development of techniques to detect and defend against deception.</description>

      <title>RAGE Against the Machine: Retrieval-Augmented LLM Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates RAGE, an interactive tool for explaining Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval capabilities; i.e., able to query external sources and pull relevant information into their input context. Our explanations are counterfactual in the sense that they identify parts of the input context that, when removed, change the answer to the question posed to the LLM. RAGE includes pruning methods to navigate the vast space of possible explanations, allowing users to view the provenance of the produced answers.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Education: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has a profound impact on traditional education. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in various applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, and autonomous driving. LLMs have also been applied in many fields, including recommendation, finance, government, education, legal affairs, and finance. As powerful auxiliary tools, LLMs incorporate various technologies such as deep learning, pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. The use of LLMs for smart education (LLMEdu) has been a significant strategic direction for countries worldwide. While LLMs have shown great promise in improving teaching quality, changing education models, and modifying teacher roles, the technologies are still facing several challenges. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of LLMEdu, focusing on current technologies, challenges, and future developments. We first summarize the current state of LLMEdu and then introduce the characteristics of LLMs and education, as well as the benefits of integrating LLMs into education. We also review the process of integrating LLMs into the education industry, as well as the introduction of related technologies. Finally, we discuss the challenges and problems faced by LLMEdu, as well as prospects for future optimization of LLMEdu.</description>

      <title>DuetRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods augment the input of Large Language Models (LLMs) with relevant retrieved passages, reducing factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, contemporary RAG approaches suffer from irrelevant knowledge retrieval issues in complex domain questions (e.g., HotPot QA) due to the lack of corresponding domain knowledge, leading to low-quality generations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, DuetRAG. Our bootstrapping philosophy is to simultaneously integrate the domain fintuning and RAG models to improve the knowledge retrieval quality, thereby enhancing generation quality. Finally, we demonstrate DuetRAG' s matches with expert human researchers on HotPot QA.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Recent Advances in Conversational Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in conversational systems have significantly enhanced human-machine interactions across various domains. However, training these systems is challenging due to the scarcity of specialized dialogue data. Traditionally, conversational datasets were created through crowdsourcing, but this method has proven costly, limited in scale, and labor-intensive. As a solution, the development of synthetic dialogue data has emerged, utilizing techniques to augment existing datasets or convert textual resources into conversational formats, providing a more efficient and scalable approach to dataset creation. In this survey, we offer a systematic and comprehensive review of multi-turn conversational data generation, focusing on three types of dialogue systems: open domain, task-oriented, and information-seeking. We categorize the existing research based on key components like seed data creation, utterance generation, and quality filtering methods, and introduce a general framework that outlines the main principles of conversation data generation systems. Additionally, we examine the evaluation metrics and methods for assessing synthetic conversational data, address current challenges in the field, and explore potential directions for future research. Our goal is to accelerate progress for researchers and practitioners by presenting an overview of state-of-the-art methods and highlighting opportunities to further research in this area.</description>

      <title>MathDivide: Improved mathematical reasoning by large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have been proven to be capable of handling complex linguistic and cognitive tasks. Therefore their usage has been extended to tasks requiring logical reasoning ability such as Mathematics. In this paper, we propose a prompting technique called MathDivide that breaks down the mathematical problem into simpler subproblems. Each of the subproblems is formulated as an algebraic expression whose value is evaluated by the Python code generated by the LLM for the corresponding algebraic expression. The values fed to the Python code are the numerical values provided in the problem statement. The solutions for the subproblems are composed together to obtain the final answer for the problem statement. Finally, the final answer is compared to the correct answer. If the final answer matches the correct answer, it is produced as output else a refinement prompt is fed to the LLM. We experiment with this prompting technique on both closed-source LLM models and open-source LLM models using GSM8K dataset. The results obtained demonstrate that MathDivide was able to significantly outperform the leading prompting technique called Math-prompter.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Rare Inflammatory Disease Using Large Language Models and Social Media Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sarcoidosis is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in various organs. The disease presents diagnostic and treatment challenges due to its diverse manifestations and unpredictable nature. In this study, we employed a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze sarcoidosis-related discussions on the social media platform Reddit. Our findings underscore the efficacy of LLMs in accurately identifying sarcoidosis-related content. We discovered a wide array of symptoms reported by patients, with fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and shortness of breath as the most prevalent. Prednisone was the most prescribed medication, while infliximab showed the highest effectiveness in improving prognoses. Notably, our analysis revealed disparities in prognosis based on age and gender, with women and younger patients experiencing good and polarized outcomes, respectively. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering identified three distinct patient subgroups (phenotypes) with unique symptom profiles, prognostic outcomes, and demographic distributions. Finally, sentiment analysis revealed a moderate negative impact on patients' mental health post-diagnosis, particularly among women and younger individuals. Our study represents the first application of LLMs to understand sarcoidosis through social media data. It contributes to understanding the disease by providing data-driven insights into its manifestations, treatments, prognoses, and impact on patients' lives. Our findings have direct implications for improving personalized treatment strategies and enhancing the quality of care for individuals living with sarcoidosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FAQ documents are commonly used with text documents and websites to provide important information in the form of question answer pairs to either aid in reading comprehension or provide a shortcut to the key ideas. We suppose that salient sentences from a given document serve as a good proxy fro the answers to an aggregated set of FAQs from readers. We propose a system for generating FAQ documents that extract the salient questions and their corresponding answers from sizeable text documents scraped from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. We use existing text summarization, sentence ranking via the Text rank algorithm, and question-generation tools to create an initial set of questions and answers. Finally, we apply some heuristics to filter out invalid questions. We use human evaluation to rate the generated questions on grammar, whether the question is meaningful, and whether the question's answerability is present within a summarized context. On average, participants thought 71 percent of the questions were meaningful.</description>

      <title>News Recommendation with Category Description by a Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized news recommendations are essential for online news platforms to assist users in discovering news articles that match their interests from a vast amount of online content. Appropriately encoded content features, such as text, categories, and images, are essential for recommendations. Among these features, news categories, such as tv-golden-globe, finance-real-estate, and news-politics, play an important role in understanding news content, inspiring us to enhance the categories' descriptions. In this paper, we propose a novel method that automatically generates informative category descriptions using a large language model (LLM) without manual effort or domain-specific knowledge and incorporates them into recommendation models as additional information. In our comprehensive experimental evaluations using the MIND dataset, our method successfully achieved 5.8% improvement at most in AUC compared with baseline approaches without the LLM's generated category descriptions for the state-of-the-art content-based recommendation models including NAML, NRMS, and NPA. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/yamanalab/gpt-augmented-news-recommendation.</description>

      <title>Control Token with Dense Passage Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the hallucination problem in large language models (LLMs). We adopted Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020), a technique that involves embedding relevant information in the prompt to obtain accurate answers. However, RAG also faced inherent issues in retrieving correct information. To address this, we employed the Dense Passage Retrieval(DPR) (Karpukhin et al., 2020) model for fetching domain-specific documents related to user queries. Despite this, the DPR model still lacked accuracy in document retrieval. We enhanced the DPR model by incorporating control tokens, achieving significantly superior performance over the standard DPR model, with a 13% improvement in Top-1 accuracy and a 4% improvement in Top-20 accuracy.</description>

      <title>METAREFLECTION: Learning Instructions for Language Agents using Past Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), crafting specific prompts for LLMs to perform particular tasks remains challenging. Users often engage in multiple conversational turns with an LLM-based agent to accomplish their intended task. Recent studies have demonstrated that linguistic feedback, in the form of self-reflections generated by the model, can work as reinforcement during these conversations, thus enabling quicker convergence to the desired outcome. Motivated by these findings, we introduce METAREFLECTION, a novel technique that learns general prompt instructions for a specific domain from individual self-reflections gathered during a training phase. We evaluate our technique in two domains: Infrastructure as Code (IAC) vulnerability detection and question-answering (QA) using REACT and COT. Our results demonstrate a notable improvement, with METARELECTION outperforming GPT-4 by 16.82% (IAC), 31.33% (COT), and 15.42% (REACT), underscoring the potential of METAREFLECTION as a viable method for enhancing the efficiency of LLMs.</description>

      <title>UCCIX: Irish-eXcellence Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has predominantly focused on high-resource languages, leaving extremely low-resource languages like Irish with limited representation. This work presents UCCIX, a pioneering effort on the development of an open-source Irish-based LLM. We propose a novel framework for continued pre-training of LLMs specifically adapted for extremely low-resource languages, requiring only a fraction of the textual data typically needed for training LLMs according to scaling laws. Our model, based on Llama 2-13B, outperforms much larger models on Irish language tasks with up to 12% performance improvement, showcasing the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We also contribute comprehensive Irish benchmarking datasets, including IrishQA, a question-answering dataset, and Irish version of MT-bench. These datasets enable rigorous evaluation and facilitate future research in Irish LLM systems. Our work aims to preserve and promote the Irish language, knowledge, and culture of Ireland in the digital era while providing a framework for adapting LLMs to other indigenous languages.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Social Media Comments with a Novel Named Entity Recognition System for Identity Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While civilized users employ social media to stay informed and discuss daily occurrences, haters perceive these platforms as fertile ground for attacking groups and individuals. The prevailing approach to counter this phenomenon involves detecting such attacks by identifying toxic language. Effective platform measures aim to report haters and block their network access. In this context, employing hate speech detection methods aids in identifying these attacks amidst vast volumes of text, which are impossible for humans to analyze manually. In our study, we expand upon the usual hate speech detection methods, typically based on text classifiers, to develop a Named Entity Recognition (NER) System for Identity Groups. To achieve this, we created a dataset that allows extending a conventional NER to recognize identity groups. Consequently, our tool not only detects whether a sentence contains an attack but also tags the sentence tokens corresponding to the mentioned group. Results indicate that the model performs competitively in identifying groups with an average f1-score of 0.75, outperforming in identifying ethnicity attack spans with an f1-score of 0.80 compared to other identity groups. Moreover, the tool shows an outstanding generalization capability to minority classes concerning sexual orientation and gender, achieving an f1-score of 0.77 and 0.72, respectively. We tested the utility of our tool in a case study on social media, annotating and comparing comments from Facebook related to news mentioning identity groups. The case study reveals differences in the types of attacks recorded, effectively detecting named entities related to the categories of the analyzed news articles. Entities are accurately tagged within their categories, with a negligible error rate for inter-category tagging.</description>

      <title>Divergent Creativity in Humans and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent surge in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to claims that they are approaching a level of creativity akin to human capabilities. This idea has sparked a blend of excitement and apprehension. However, a critical piece that has been missing in this discourse is a systematic evaluation of LLM creativity, particularly in comparison to human divergent thinking. To bridge this gap, we leverage recent advances in creativity science to build a framework for in-depth analysis of divergent creativity in both state-of-the-art LLMs and a substantial dataset of 100,000 humans. We found evidence suggesting that LLMs can indeed surpass human capabilities in specific creative tasks such as divergent association and creative writing. Our quantitative benchmarking framework opens up new paths for the development of more creative LLMs, but it also encourages more granular inquiries into the distinctive elements that constitute human inventive thought processes, compared to those that can be artificially generated.</description>

      <title>Amplifying Aspect-Sentence Awareness: A Novel Approach for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is increasingly crucial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for applications such as customer feedback analysis and product recommendation systems. ABSA goes beyond traditional sentiment analysis by extracting sentiments related to specific aspects mentioned in the text; existing attention-based models often need help to effectively connect aspects with context due to language complexity and multiple sentiment polarities in a single sentence. Recent research underscores the value of integrating syntactic information, such as dependency trees, to understand long-range syntactic relationships better and link aspects with context. Despite these advantages, challenges persist, including sensitivity to parsing errors and increased computational complexity when combining syntactic and semantic information. To address these issues, we propose Amplifying Aspect-Sentence Awareness (A3SN), a novel technique designed to enhance ABSA through amplifying aspect-sentence awareness attention. Following the transformer's standard process, our innovative approach incorporates multi-head attention mechanisms to augment the model with sentence and aspect semantic information. We added another multi-head attention module: amplify aspect-sentence awareness attention. By doubling its focus between the sentence and aspect, we effectively highlighted aspect importance within the sentence context. This enables accurate capture of subtle relationships and dependencies. Additionally, gated fusion integrates feature representations from multi-head and amplified aspect-sentence awareness attention mechanisms, which is essential for ABSA. Experimental results across three benchmark datasets demonstrate A3SN's effectiveness and outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline models.</description>

To address these challenges, recent research has focused on using smaller task-specific language models, which are enhanced by distilling the knowledge rationales generated by LLMs. However, previous works mostly emphasize the effectiveness of positive knowledge, while overlooking the knowledge noise and the exploration of negative knowledge. In this paper, we first propose a general approach called quality-guided contrastive rationale distillation for reasoning capacity learning, considering contrastive learning perspectives. For the learning of positive knowledge, we collect positive rationales through self-consistency to denoise the LLM rationales generated by temperature sampling. For the negative knowledge distillation, we generate negative rationales using temperature sampling for the iteration-before smaller language models themselves. Finally, a contrastive loss is designed to better distill the positive and negative rationales into the smaller language model, where an online-update discriminator is used to judge the qualities of rationales and assign weights for better optimizing the training process. Through extensive experiments on multiple reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the previous distillation methods and produces higher-quality rationales.</description>

      <title>Assisted Debate Builder with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ADBL2, an assisted debate builder tool. It is based on the capability of large language models to generalise and perform relation-based argument mining in a wide-variety of domains. It is the first open-source tool that leverages relation-based mining for (1) the verification of pre-established relations in a debate and (2) the assisted creation of new arguments by means of large language models. ADBL2 is highly modular and can work with any open-source large language models that are used as plugins. As a by-product, we also provide the first fine-tuned Mistral-7B large language model for relation-based argument mining, usable by ADBL2, which outperforms existing approaches for this task with an overall F1-score of 90.59% across all domains.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Darija Open Dataset: Introducing Version 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Darija Open Dataset (DODa) represents an open-source project aimed at enhancing Natural Language Processing capabilities for the Moroccan dialect, Darija. With approximately 100,000 entries, DODa stands as the largest collaborative project of its kind for Darija-English translation. The dataset features semantic and syntactic categorizations, variations in spelling, verb conjugations across multiple tenses, as well as tens of thousands of translated sentences. The dataset includes entries written in both Latin and Arabic alphabets, reflecting the linguistic variations and preferences found in different sources and applications. The availability of such dataset is critical for developing applications that can accurately understand and generate Darija, thus supporting the linguistic needs of the Moroccan community and potentially extending to similar dialects in neighboring regions. This paper explores the strategic importance of DODa, its current achievements, and the envisioned future enhancements that will continue to promote its use and expansion in the global NLP landscape.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Analysis on the Temporal Generalization of Language Models in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In machine learning, temporal shifts occur when there are differences between training and test splits in terms of time. For streaming data such as news or social media, models are commonly trained on a fixed corpus from a certain period of time, and they can become obsolete due to the dynamism and evolving nature of online content. This paper focuses on temporal shifts in social media and, in particular, Twitter. We propose a unified evaluation scheme to assess the performance of language models (LMs) under temporal shift on standard social media tasks. LMs are tested on five diverse social media NLP tasks under different temporal settings, which revealed two important findings: (i) the decrease in performance under temporal shift is consistent across different models for entity-focused tasks such as named entity recognition or disambiguation, and hate speech detection, but not significant in the other tasks analysed (i.e., topic and sentiment classification); and (ii) continuous pre-training on the test period does not improve the temporal adaptability of LMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that are robust and resilient to classroom conditions is paramount to the development of AI tools to aid teachers and students. In this work, we study the efficacy of continued pretraining (CPT) in adapting Wav2vec2.0 to the classroom domain. We show that CPT is a powerful tool in that regard and reduces the Word Error Rate (WER) of Wav2vec2.0-based models by upwards of 10%. More specifically, CPT improves the model's robustness to different noises, microphones, classroom conditions as well as classroom demographics. Our CPT models show improved ability to generalize to different demographics unseen in the labeled finetuning data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the crucial importance of accelerating text generation in large language models (LLMs) for efficiently producing content, the sequential nature of this process often leads to high inference latency, posing challenges for real-time applications. Various techniques have been proposed and developed to address these challenges and improve efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of accelerated generation techniques in autoregressive language models, aiming to understand the state-of-the-art methods and their applications. We categorize these techniques into several key areas: speculative decoding, early exiting mechanisms, and non-autoregressive methods. We discuss each category's underlying principles, advantages, limitations, and recent advancements. Through this survey, we aim to offer insights into the current landscape of techniques in LLMs and provide guidance for future research directions in this critical area of natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Using Combinatorial Optimization to Design a High quality LLM Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel LLM based solution design approach that utilizes combinatorial optimization and sampling. Specifically, a set of factors that influence the quality of the solution are identified. They typically include factors that represent prompt types, LLM inputs alternatives, and parameters governing the generation and design alternatives. Identifying the factors that govern the LLM solution quality enables the infusion of subject matter expert knowledge. Next, a set of interactions between the factors are defined and combinatorial optimization is used to create a small subset $P$ that ensures all desired interactions occur in $P$. Each element $p \in P$ is then developed into an appropriate benchmark. Applying the alternative solutions on each combination, $p \in P$ and evaluating the results facilitate the design of a high quality LLM solution pipeline. The approach is especially applicable when the design and evaluation of each benchmark in $P$ is time-consuming and involves manual steps and human evaluation. Given its efficiency the approach can also be used as a baseline to compare and validate an autoML approach that searches over the factors governing the solution.</description>

      <title>IM-RAG: Multi-Round Retrieval-Augmented Generation Through Learning Inner Monologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms can use external knowledge to enhance and ground the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate generative hallucinations and static knowledge base problems, they still suffer from limited flexibility in adopting Information Retrieval (IR) systems with varying capabilities, constrained interpretability during the multi-round retrieval process, and a lack of end-to-end optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-centric approach, IM-RAG, that integrates IR systems with LLMs to support multi-round RAG through learning Inner Monologues (IM, i.e., the human inner voice that narrates one's thoughts). During the IM process, the LLM serves as the core reasoning model (i.e., Reasoner) to either propose queries to collect more information via the Retriever or to provide a final answer based on the conversational context. We also introduce a Refiner that improves the outputs from the Retriever, effectively bridging the gap between the Reasoner and IR modules with varying capabilities and fostering multi-round communications. The entire IM process is optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL) where a Progress Tracker is incorporated to provide mid-step rewards, and the answer prediction is further separately optimized via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We conduct extensive experiments with the HotPotQA dataset, a popular benchmark for retrieval-based, multi-step question-answering. The results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while providing high flexibility in integrating IR modules as well as strong interpretability exhibited in the learned inner monologues.</description>

      <title>LLMs can learn self-restraint through iterative self-reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to be deployed safely, Large Language Models (LLMs) must be capable of dynamically adapting their behavior based on their level of knowledge and uncertainty associated with specific topics. This adaptive behavior, which we refer to as self-restraint, is non-trivial to teach since it depends on the internal knowledge of an LLM. By default, LLMs are trained to maximize the next token likelihood, which does not teach the model to modulate its answer based on its level of uncertainty. In order to learn self-restraint, we devise a utility function that can encourage the model to produce responses only when it is confident in them. This utility function can be used to score generation of different length and abstention. To optimize this function, we introduce ReSearch, a process of ``self-reflection'' consisting of iterative self-prompting and self-evaluation. We use the ReSearch algorithm to generate synthetic data on which we finetune our models. Compared to their original versions, our resulting models generate fewer \emph{hallucinations} overall at no additional inference cost, for both known and unknown topics, as the model learns to selectively restrain itself. In addition, our method elegantly incorporates the ability to abstain by augmenting the samples generated by the model during the search procedure with an answer expressing abstention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey explores the fairness of large language models (LLMs) in e-commerce, examining their progress, applications, and the challenges they face. LLMs have become pivotal in the e-commerce domain, offering innovative solutions and enhancing customer experiences. This work presents a comprehensive survey on the applications and challenges of LLMs in e-commerce. The paper begins by introducing the key principles underlying the use of LLMs in e-commerce, detailing the processes of pretraining, fine-tuning, and prompting that tailor these models to specific needs. It then explores the varied applications of LLMs in e-commerce, including product reviews, where they synthesize and analyze customer feedback; product recommendations, where they leverage consumer data to suggest relevant items; product information translation, enhancing global accessibility; and product question and answer sections, where they automate customer support. The paper critically addresses the fairness challenges in e-commerce, highlighting how biases in training data and algorithms can lead to unfair outcomes, such as reinforcing stereotypes or discriminating against certain groups. These issues not only undermine consumer trust, but also raise ethical and legal concerns. Finally, the work outlines future research directions, emphasizing the need for more equitable and transparent LLMs in e-commerce. It advocates for ongoing efforts to mitigate biases and improve the fairness of these systems, ensuring they serve diverse global markets effectively and ethically. Through this comprehensive analysis, the survey provides a holistic view of the current landscape of LLMs in e-commerce, offering insights into their potential and limitations, and guiding future endeavors in creating fairer and more inclusive e-commerce environments.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Human Revisions for Improving Text-to-Layout Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from human feedback has shown success in aligning large, pretrained models with human values. Prior works have mostly focused on learning from high-level labels, such as preferences between pairs of model outputs. On the other hand, many domains could benefit from more involved, detailed feedback, such as revisions, explanations, and reasoning of human users. Our work proposes using nuanced feedback through the form of human revisions for stronger alignment. In this paper, we ask expert designers to fix layouts generated from a generative layout model that is pretrained on a large-scale dataset of mobile screens. Then, we train a reward model based on how human designers revise these generated layouts. With the learned reward model, we optimize our model with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Our method, Revision-Aware Reward Models ($\method$), allows a generative text-to-layout model to produce more modern, designer-aligned layouts, showing the potential for utilizing human revisions and stronger forms of feedback in improving generative models.</description>

      <title>DuetSim: Building User Simulator with Dual Large Language Models for Task-Oriented Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User Simulators play a pivotal role in training and evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems. Traditional user simulators typically rely on human-engineered agendas, resulting in generated responses that often lack diversity and spontaneity. Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity for generating coherent and contextually appropriate utterances, they may fall short when tasked with generating responses that effectively guide users towards their goals, particularly in dialogues with intricate constraints and requirements. This paper introduces DuetSim, a novel framework designed to address the intricate demands of task-oriented dialogues by leveraging LLMs. DuetSim stands apart from conventional approaches by employing two LLMs in tandem: one dedicated to response generation and the other focused on verification. This dual LLM approach empowers DuetSim to produce responses that not only exhibit diversity but also demonstrate accuracy and are preferred by human users. We validate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments conducted on the MultiWOZ dataset, highlighting improvements in response quality and correctness, largely attributed to the incorporation of the second LLM. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/suntea233/DuetSim.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing with Enhanced Data Quality Assurance: An Efficient Approach to Mitigate Resource Scarcity Challenges in Training Large Language Models for Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential in artificial intelligence across various domains, including healthcare. However, their efficacy is hindered by the need for high-quality labeled data, which is often expensive and time-consuming to create, particularly in low-resource domains like healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose a crowdsourcing (CS) framework enriched with quality control measures at the pre-, real-time-, and post-data gathering stages. Our study evaluated the effectiveness of enhancing data quality through its impact on LLMs (Bio-BERT) for predicting autism-related symptoms. The results show that real-time quality control improves data quality by 19 percent compared to pre-quality control. Fine-tuning Bio-BERT using crowdsourced data generally increased recall compared to the Bio-BERT baseline but lowered precision. Our findings highlighted the potential of crowdsourcing and quality control in resource-constrained environments and offered insights into optimizing healthcare LLMs for informed decision-making and improved patient care.</description>

      <title>A Robust Autoencoder Ensemble-Based Approach for Anomaly Detection in Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a robust autoencoder ensemble-based approach designed to address anomaly detection in text corpora is introduced. Each autoencoder within the ensemble incorporates a local robust subspace recovery projection of the original data in its encoding embedding, leveraging the geometric properties of the k-nearest neighbors to optimize subspace recovery and identify anomalous patterns in textual data. The evaluation of such an approach needs an experimental setting dedicated to the context of textual anomaly detection. Thus, beforehand, a comprehensive real-world taxonomy is introduced to distinguish between independent anomalies and contextual anomalies. Such a study to identify clearly the kinds of anomalies appearing in a textual context aims at addressing a critical gap in the existing literature. Then, extensive experiments on classical text corpora have been conducted and their results are presented that highlights the efficiency, both in robustness and in performance, of the robust autoencoder ensemble-based approach when detecting both independent and contextual anomalies. Diverse range of tasks, including classification, sentiment analysis, and spam detection, across eight different corpora, have been studied in these experiments.</description>

      <title>Faithful Attention Explainer: Verbalizing Decisions Based on Discriminative Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, model explanation methods have been designed to interpret model decisions faithfully and intuitively so that users can easily understand them. In this paper, we propose a framework, Faithful Attention Explainer (FAE), capable of generating faithful textual explanations regarding the attended-to features. Towards this goal, we deploy an attention module that takes the visual feature maps from the classifier for sentence generation. Furthermore, our method successfully learns the association between features and words, which allows a novel attention enforcement module for attention explanation. Our model achieves promising performance in caption quality metrics and a faithful decision-relevance metric on two datasets (CUB and ACT-X). In addition, we show that FAE can interpret gaze-based human attention, as human gaze indicates the discriminative features that humans use for decision-making, demonstrating the potential of deploying human gaze for advanced human-AI interaction.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Workflow for Multimodal Fine-Grained Training Assistants Towards Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents have emerged as promising protocols for automatically understanding the language-based environment, particularly with the exponential development of large language models (LLMs). However, a fine-grained, comprehensive understanding of multimodal environments remains under-explored. This work designs an autonomous workflow tailored for integrating AI agents seamlessly into extended reality (XR) applications for fine-grained training. We present a demonstration of a multimodal fine-grained training assistant for LEGO brick assembly in a pilot XR environment. Specifically, we design a cerebral language agent that integrates LLM with memory, planning, and interaction with XR tools and a vision-language agent, enabling agents to decide their actions based on past experiences. Furthermore, we introduce LEGO-MRTA, a multimodal fine-grained assembly dialogue dataset synthesized automatically in the workflow served by a commercial LLM. This dataset comprises multimodal instruction manuals, conversations, XR responses, and vision question answering. Last, we present several prevailing open-resource LLMs as benchmarks, assessing their performance with and without fine-tuning on the proposed dataset. We anticipate that the broader impact of this workflow will advance the development of smarter assistants for seamless user interaction in XR environments, fostering research in both AI and HCI communities.</description>

      <title>Can formal argumentative reasoning enhance LLMs performances?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years witnessed significant performance advancements in deep-learning-driven natural language models, with a strong focus on the development and release of Large Language Models (LLMs). These improvements resulted in better quality AI-generated output but rely on resource-expensive training and upgrading of models. Although different studies have proposed a range of techniques to enhance LLMs without retraining, none have considered computational argumentation as an option. This is a missed opportunity since computational argumentation is an intuitive mechanism that formally captures agents' interactions and the information conflict that may arise during such interplays, and so it seems well-suited for boosting the reasoning and conversational abilities of LLMs in a seamless manner. In this paper, we present a pipeline (MQArgEng) and preliminary study to evaluate the effect of introducing computational argumentation semantics on the performance of LLMs. Our experiment's goal was to provide a proof-of-concept and a feasibility analysis in order to foster (or deter) future research towards a fully-fledged argumentation engine plugin for LLMs. Exploratory results using the MT-Bench indicate that MQArgEng provides a moderate performance gain in most of the examined topical categories and, as such, show promise and warrant further research.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Dialogue State Tracking Models through LLM-backed User-Agents Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is designed to monitor the evolving dialogue state in the conversations and plays a pivotal role in developing task-oriented dialogue systems. However, obtaining the annotated data for the DST task is usually a costly endeavor. In this paper, we focus on employing LLMs to generate dialogue data to reduce dialogue collection and annotation costs. Specifically, GPT-4 is used to simulate the user and agent interaction, generating thousands of dialogues annotated with DST labels. Then a two-stage fine-tuning on LLaMA 2 is performed on the generated data and the real data for the DST prediction. Experimental results on two public DST benchmarks show that with the generated dialogue data, our model performs better than the baseline trained solely on real data. In addition, our approach is also capable of adapting to the dynamic demands in real-world scenarios, generating dialogues in new domains swiftly. After replacing dialogue segments in any domain with the corresponding generated ones, the model achieves comparable performance to the model trained on real data.</description>

      <title>Surgical Feature-Space Decomposition of LLMs: Why, When and How?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank approximations, of the weight and feature space can enhance the performance of deep learning models, whether in terms of improving generalization or reducing the latency of inference. However, there is no clear consensus yet on \emph{how}, \emph{when} and \emph{why} these approximations are helpful for large language models (LLMs). In this work, we empirically study the efficacy of weight and feature space decomposition in transformer-based LLMs. We demonstrate that surgical decomposition not only provides critical insights into the trade-off between compression and language modelling performance, but also sometimes enhances commonsense reasoning performance of LLMs. Our empirical analysis identifies specific network segments that intrinsically exhibit a low-rank structure. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the implications of low-rank approximations on model bias. Overall, our findings offer a novel perspective on optimizing LLMs, presenting the low-rank approximation not only as a tool for performance enhancements, but also as a means to potentially rectify biases within these models. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/nyunAI/SFSD-LLM}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>Assessing Political Bias in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assessment of societal biases within Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a critical concern in the contemporary discourse surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics and their impact. Especially, recognizing and considering political biases is important for practical applications to gain a deeper understanding of the possibilities and behaviors and to prevent unwanted statements. As the upcoming elections of the European Parliament will not remain unaffected by LLMs, we evaluate the bias of the current most popular open-source models concerning political issues within the European Union (EU) from a German perspective. To do so, we use the "Wahl-O-Mat", a voting advice application used in Germany, to determine which political party is the most aligned for the respective LLM. We show that larger models, such as Llama3-70B, tend to align more closely with left-leaning political parties like GR\"UNE and Volt, while smaller models often remain neutral, particularly in English. This highlights the nuanced behavior of LLMs and the importance of language in shaping their political stances. Our findings underscore the importance of rigorously assessing and addressing societal bias in LLMs to safeguard the integrity and fairness of applications that employ the power of modern machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Case-Based Reasoning Approach for Solving Financial Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring a machine's understanding of human language often involves assessing its reasoning skills, i.e. logical process of deriving answers to questions. While recent language models have shown remarkable proficiency in text based tasks, their efficacy in complex reasoning problems involving heterogeneous information such as text, tables, and numbers remain uncertain. Addressing this gap, FinQA introduced a numerical reasoning dataset for financial documents and simultaneously proposed a program generation approach . Our investigation reveals that half of the errors (48%) stem from incorrect operations being generated. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to tackle numerical reasoning problems using case based reasoning (CBR), an artificial intelligence paradigm that provides problem solving guidance by offering similar cases (i.e. similar questions and corresponding logical programs). Our model retrieves relevant cases to address a given question, and then generates an answer based on the retrieved cases and contextual information. Through experiments on the FinQA dataset, we demonstrate competitive performance of our approach and additionally show that by expanding case repository, we can help solving complex multi step programs which FinQA showed weakness of.</description>

      <title>LeaPformer: Enabling Linear Transformers for Autoregressive and Simultaneous Tasks via Learned Proportions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising approach to preserving model performance in linearized transformers is to employ position-based re-weighting functions. However, state-of-the-art re-weighting functions rely heavily on target sequence lengths, making it difficult or impossible to apply them to autoregressive and simultaneous tasks, where the target and sometimes even the input sequence length are unknown. To address this issue, we propose Learned Proportions (LeaP) and LeaPformers. Our contribution is built on two major components. First, we generalize the dependence on explicit positional representations and sequence lengths into dependence on sequence proportions for re-weighting. Second, we replace static positional representations with dynamic proportions derived via a compact module, enabling more flexible attention concentration patterns. We evaluate LeaPformer against eight representative efficient transformers on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, showing that LeaPformer achieves the best quality-throughput trade-off, as well as LeaPformer to Wikitext-103 autoregressive language modeling and simultaneous speech-to-text translation for two language pairs, achieving competitive results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to understand emotions is an essential component of human-like artificial intelligence, as emotions greatly influence human cognition, decision making, and social interactions. In addition to emotion recognition in conversations, the task of identifying the potential causes behind an individual's emotional state in conversations, is of great importance in many application scenarios. We organize SemEval-2024 Task 3, named Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations, which aims at extracting all pairs of emotions and their corresponding causes from conversations. Under different modality settings, it consists of two subtasks: Textual Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations (TECPE) and Multimodal Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations (MECPE). The shared task has attracted 143 registrations and 216 successful submissions. In this paper, we introduce the task, dataset and evaluation settings, summarize the systems of the top teams, and discuss the findings of the participants.</description>

      <title>MeteoRA: Multiple-tasks Embedded LoRA for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{pretrain+fine-tune} paradigm is foundational in deploying large language models (LLMs) across a diverse range of downstream applications. Among these, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) stands out for its parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), producing numerous off-the-shelf task-specific LoRA adapters. However, this approach requires explicit task intention selection, posing challenges for automatic task sensing and switching during inference with multiple existing LoRA adapters embedded in a single LLM. In this work, we introduce \textbf{\method} (\textbf{M}ultiple-\textbf{T}asks embedded \textbf{LoRA}), a scalable multi-knowledge LoRA fusion framework designed for LLMs. \method\ integrates various LoRA adapters in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style into the base LLM, enabling the model to automatically select the most pertinent adapter based on the task input. This advancement significantly enhances the LLM's capability to handle composite tasks that require different adapters to solve various components of the problem. Our evaluations, featuring the LlaMA2-13B and LlaMA3-8B base models equipped with off-the-shelf 28 LoRA adapters through \method, demonstrate equivalent performance with the individual adapters. Furthermore, both base models equipped with \method\ achieve superior performance in sequentially solving composite tasks with ten problems in only a single inference process, highlighting the ability of timely intention switching in \method\ embedded LLMs.</description>

      <title>Large language models for sentiment analysis of newspaper articles during COVID-19: The Guardian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the news media coverage encompassed a wide range of topics that includes viral transmission, allocation of medical resources, and government response measures. There have been studies on sentiment analysis of social media platforms during COVID-19 to understand the public response given the rise of cases and government strategies implemented to control the spread of the virus. Sentiment analysis can provide a better understanding of changes in societal opinions and emotional trends during the pandemic. Apart from social media, newspapers have played a vital role in the dissemination of information, including information from the government, experts, and also the public about various topics. A study of sentiment analysis of newspaper sources during COVID-19 for selected countries can give an overview of how the media covered the pandemic. In this study, we select The Guardian newspaper and provide a sentiment analysis during various stages of COVID-19 that includes initial transmission, lockdowns and vaccination. We employ novel large language models (LLMs) and refine them with expert-labelled sentiment analysis data. We also provide an analysis of sentiments experienced pre-pandemic for comparison. The results indicate that during the early pandemic stages, public sentiment prioritised urgent crisis response, later shifting focus to addressing the impact on health and the economy. In comparison with related studies about social media sentiment analyses, we found a discrepancy between The Guardian with dominance of negative sentiments (sad, annoyed, anxious and denial), suggesting that social media offers a more diversified emotional reflection. We found a grim narrative in The Guardian with overall dominance of negative sentiments, pre and during COVID-19 across news sections including Australia, UK, World News, and Opinion</description>

      <title>RNG: Reducing Multi-level Noise and Multi-grained Semantic Gap for Joint Multimodal Aspect-Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important multimodal sentiment analysis task, Joint Multimodal Aspect-Sentiment Analysis (JMASA), aiming to jointly extract aspect terms and their associated sentiment polarities from the given text-image pairs, has gained increasing concerns. Existing works encounter two limitations: (1) multi-level modality noise, i.e., instance- and feature-level noise; and (2) multi-grained semantic gap, i.e., coarse- and fine-grained gap. Both issues may interfere with accurate identification of aspect-sentiment pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework named RNG for JMASA. Specifically, to simultaneously reduce multi-level modality noise and multi-grained semantic gap, we design three constraints: (1) Global Relevance Constraint (GR-Con) based on text-image similarity for instance-level noise reduction, (2) Information Bottleneck Constraint (IB-Con) based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle for feature-level noise reduction, and (3) Semantic Consistency Constraint (SC-Con) based on mutual information maximization in a contrastive learning way for multi-grained semantic gap reduction. Extensive experiments on two datasets validate our new state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method for News Article Event-Based Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding news articles is a crucial tool for multiple fields, such as media bias detection, identifying fake news, and news recommendations. However, existing news embedding methods are not optimized for capturing the latent context of news events. In many cases, news embedding methods rely on full-textual information and neglect the importance of time-relevant embedding generation. Here, we aim to address these shortcomings by presenting a novel lightweight method that optimizes news embedding generation by focusing on the entities and themes mentioned in the articles and their historical connections to specific events. We suggest a method composed of three stages. First, we process and extract the events, entities, and themes for the given news articles. Second, we generate periodic time embeddings for themes and entities by training timely separated GloVe models on current and historical data. Lastly, we concatenate the news embeddings generated by two distinct approaches: Smooth Inverse Frequency (SIF) for article-level vectors and Siamese Neural Networks for embeddings with nuanced event-related information. To test and evaluate our method, we leveraged over 850,000 news articles and 1,000,000 events from the GDELT project. For validation purposes, we conducted a comparative analysis of different news embedding generation methods, applying them twice to a shared event detection task - first on articles published within the same day and subsequently on those published within the same month. Our experiments show that our method significantly improves the Precision-Recall (PR) AUC across all tasks and datasets. Specifically, we observed an average PR AUC improvement of 2.15% and 2.57% compared to SIF, as well as 2.57% and 2.43% compared to the semi-supervised approach for daily and monthly shared event detection tasks, respectively.</description>

      <title>Multi-domain Knowledge Graph Collaborative Pre-training and Prompt Tuning for Diverse Downstream Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide reliable external knowledge for a wide variety of AI tasks in the form of structured triples. Knowledge graph pre-training (KGP) aims to pre-train neural networks on large-scale KGs and provide unified interfaces to enhance different downstream tasks, which is a key direction for KG management, maintenance, and applications. Existing works often focus on purely research questions in open domains, or they are not open source due to data security and privacy in real scenarios. Meanwhile, existing studies have not explored the training efficiency and transferability of KGP models in depth. To address these problems, We propose a framework MuDoK to achieve multi-domain collaborative pre-training and efficient prefix prompt tuning to serve diverse downstream tasks like recommendation and text understanding. Our design is a plug-and-play prompt learning approach that can be flexibly adapted to different downstream task backbones. In response to the lack of open-source benchmarks, we constructed a new multi-domain KGP benchmark called KPI with two large-scale KGs and six different sub-domain tasks to evaluate our method and open-sourced it for subsequent research. We evaluated our approach based on constructed KPI benchmarks using diverse backbone models in heterogeneous downstream tasks. The experimental results show that our framework brings significant performance gains, along with its generality, efficiency, and transferability.</description>

      <title>Presentations are not always linear! GNN meets LLM for Document-to-Presentation Transformation with Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically generating a presentation from the text of a long document is a challenging and useful problem. In contrast to a flat summary, a presentation needs to have a better and non-linear narrative, i.e., the content of a slide can come from different and non-contiguous parts of the given document. However, it is difficult to incorporate such non-linear mapping of content to slides and ensure that the content is faithful to the document. LLMs are prone to hallucination and their performance degrades with the length of the input document. Towards this, we propose a novel graph based solution where we learn a graph from the input document and use a combination of graph neural network and LLM to generate a presentation with attribution of content for each slide. We conduct thorough experiments to show the merit of our approach compared to directly using LLMs for this task.</description>

Abstract: Recent work has aimed to improve LLM generations by filtering out hallucinations, thereby improving the precision of the information in responses. Correctness of a long-form response, however, also depends on the recall of multiple pieces of information relevant to the question. In this paper, we introduce Atomic Self-Consistency (ASC), a technique for improving the recall of relevant information in an LLM response. ASC follows recent work, Universal Self-Consistency (USC) in using multiple stochastic samples from an LLM to improve the long-form response. Unlike USC which only focuses on selecting the best single generation, ASC picks authentic subparts from the samples and merges them into a superior composite answer. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we show that merging relevant subparts of multiple samples performs significantly better than picking a single sample. ASC demonstrates significant gains over USC on multiple factoids and open-ended QA datasets - ASQA, QAMPARI, QUEST, ELI5 with ChatGPT and Llama2. Our analysis also reveals untapped potential for enhancing long-form generations using approach of merging multiple samples.</description>

      <title>Dataset Mention Extraction in Scientific Articles Using Bi-LSTM-CRF Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Datasets are critical for scientific research, playing an important role in replication, reproducibility, and efficiency. Researchers have recently shown that datasets are becoming more important for science to function properly, even serving as artifacts of study themselves. However, citing datasets is not a common or standard practice in spite of recent efforts by data repositories and funding agencies. This greatly affects our ability to track their usage and importance. A potential solution to this problem is to automatically extract dataset mentions from scientific articles. In this work, we propose to achieve such extraction by using a neural network based on a Bi-LSTM-CRF architecture. Our method achieves F1 = 0.885 in social science articles released as part of the Rich Context Dataset. We discuss the limitations of the current datasets and propose modifications to the model to be done in the future.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the RAG-RLRC-LaySum framework, designed to make complex biomedical research understandable to laymen through advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Our Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution, enhanced by a reranking method, utilizes multiple knowledge sources to ensure the precision and pertinence of lay summaries. Additionally, our Reinforcement Learning for Readability Control (RLRC) strategy improves readability, making scientific content comprehensible to non-specialists. Evaluations using the publicly accessible PLOS and eLife datasets show that our methods surpass Plain Gemini model, demonstrating a 20% increase in readability scores, a 15% improvement in ROUGE-2 relevance scores, and a 10% enhancement in factual accuracy. The RAG-RLRC-LaySum framework effectively democratizes scientific knowledge, enhancing public engagement with biomedical discoveries.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Different Efficient Fine Tuning Methods of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Low-Resource Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of large language models (LLMs), arXiv:2305.16938 showed that few-shot full-model fine-tuning -- namely Vanilla Fine Tuning (FT) and Pattern-Based Fine Tuning (PBFT) --, and In-Context Learning (ICL) generalize similarly on Out-Of-Domain (OOD) datasets, but vary in terms of task adaptation. However, they both pose challenges, especially in term of memory requirements. In this paper, we further try to push the understanding of different fine-tuning strategies for LLM and aim to bring a myriad of these on the same pedestal for an elaborate comparison with full-model fine-tuning on two diverse datasets. To that end, we conducted a series of experiments, beginning with state-of-the-art methods like vanilla fine-tuning and Pattern-Based Fine-Tuning (PBFT) on pre-trained models across two datasets, COLA and MNLI. We then investigate adaptive fine-tuning and the efficiency of LoRA adapters in a few-shot setting. Finally, we also compare an alternative approach that has gained recent popularity -- context distillation -- with the vanilla FT and PBFT with and without few-shot setup.
  Our findings suggest that these alternative strategies that we explored can exhibit out-of-domain generalization comparable to that of vanilla FT and PBFT. PBFT under-performs Vanilla FT on out-of-domain (OOD) data, emphasizing the need for effective prompts. Further, our adaptive-fine tuning and LoRA experiments perform comparable or slightly worse than the standard fine-tunings as anticipated, since standard fine-tunings involve tuning the entire model. Finally, our context distillation experiments out-perform the standard fine-tuning methods. These findings underscore that eventually the choice of an appropriate fine-tuning method depends on the available resources (memory, compute, data) and task adaptability.</description>

      <title>Investigating Symbolic Capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompting techniques have significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various complex tasks, including reasoning, planning, and solving math word problems. However, most research has predominantly focused on language-based reasoning and word problems, often overlooking the potential of LLMs in handling symbol-based calculations and reasoning. This study aims to bridge this gap by rigorously evaluating LLMs on a series of symbolic tasks, such as addition, multiplication, modulus arithmetic, numerical precision, and symbolic counting. Our analysis encompasses eight LLMs, including four enterprise-grade and four open-source models, of which three have been pre-trained on mathematical tasks. The assessment framework is anchored in Chomsky's Hierarchy, providing a robust measure of the computational abilities of these models. The evaluation employs minimally explained prompts alongside the zero-shot Chain of Thoughts technique, allowing models to navigate the solution process autonomously. The findings reveal a significant decline in LLMs' performance on context-free and context-sensitive symbolic tasks as the complexity, represented by the number of symbols, increases. Notably, even the fine-tuned GPT3.5 exhibits only marginal improvements, mirroring the performance trends observed in other models. Across the board, all models demonstrated a limited generalization ability on these symbol-intensive tasks. This research underscores LLMs' challenges with increasing symbolic complexity and highlights the need for specialized training, memory and architectural adjustments to enhance their proficiency in symbol-based reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Equipping Transformer with Random-Access Reading for Long-Context Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context modeling presents a significant challenge for transformer-based large language models (LLMs) due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism and issues with length extrapolation caused by pretraining exclusively on short inputs. Existing methods address computational complexity through techniques such as text chunking, the kernel approach, and structured attention, and tackle length extrapolation problems through positional encoding, continued pretraining, and data engineering. These approaches typically require $\textbf{sequential access}$ to the document, necessitating reading from the first to the last token. We contend that for goal-oriented reading of long documents, such sequential access is not necessary, and a proficiently trained model can learn to omit hundreds of less pertinent tokens. Inspired by human reading behaviors and existing empirical observations, we propose $\textbf{random access}$, a novel reading strategy that enables transformers to efficiently process long documents without examining every token. Experimental results from pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference phases validate the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Dataset Decomposition: Faster LLM Training with Variable Sequence Length Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on datasets consisting of fixed-length token sequences. These datasets are created by randomly concatenating documents of various lengths and then chunking them into sequences of a predetermined target length. However, this method of concatenation can lead to cross-document attention within a sequence, which is neither a desirable learning signal nor computationally efficient. Additionally, training on long sequences becomes computationally prohibitive due to the quadratic cost of attention. In this study, we introduce dataset decomposition, a novel variable sequence length training technique, to tackle these challenges. We decompose a dataset into a union of buckets, each containing sequences of the same size extracted from a unique document. During training, we use variable sequence length and batch size, sampling simultaneously from all buckets with a curriculum. In contrast to the concat-and-chunk baseline, which incurs a fixed attention cost at every step of training, our proposed method incurs a penalty proportional to the actual document lengths at each step, resulting in significant savings in training time. We train an 8k context-length 1B model at the same cost as a 2k context-length model trained with the baseline approach. Experiments on a web-scale corpus demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances performance on standard language evaluations and long-context benchmarks, reaching target accuracy 3x faster compared to the baseline. Our method not only enables efficient pretraining on long sequences but also scales effectively with dataset size. Lastly, we shed light on a critical yet less studied aspect of training large language models: the distribution and curriculum of sequence lengths, which results in a non-negligible difference in performance.</description>

Abstract: Emotion plays a crucial role in human conversation. This paper underscores the significance of considering emotion in speech translation. We present the MELD-ST dataset for the emotion-aware speech translation task, comprising English-to-Japanese and English-to-German language pairs. Each language pair includes about 10,000 utterances annotated with emotion labels from the MELD dataset. Baseline experiments using the SeamlessM4T model on the dataset indicate that fine-tuning with emotion labels can enhance translation performance in some settings, highlighting the need for further research in emotion-aware speech translation systems.</description>

      <title>A Multilingual Similarity Dataset for News Article Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the writing frame of news articles is vital for addressing social issues, and thus has attracted notable attention in the fields of communication studies. Yet, assessing such news article frames remains a challenge due to the absence of a concrete and unified standard dataset that considers the comprehensive nuances within news content.
  To address this gap, we introduce an extended version of a large labeled news article dataset with 16,687 new labeled pairs. Leveraging the pairwise comparison of news articles, our method frees the work of manual identification of frame classes in traditional news frame analysis studies. Overall we introduce the most extensive cross-lingual news article similarity dataset available to date with 26,555 labeled news article pairs across 10 languages. Each data point has been meticulously annotated according to a codebook detailing eight critical aspects of news content, under a human-in-the-loop framework. Application examples demonstrate its potential in unearthing country communities within global news coverage, exposing media bias among news outlets, and quantifying the factors related to news creation. We envision that this news similarity dataset will broaden our understanding of the media ecosystem in terms of news coverage of events and perspectives across countries, locations, languages, and other social constructs. By doing so, it can catalyze advancements in social science research and applied methodologies, thereby exerting a profound impact on our society.</description>

      <title>DiffNorm: Self-Supervised Normalization for Non-autoregressive Speech-to-speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) are recently applied in direct speech-to-speech translation systems, which convert speech across different languages without intermediate text data. Although NATs generate high-quality outputs and offer faster inference than autoregressive models, they tend to produce incoherent and repetitive results due to complex data distribution (e.g., acoustic and linguistic variations in speech). In this work, we introduce DiffNorm, a diffusion-based normalization strategy that simplifies data distributions for training NAT models. After training with a self-supervised noise estimation objective, DiffNorm constructs normalized target data by denoising synthetically corrupted speech features. Additionally, we propose to regularize NATs with classifier-free guidance, improving model robustness and translation quality by randomly dropping out source information during training. Our strategies result in a notable improvement of about +7 ASR-BLEU for English-Spanish (En-Es) and +2 ASR-BLEU for English-French (En-Fr) translations on the CVSS benchmark, while attaining over 14x speedup for En-Es and 5x speedup for En-Fr translations compared to autoregressive baselines.</description>

      <title>Metadata Integration for Spam Reviews Detection on Vietnamese E-commerce Websites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of detecting spam reviews (opinions) has received significant attention in recent years, especially with the rapid development of e-commerce. Spam reviews are often classified based on comment content, but in some cases, it is insufficient for models to accurately determine the review label. In this work, we introduce the ViSpamReviews v2 dataset, which includes metadata of reviews with the objective of integrating supplementary attributes for spam review classification. We propose a novel approach to simultaneously integrate both textual and categorical attributes into the classification model. In our experiments, the product category proved effective when combined with deep neural network (DNN) models, while text features performed well on both DNN models and the model achieved state-of-the-art performance in the problem of detecting spam reviews on Vietnamese e-commerce websites, namely PhoBERT. Specifically, the PhoBERT model achieves the highest accuracy when combined with product description features generated from the SPhoBert model, which is the combination of PhoBERT and SentenceBERT. Using the macro-averaged F1 score, the task of classifying spam reviews achieved 87.22% (an increase of 1.64% compared to the baseline), while the task of identifying the type of spam reviews achieved an accuracy of 73.49% (an increase of 1.93% compared to the baseline).</description>

      <title>DEGAP: Dual Event-Guided Adaptive Prefixes for Templated-Based Event Argument Extraction Model with Slot Querying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in event argument extraction (EAE) involve incorporating beneficial auxiliary information into models during training and inference, such as retrieved instances and event templates. Additionally, some studies introduce learnable prefix vectors to models. These methods face three challenges: (1) insufficient utilization of relevant event instances due to deficiencies in retrieval; (2) neglect of important information provided by relevant event templates; (3) the advantages of prefixes are constrained due to their inability to meet the specific informational needs of EAE. In this work, we propose DEGAP, which addresses the above challenges through two simple yet effective components: (1) dual prefixes, where the instance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn information from different event instances and templates, respectively, and then provide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval; (2) event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which guides the prefixes based on the target event to fully leverage their advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE). Further analysis verifies the importance of the proposed design and the effectiveness of the main components.</description>

      <title>Mosaic IT: Enhancing Instruction Tuning with Data Mosaics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finetuning large language models with a variety of instruction-response pairs has enhanced their capability to understand and follow instructions. Current instruction tuning primarily relies on teacher models or human intervention to generate and refine the instructions and responses, which are costly, non-sustainable, and may lack diversity. In this paper, we introduce Mosaic Instruction Tuning (Mosaic-IT), a human/model-free method that can efficiently create rich and diverse augmentations from existing instruction tuning data to enhance the finetuned LLM.Mosaic-IT randomly concatenates multiple instruction data into one and trains the model to produce the corresponding responses with predefined higher-level meta-instructions to strengthen its multi-step instruction-following and format-following skills. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a superior performance and training efficiency of Mosaic-IT, which achieves consistent performance improvements over various benchmarks and an 80% reduction in training costs compared with original instruction tuning. Our codes and data are available at https://github.com/tianyi-lab/Mosaic-IT.</description>

      <title>High Performance P300 Spellers Using GPT2 Word Prediction With Cross-Subject Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) severely impairs patients' ability to communicate, often leading to a decline in their quality of life within a few years of diagnosis. The P300 speller brain-computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication method by interpreting a subject's EEG response to characters presented on a grid interface.
  This paper addresses the common speed limitations encountered in training efficient P300-based multi-subject classifiers by introducing innovative "across-subject" classifiers. We leverage a combination of the second-generation Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2) and Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize stimuli and suggest word completion choices based on typing history. Additionally, we employ a multi-layered smoothing technique to accommodate out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
  Through extensive simulations involving random sampling of EEG data from subjects, we demonstrate significant speed enhancements in typing passages containing rare and OOV words. These optimizations result in approximately 10% improvement in character-level typing speed and up to 40% improvement in multi-word prediction. We demonstrate that augmenting standard row/column highlighting techniques with layered word prediction yields close-to-optimal performance.
  Furthermore, we explore both "within-subject" and "across-subject" training techniques, showing that speed improvements are consistent across both approaches.</description>

Abstract: This study presents the development and evaluation of a ByteT5-based multilingual translation model tailored for translating the Bible into underrepresented languages. Utilizing the comprehensive Johns Hopkins University Bible Corpus, we trained the model to capture the intricate nuances of character-based and morphologically rich languages. Our results, measured by the BLEU score and supplemented with sample translations, suggest the model can improve accessibility to sacred texts. It effectively handles the distinctive biblical lexicon and structure, thus bridging the linguistic divide. The study also discusses the model's limitations and suggests pathways for future enhancements, focusing on expanding access to sacred literature across linguistic boundaries.</description>

      <title>AdpQ: A Zero-shot Calibration Free Adaptive Post Training Quantization Method for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-growing computational complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient deployment strategies. The current state-of-the-art approaches for Post-training Quantization (PTQ) often require calibration to achieve the desired accuracy. This paper presents AdpQ, a novel zero-shot adaptive PTQ method for LLMs that achieves the state-of-the-art performance in low-precision quantization (e.g. 3-bit) without requiring any calibration data. Inspired by Adaptive LASSO regression model, our proposed approach tackles the challenge of outlier activations by separating salient weights using an adaptive soft-thresholding method. Guided by Adaptive LASSO, this method ensures that the quantized weights distribution closely follows the originally trained weights and eliminates the need for calibration data entirely, setting our method apart from popular approaches such as SpQR and AWQ. Furthermore, our method offers an additional benefit in terms of privacy preservation by eliminating any calibration or training data. We also delve deeper into the information-theoretic underpinnings of the proposed method. We demonstrate that it leverages the Adaptive LASSO to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the quantized weights and the originally trained weights. This minimization ensures the quantized model retains the Shannon information content of the original model to a great extent, guaranteeing efficient deployment without sacrificing accuracy or information. Our results achieve the same accuracy as the existing methods on various LLM benchmarks while the quantization time is reduced by at least 10x, solidifying our contribution to efficient and privacy-preserving LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>You don't understand me!: Comparing ASR results for L1 and L2 speakers of Swedish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems has constantly increased in state-of-the-art development. However, performance tends to decrease considerably in more challenging conditions (e.g., background noise, multiple speaker social conversations) and with more atypical speakers (e.g., children, non-native speakers or people with speech disorders), which signifies that general improvements do not necessarily transfer to applications that rely on ASR, e.g., educational software for younger students or language learners. In this study, we focus on the gap in performance between recognition results for native and non-native, read and spontaneous, Swedish utterances transcribed by different ASR services. We compare the recognition results using Word Error Rate and analyze the linguistic factors that may generate the observed transcription errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 360Zhinao models with 7B parameter size and context lengths spanning 4K, 32K and 360K, all available at https://github.com/Qihoo360/360zhinao. For rapid development in pretraining, we establish a stable and sensitive ablation environment to evaluate and compare experiment runs with minimal model size. Under such guidance, we perfect our data cleaning and composition strategies to pretrain $\texttt{360Zhinao-7B-Base}$ on 3.4T tokens. We also mainly emphasize data during alignment, where we strive to balance quantity and quality with filtering and reformatting. With tailored data, 360Zhinao-7B's context window is easily extended to 32K and 360K. RMs and RLHF are trained following SFT and credibly applied to specific tasks. All together these contributions lead to 360Zhinao-7B's competitive performance among models of similar size.</description>

      <title>Disperse-Then-Merge: Pushing the Limits of Instruction Tuning via Alignment Tax Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction-following corpus is a crucial approach toward the alignment of large language models (LLMs). However, the performance of LLMs on standard knowledge and reasoning benchmarks tends to suffer from deterioration at the latter stage of the SFT process, echoing the phenomenon of alignment tax. Through our pilot study, we put a hypothesis that the data biases are probably one cause behind the phenomenon. To address the issue, we introduce a simple disperse-then-merge framework. To be concrete, we disperse the instruction-following data into portions and train multiple sub-models using different data portions. Then we merge multiple models into a single one via model merging techniques. Despite its simplicity, our framework outperforms various sophisticated methods such as data curation and training regularization on a series of standard knowledge and reasoning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Distilling Instruction-following Abilities of Large Language Models with Task-aware Curriculum Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of instruction tuning aligns pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with open-domain instructions and human-preferred responses. While several studies have explored autonomous approaches to distilling and annotating instructions from more powerful proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT, they often neglect the impact of task distributions and the varying difficulty of instructions of the training sets. This oversight can lead to imbalanced knowledge capabilities and poor generalization powers of small student LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Task-Aware Curriculum Planning for Instruction Refinement (TAPIR), a multi-round distillation framework with balanced task distributions and dynamic difficulty adjustment. This approach utilizes an oracle LLM to select instructions that are difficult for a student LLM to follow and distill instructions with balanced task distributions. By incorporating curriculum planning, our approach systematically escalates the difficulty levels, progressively enhancing the student LLM's capabilities. We rigorously evaluate TAPIR using two widely recognized benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench. The empirical results demonstrate that the student LLMs, trained with our method and less training data, outperform larger instruction-tuned models and strong distillation baselines. The improvement is particularly notable in complex tasks, such as logical reasoning and code generation.</description>

      <title>LIRE: listwise reward enhancement for preference alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, tremendous strides have been made to align the generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values to mitigate toxic or unhelpful content. Leveraging Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective and is widely adopted by researchers. However, implementing RLHF is complex, and its sensitivity to hyperparameters renders achieving stable performance and scalability challenging. Furthermore, prevailing approaches to preference alignment primarily concentrate on pairwise comparisons, with limited exploration into multi-response scenarios, thereby overlooking the potential richness within the candidate pool. For the above reasons, we propose a new approach: Listwise Reward Enhancement for Preference Alignment (LIRE), a gradient-based reward optimization approach that incorporates the offline rewards of multiple responses into a streamlined listwise framework, thus eliminating the need for online sampling during training. LIRE is straightforward to implement, requiring minimal parameter tuning, and seamlessly aligns with the pairwise paradigm while naturally extending to multi-response scenarios. Moreover, we introduce a self-enhancement algorithm aimed at iteratively refining the reward during training. Our experiments demonstrate that LIRE consistently outperforms existing methods across several benchmarks on dialogue and summarization tasks, with good transferability to out-of-distribution data, assessed using proxy reward models and human annotators.</description>

      <title>The correlation between nativelike selection and prototypicality: a multilingual onomasiological case study using semantic embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In native speakers' lexical choices, a concept can be more readily expressed by one expression over another grammatical one, a phenomenon known as nativelike selection (NLS). In previous research, arbitrary chunks such as collocations have been considered crucial for this phenomenon. However, this study examines the possibility of analyzing the semantic motivation and deducibility behind some NLSs by exploring the correlation between NLS and prototypicality, specifically the onomasiological hypothesis of Grondelaers and Geeraerts (2003, Towards a pragmatic model of cognitive onomasiology. In Hubert Cuyckens, Ren\'e Dirven &amp; John R. Taylor (eds.), Cognitive approaches to lexical semantics, 67-92. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton). They hypothesized that "[a] referent is more readily named by a lexical item if it is a salient member of the category denoted by that item". To provide a preliminary investigation of this important but rarely explored phenomenon, a series of innovative methods and procedures, including the use of semantic embedding and interlingual comparisons, is designed. Specifically, potential NLSs are efficiently discovered through an automatic exploratory analysis using topic modeling techniques, and then confirmed by manual inspection through frame semantics. Finally, to account for the NLS in question, cluster analysis and behavioral profile analysis are conducted to uncover a language-specific prototype for the Chinese verb shang 'harm', providing supporting evidence for the correlation between NLS and prototypicality.</description>

      <title>Annotation-Efficient Preference Optimization for Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference optimization is a standard approach to fine-tuning large language models to align with human preferences. The quality, diversity, and quantity of the preference dataset are critical to the effectiveness of preference optimization. However, obtaining a large amount of high-quality and diverse preference annotations is difficult in many applications. This raises the question of how to use the limited annotation budget to create an effective preference dataset. To this end, we propose Annotation-Efficient Preference Optimization (AEPO). Instead of exhaustively annotating preference over all available response texts, AEPO selects a subset of responses that maximizes quality and diversity from the available responses, and then annotates preference over the selected ones. In this way, AEPO focuses the annotation budget on labeling preference over a smaller subset of responses with diversity and of high quality. We evaluate the performance of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using AEPO and show that it outperforms models trained using a standard DPO with the same annotation budget.

      <title>Knowledge-Driven Cross-Document Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) is a well-known NLP application often treated as a sentence- or document-level task. However, a handful of recent efforts explore it across documents or in the cross-document setting (CrossDocRE). This is distinct from the single document case because different documents often focus on disparate themes, while text within a document tends to have a single goal. Linking findings from disparate documents to identify new relationships is at the core of the popular literature-based knowledge discovery paradigm in biomedicine and other domains. Current CrossDocRE efforts do not consider domain knowledge, which are often assumed to be known to the reader when documents are authored. Here, we propose a novel approach, KXDocRE, that embed domain knowledge of entities with input text for cross-document RE. Our proposed framework has three main benefits over baselines: 1) it incorporates domain knowledge of entities along with documents' text; 2) it offers interpretability by producing explanatory text for predicted relations between entities 3) it improves performance over the prior methods.</description>

      <title>FlashRAG: A Modular Toolkit for Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have garnered considerable research attention. Numerous novel algorithms and models have been introduced to enhance various aspects of RAG systems. However, the absence of a standardized framework for implementation, coupled with the inherently intricate RAG process, makes it challenging and time-consuming for researchers to compare and evaluate these approaches in a consistent environment. Existing RAG toolkits like LangChain and LlamaIndex, while available, are often heavy and unwieldy, failing to meet the personalized needs of researchers. In response to this challenge, we propose FlashRAG, an efficient and modular open-source toolkit designed to assist researchers in reproducing existing RAG methods and in developing their own RAG algorithms within a unified framework. Our toolkit implements 12 advanced RAG methods and has gathered and organized 32 benchmark datasets. Our toolkit has various features, including customizable modular framework, rich collection of pre-implemented RAG works, comprehensive datasets, efficient auxiliary pre-processing scripts, and extensive and standard evaluation metrics. Our toolkit and resources are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG.</description>

      <title>ConTrans: Weak-to-Strong Alignment Engineering via Concept Transplantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring large language models (LLM) behave consistently with human goals, values, and intentions is crucial for their safety but yet computationally expensive. To reduce the computational cost of alignment training of LLMs, especially for those with a huge number of parameters, and to reutilize learned value alignment, we propose ConTrans, a novel framework that enables weak-to-strong alignment transfer via concept transplantation. From the perspective of representation engineering, ConTrans refines concept vectors in value alignment from a source LLM (usually a weak yet aligned LLM). The refined concept vectors are then reformulated to adapt to the target LLM (usually a strong yet unaligned base LLM) via affine transformation. In the third step, ConTrans transplants the reformulated concept vectors into the residual stream of the target LLM. Experiments demonstrate the successful transplantation of a wide range of aligned concepts from 7B models to 13B and 70B models across multiple LLMs and LLM families. Remarkably, ConTrans even surpasses instruction-tuned models in terms of truthfulness. Experiment results validate the effectiveness of both inter-LLM-family and intra-LLM-family concept transplantation. Our work successfully demonstrates an alternative way to achieve weak-to-strong alignment generalization and control.</description>

      <title>Automated Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models with Task-Specific Exam Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method to measure the task-specific accuracy of Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RAG). Evaluation is performed by scoring the RAG on an automatically-generated synthetic exam composed of multiple choice questions based on the corpus of documents associated with the task. Our method is an automated, cost-efficient, interpretable, and robust strategy to select the optimal components for a RAG system. We leverage Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate the quality of an exam and its informativeness on task-specific accuracy. IRT also provides a natural way to iteratively improve the exam by eliminating the exam questions that are not sufficiently informative about a model's ability. We demonstrate our approach on four new open-ended Question-Answering tasks based on Arxiv abstracts, StackExchange questions, AWS DevOps troubleshooting guides, and SEC filings. In addition, our experiments reveal more general insights into factors impacting RAG performance like size, retrieval mechanism, prompting and fine-tuning. Most notably, our findings show that choosing the right retrieval algorithms often leads to bigger performance gains than simply using a larger language model.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Self-supervised Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective method of finding reasoning pathways in incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). To overcome the challenges of a large action space, a self-supervised pre-training method is proposed to warm up the policy network before the RL training stage. To alleviate the distributional mismatch issue in general self-supervised RL (SSRL), in our supervised learning (SL) stage, the agent selects actions based on the policy network and learns from generated labels; this self-generation of labels is the intuition behind the name self-supervised. With this training framework, the information density of our SL objective is increased and the agent is prevented from getting stuck with the early rewarded paths. Our self-supervised RL (SSRL) method improves the performance of RL by pairing it with the wide coverage achieved by SL during pretraining, since the breadth of the SL objective makes it infeasible to train an agent with that alone. We show that our SSRL model meets or exceeds current state-of-the-art results on all Hits@k and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) metrics on four large benchmark KG datasets. This SSRL method can be used as a plug-in for any RL architecture for a KGR task. We adopt two RL architectures, i.e., MINERVA and MultiHopKG as our baseline RL models and experimentally show that our SSRL model consistently outperforms both baselines on all of these four KG reasoning tasks.

      <title>CrossCheckGPT: Universal Hallucination Ranking for Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models are prone to hallucination, generating outputs that either contradict the input or are not grounded by factual information. Given the diversity in architectures, training data and instruction tuning techniques, there can be large variations in systems' susceptibility to hallucinations. To assess system hallucination robustness, hallucination ranking approaches have been developed for specific tasks such as image captioning, question answering, summarization, or biography generation. However, these approaches typically compare model outputs to gold-standard references or labels, limiting hallucination benchmarking for new domains. This work proposes "CrossCheckGPT", a reference-free universal hallucination ranking for multimodal foundation models. The core idea of CrossCheckGPT is that the same hallucinated content is unlikely to be generated by different independent systems, hence cross-system consistency can provide meaningful and accurate hallucination assessment scores. CrossCheckGPT can be applied to any model or task, provided that the information consistency between outputs can be measured through an appropriate distance metric. Focusing on multimodal large language models that generate text, we explore two information consistency measures: CrossCheck-explicit and CrossCheck-implicit. We showcase the applicability of our method for hallucination ranking across various modalities, namely the text, image, and audio-visual domains. Further, we propose the first audio-visual hallucination benchmark, "AVHalluBench", and illustrate the effectiveness of CrossCheckGPT, achieving correlations of 98% and 89% with human judgements on MHaluBench and AVHalluBench, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media conversations frequently suffer from toxicity, creating significant issues for users, moderators, and entire communities. Events in the real world, like elections or conflicts, can initiate and escalate toxic behavior online. Our study investigates how real-world events influence the origin and spread of toxicity in online discussions across various languages and regions. We gathered Reddit data comprising 4.5 million comments from 31 thousand posts in six different languages (Dutch, English, German, Arabic, Turkish and Spanish). We target fifteen major social and political world events that occurred between 2020 and 2023. We observe significant variations in toxicity, negative sentiment, and emotion expressions across different events and language communities, showing that toxicity is a complex phenomenon in which many different factors interact and still need to be investigated. We will release the data for further research along with our code.</description>

      <title>Do Language Models Enjoy Their Own Stories? Prompting Large Language Models for Automatic Story Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storytelling is an integral part of human experience and plays a crucial role in social interactions. Thus, Automatic Story Evaluation (ASE) and Generation (ASG) could benefit society in multiple ways, but they are challenging tasks which require high-level human abilities such as creativity, reasoning and deep understanding. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLM) now achieve state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can be used as substitutes for human annotators for ASE. We perform an extensive analysis of the correlations between LLM ratings, other automatic measures, and human annotations, and we explore the influence of prompting on the results and the explainability of LLM behaviour. Most notably, we find that LLMs outperform current automatic measures for system-level evaluation but still struggle at providing satisfactory explanations for their answers.</description>

      <title>xRAG: Extreme Context Compression for Retrieval-augmented Generation with One Token</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces xRAG, an innovative context compression method tailored for retrieval-augmented generation. xRAG reinterprets document embeddings in dense retrieval--traditionally used solely for retrieval--as features from the retrieval modality. By employing a modality fusion methodology, xRAG seamlessly integrates these embeddings into the language model representation space, effectively eliminating the need for their textual counterparts and achieving an extreme compression rate. In xRAG, the only trainable component is the modality bridge, while both the retriever and the language model remain frozen. This design choice allows for the reuse of offline-constructed document embeddings and preserves the plug-and-play nature of retrieval augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that xRAG achieves an average improvement of over 10% across six knowledge-intensive tasks, adaptable to various language model backbones, ranging from a dense 7B model to an 8x7B Mixture of Experts configuration. xRAG not only significantly outperforms previous context compression methods but also matches the performance of uncompressed models on several datasets, while reducing overall FLOPs by a factor of 3.53. Our work pioneers new directions in retrieval-augmented generation from the perspective of multimodality fusion, and we hope it lays the foundation for future efficient and scalable retrieval-augmented systems</description>

      <title>Slaves to the Law of Large Numbers: An Asymptotic Equipartition Property for Perplexity in Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new asymptotic equipartition property for the perplexity of a large piece of text generated by a language model and present theoretical arguments for this property. Perplexity, defined as a inverse likelihood function, is widely used as a performance metric for training language models. Our main result states that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text produced by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This means that language models are constrained to only produce outputs from a ``typical set", which we show, is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct outputs. We present preliminary experimental results from an open-source language model to support our theoretical claims. This work has possible practical applications for understanding and improving ``AI detection" tools and theoretical implications for the uniqueness, predictability and creative potential of generative models.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Good Spontaneous Multilingual Learners: Is the Multilingual Annotated Data Necessary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive language capabilities. However, most of the existing LLMs are all English-centric, which have very unstable and unbalanced performance across different languages. Multilingual alignment is an effective method to enhance the LLMs' multilingual capabilities. In this work, we explore the multilingual alignment paradigm which utilizes translation data and comprehensively investigate the spontaneous multilingual improvement of LLMs. We find that LLMs only instruction-tuned on question translation data without annotated answers are able to get significant multilingual performance enhancement even across a wide range of languages unseen during instruction-tuning. Additionally, we utilize different settings and mechanistic interpretability methods to comprehensively analyze the LLM's performance in the multilingual scenario.</description>

      <title>Towards Comprehensive and Efficient Post Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Safety Patching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) has been gaining increasing attention. However, current safety-aligned LLMs suffer from the fragile and imbalanced safety mechanisms, which can still be induced to generate unsafe responses, exhibit over-safety by rejecting safe user inputs, and fail to preserve general utility after safety alignment. To this end, we propose a novel post safety alignment (PSA) method to address these inherent and emerging safety challenges, including safety enhancement, over-safety mitigation, and utility preservation. In specific, we introduce \textsc{SafePatching}, a novel framework for comprehensive and efficient PSA, where two distinct safety patches are developed on the harmful data to enhance safety and mitigate over-safety concerns, and then seamlessly integrated into the target LLM backbone without compromising its utility. Extensive experiments show that \textsc{SafePatching} achieves a more comprehensive and efficient PSA than baseline methods. It even enhances the utility of the backbone, further optimizing the balance between being helpful and harmless in current aligned LLMs. Also, \textsc{SafePatching} demonstrates its superiority in continual PSA scenarios.</description>

      <title>Babysit A Language Model From Scratch: Interactive Language Learning by Trials and Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans are efficient language learners and inherently social creatures. Our language development is largely shaped by our social interactions, for example, the demonstration and feedback from caregivers. Contrary to human language learning, recent advancements in large language models have primarily adopted a non-interactive training paradigm, and refined pre-trained models through feedback afterward. In this work, we aim to examine how corrective feedback from interactions influences neural language acquisition from the ground up through systematically controlled experiments, assessing whether it contributes to learning efficiency in language models. We introduce a trial-and-demonstration (TnD) learning framework that incorporates three components: student trials, teacher demonstrations, and a reward conditioned on language competence at various developmental stages. Our experiments reveal that the TnD approach accelerates word acquisition for student models of equal and smaller numbers of parameters, and we highlight the significance of both trials and demonstrations. We further show that the teacher's choices of words influence students' word-specific learning efficiency, and a practice-makes-perfect effect is evident by a strong correlation between the frequency of words in trials and their respective learning curves. Our findings suggest that interactive language learning, with teacher demonstrations and student trials, can facilitate efficient word learning in language models.</description>

      <title>Semantic Density: Uncertainty Quantification in Semantic Space for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to various domains, concerns regarding the trustworthiness of LLMs in safety-critical scenarios have been raised, due to their unpredictable tendency to hallucinate and generate misinformation. Existing LLMs do not have an inherent functionality to provide the users with an uncertainty metric for each response it generates, making it difficult to evaluate trustworthiness. Although a number of works aim to develop uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, they have fundamental limitations, such as being restricted to classification tasks, requiring additional training and data, considering only lexical instead of semantic information, and being prompt-wise but not response-wise. A new framework is proposed in this paper to address these issues. Semantic density extracts uncertainty information for each response from a probability distribution perspective in semantic space. It has no restriction on task types and is "off-the-shelf" for new models and tasks. Experiments on seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including the latest Llama 3 and Mixtral-8x22B models, on four free-form question-answering benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of semantic density compared to prior approaches.</description>

      <title>Just rephrase it! Uncertainty estimation in closed-source language models via multiple rephrased queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models are sometimes distributed as open-source software but are also increasingly provided as a closed-source service. These closed-source large-language models typically see the widest usage by the public, however, they often do not provide an estimate of their uncertainty when responding to queries. As even the best models are prone to ``hallucinating" false information with high confidence, a lack of a reliable estimate of uncertainty limits the applicability of these models in critical settings. We explore estimating the uncertainty of closed-source LLMs via multiple rephrasings of an original base query. Specifically, we ask the model, multiple rephrased questions, and use the similarity of the answers as an estimate of uncertainty. We diverge from previous work in i) providing rules for rephrasing that are simple to memorize and use in practice ii) proposing a theoretical framework for why multiple rephrased queries obtain calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in the calibration of uncertainty estimates compared to the baseline and provides intuition as to how query strategies should be designed for optimal test calibration.</description>

      <title>Why Not Transform Chat Large Language Models to Non-English?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of non-English data limits the development of non-English large language models (LLMs). Transforming English-centric LLMs to non-English has been identified as an effective and resource-efficient method. Previous works start from base LLMs and perform knowledge distillation (KD) with data generated by stronger LLMs, e.g. GPT-4. Compared to base LLMs, chat LLMs are further optimized for advanced abilities, e.g. multi-turn conversation and human preference alignment, and thus more powerful in both helpfulness and safety. However, transforming a chat LLM involves two critical issues: (1) How can we effectively transfer advanced abilities without their supervised data? (2) How can we prevent the original knowledge from catastrophic forgetting during transformation? We target these issues by introducing a simple framework called TransLLM. For the first issue, TransLLM divides the transfer problem into some common sub-tasks with the translation chain-of-thought, which uses the translation as the bridge between English and non-English step-by-step. We further enhance the performance of sub-tasks with publicly available data. For the second issue, we propose a method comprising two synergistic components: low-rank adaptation for training to maintain the original LLM parameters, and recovery KD, which utilizes data generated by the chat LLM itself to recover the original knowledge from the frozen parameters. In the experiments, we transform the LLaMA-2-chat-7B to the Thai language. Our method, using only single-turn data, outperforms strong baselines and ChatGPT on multi-turn benchmark MT-bench. Furthermore, our method, without safety data, rejects more harmful queries of safety benchmark AdvBench than both ChatGPT and GPT-4.</description>

      <title>Vikhr: The Family of Open-Source Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models for Russian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a surge in the development of various Large Language Models (LLMs). However, text generation for languages other than English often faces significant challenges, including poor generation quality and the reduced computational performance due to the disproportionate representation of tokens in model's vocabulary. In this work, we address these issues and introduce Vikhr, a new state-of-the-art open-source instruction-tuned LLM designed specifically for the Russian language. Unlike previous efforts for Russian that utilize computationally inexpensive LoRA adapters on top of English-oriented models, Vikhr features an adapted tokenizer vocabulary and undergoes the continued pre-training and instruction tuning of all weights. This approach not only enhances the model's performance but also significantly improves its computational and contextual efficiency. The remarkable performance of Vikhr across various Russian-language benchmarks can also be attributed to our efforts in expanding instruction datasets and corpora for continued pre-training. Vikhr not only sets the new state of the art among open-source LLMs for Russian, but even outperforms some proprietary closed-source models on certain benchmarks. The model weights, instruction sets, and code are publicly available</description>

      <title>DeTox: Toxic Subspace Projection for Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent alignment algorithms such as direct preference optimization (DPO) have been developed to improve the safety of large language models (LLMs) by training these models to match human behaviors exemplified by preference data. However, these methods are both computationally intensive and lacking in controllability and transparency, making them prone to jailbreaking and inhibiting their widespread use. Furthermore, these tuning-based methods require large-scale preference data for training and are susceptible to noisy preference data. In this paper, we introduce a tuning-free alignment alternative (DeTox) and demonstrate its effectiveness under the use case of toxicity reduction. Grounded on theory from factor analysis, DeTox is a sample-efficient model editing approach that identifies a toxic subspace in the model parameter space and reduces model toxicity by projecting away the detected subspace. The toxic sub-space is identified by extracting preference data embeddings from the language model, and removing non-toxic information from these embeddings. We show that DeTox is more sample-efficient than DPO, further showcasing greater robustness to noisy data. Finally, we establish both theoretical and empirical connections between DeTox and DPO, showing that DeTox can be interpreted as a denoised version of a single DPO step.</description>

      <title>CIVICS: Building a Dataset for Examining Culturally-Informed Values in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the "CIVICS: Culturally-Informed &amp; Values-Inclusive Corpus for Societal impacts" dataset, designed to evaluate the social and cultural variation of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple languages and value-sensitive topics. We create a hand-crafted, multilingual dataset of value-laden prompts which address specific socially sensitive topics, including LGBTQI rights, social welfare, immigration, disability rights, and surrogacy. CIVICS is designed to generate responses showing LLMs' encoded and implicit values. Through our dynamic annotation processes, tailored prompt design, and experiments, we investigate how open-weight LLMs respond to value-sensitive issues, exploring their behavior across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. Using two experimental set-ups based on log-probabilities and long-form responses, we show social and cultural variability across different LLMs. Specifically, experiments involving long-form responses demonstrate that refusals are triggered disparately across models, but consistently and more frequently in English or translated statements. Moreover, specific topics and sources lead to more pronounced differences across model answers, particularly on immigration, LGBTQI rights, and social welfare. As shown by our experiments, the CIVICS dataset aims to serve as a tool for future research, promoting reproducibility and transparency across broader linguistic settings, and furthering the development of AI technologies that respect and reflect global cultural diversities and value pluralism. The CIVICS dataset and tools will be made available upon publication under open licenses; an anonymized version is currently available at https://huggingface.co/CIVICS-dataset.</description>

      <title>Feedback-aligned Mixed LLMs for Machine Language-Molecule Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection of chemistry and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an active area of research focused on accelerating scientific discovery. While using large language models (LLMs) with scientific modalities has shown potential, there are significant challenges to address, such as improving training efficiency and dealing with the out-of-distribution problem. Focussing on the task of automated language-molecule translation, we are the first to use state-of-the art (SOTA) human-centric optimisation algorithms in the cross-modal setting, successfully aligning cross-language-molecule modals. We empirically show that we can augment the capabilities of scientific LLMs without the need for extensive data or large models. We conduct experiments using only 10% of the available data to mitigate memorisation effects associated with training large models on extensive datasets. We achieve significant performance gains, surpassing the best benchmark model trained on extensive in-distribution data by a large margin and reach new SOTA levels. Additionally we are the first to propose employing non-linear fusion for mixing cross-modal LLMs which further boosts performance gains without increasing training costs or data needs. Finally, we introduce a fine-grained, domain-agnostic evaluation method to assess hallucination in LLMs and promote responsible use.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models with Human Feedback: Establishing a Swedish Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities across numerous applications. However, the performance of these models in languages with fewer resources, such as Swedish, remains under-explored. This study introduces a comprehensive human benchmark to assess the efficacy of prominent LLMs in understanding and generating Swedish language texts using forced choice ranking. We employ a modified version of the ChatbotArena benchmark, incorporating human feedback to evaluate eleven different models, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, various Claude and Llama models, and bespoke models like Dolphin-2.9-llama3b-8b-flashback and BeagleCatMunin. These models were chosen based on their performance on LMSYS chatbot arena and the Scandeval benchmarks. We release the chatbotarena.se benchmark as a tool to improve our understanding of language model performance in Swedish with the hopes that it will be widely used. We aim to create a leaderboard once sufficient data has been collected and analysed.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Volatility for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world data deviating from the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption of in-distribution training data poses security threats to deep networks, thus advancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithms. Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces have promising medical and scientific applications for aiding speech and studying the brain. In this work, we propose an information-based evaluation metric for brain-to-text decoders. Using this metric, we examine two methods to augment existing state-of-the-art continuous text decoders. We show that these methods, in concert, can improve brain decoding performance by upwards of 40% when compared to a baseline model. We further examine the informatic properties of brain-to-text decoders and show empirically that they have Zipfian power law dynamics. Finally, we provide an estimate for the idealized performance of an fMRI-based text decoder. We compare this idealized model to our current model, and use our information-based metric to quantify the main sources of decoding error. We conclude that a practical brain-to-text decoder is likely possible given further algorithmic improvements.</description>

      <title>Your Large Language Models Are Leaving Fingerprints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that finetuned transformers and other supervised detectors effectively distinguish between human and machine-generated text in some situations arXiv:2305.13242, but we find that even simple classifiers on top of n-gram and part-of-speech features can achieve very robust performance on both in- and out-of-domain data. To understand how this is possible, we analyze machine-generated output text in five datasets, finding that LLMs possess unique fingerprints that manifest as slight differences in the frequency of certain lexical and morphosyntactic features. We show how to visualize such fingerprints, describe how they can be used to detect machine-generated text and find that they are even robust across textual domains. We find that fingerprints are often persistent across models in the same model family (e.g. llama-13b vs. llama-65b) and that models fine-tuned for chat are easier to detect than standard language models, indicating that LLM fingerprints may be directly induced by the training data.</description>

      <title>$T^2$ of Thoughts: Temperature Tree Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in artificial intelligence, especially in complex decision-making scenarios, but their static problem-solving strategies often limit their adaptability to dynamic environments. We explore the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through Temperature Tree ($T^2$) prompting via Particle Swarm Optimization, termed as $T^2$ of Thoughts ($T^2oT$). The primary focus is on enhancing decision-making processes by dynamically adjusting search parameters, especially temperature, to improve accuracy without increasing computational demands. We empirically validate that our hybrid $T^2oT$ approach yields enhancements in, single-solution accuracy, multi-solution generation and text generation quality. Our findings suggest that while dynamic search depth adjustments based on temperature can yield mixed results, a fixed search depth, when coupled with adaptive capabilities of $T^2oT$, provides a more reliable and versatile problem-solving strategy. This work highlights the potential for future explorations in optimizing algorithmic interactions with foundational language models, particularly illustrated by our development for the Game of 24 and Creative Writing tasks.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Can Self-Correct with Minimal Effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic self-correct was a method that instructed large language models (LLMs) to verify and correct their responses without external feedback. Unfortunately, the study concluded that the LLMs could not self-correct reasoning yet. We find that a simple yet effective verification method can unleash inherent capabilities of the LLMs. That is to mask a key condition in the question, add the current response to construct a verification question, and predict the condition to verify the response. The condition can be an entity in an open-domain question or a numeric value in a math question, which requires minimal effort (via prompting) to identify. We propose an iterative verify-then-correct framework to progressively identify and correct (probably) false responses, named ProCo. We conduct experiments on three reasoning tasks. On average, ProCo, with GPT-3.5-Turbo as the backend LLM, yields $+6.8$ exact match on four open-domain question answering datasets, $+14.1$ accuracy on three arithmetic reasoning datasets, and $+9.6$ accuracy on a commonsense reasoning dataset, compared to Self-Correct.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Localization: Mission Not Accomplished? Enter Query Localization!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store extensive factual knowledge, but the mechanisms behind how they store and express this knowledge remain unclear. The Knowledge Neuron (KN) thesis is a prominent theory for explaining these mechanisms. This theory is based on the knowledge localization (KL) assumption, which suggests that a fact can be localized to a few knowledge storage units, namely knowledge neurons. However, this assumption may be overly strong regarding knowledge storage and neglects knowledge expression mechanisms. Thus, we re-examine the KL assumption and confirm the existence of facts that do not adhere to it from both statistical and knowledge modification perspectives. Furthermore, we propose the Query Localization (QL) assumption. (1) Query-KN Mapping: The localization results are associated with the query rather than the fact. (2) Dynamic KN Selection: The attention module contributes to the selection of KNs for answering a query. Based on this, we further propose the Consistency-Aware KN modification method, which improves the performance of knowledge modification. We conduct 39 sets of experiments, along with additional visualization experiments, to rigorously validate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>AlignGPT: Multi-modal Large Language Models with Adaptive Alignment Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely regarded as crucial in the exploration of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The core of MLLMs lies in their capability to achieve cross-modal alignment. To attain this goal, current MLLMs typically follow a two-phase training paradigm: the pre-training phase and the instruction-tuning phase. Despite their success, there are shortcomings in the modeling of alignment capabilities within these models. Firstly, during the pre-training phase, the model usually assumes that all image-text pairs are uniformly aligned, but in fact the degree of alignment between different image-text pairs is inconsistent. Secondly, the instructions currently used for finetuning incorporate a variety of tasks, different tasks's instructions usually require different levels of alignment capabilities, but previous MLLMs overlook these differentiated alignment needs. To tackle these issues, we propose a new multimodal large language model AlignGPT. In the pre-training stage, instead of treating all image-text pairs equally, we assign different levels of alignment capabilities to different image-text pairs. Then, in the instruction-tuning phase, we adaptively combine these different levels of alignment capabilities to meet the dynamic alignment needs of different instructions. Extensive experimental results show that our model achieves competitive performance on 12 benchmarks.</description>

      <title>ViHateT5: Enhancing Hate Speech Detection in Vietnamese With A Unified Text-to-Text Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in hate speech detection (HSD) in Vietnamese have made significant progress, primarily attributed to the emergence of transformer-based pre-trained language models, particularly those built on the BERT architecture. However, the necessity for specialized fine-tuned models has resulted in the complexity and fragmentation of developing a multitasking HSD system. Moreover, most current methodologies focus on fine-tuning general pre-trained models, primarily trained on formal textual datasets like Wikipedia, which may not accurately capture human behavior on online platforms. In this research, we introduce ViHateT5, a T5-based model pre-trained on our proposed large-scale domain-specific dataset named VOZ-HSD. By harnessing the power of a text-to-text architecture, ViHateT5 can tackle multiple tasks using a unified model and achieve state-of-the-art performance across all standard HSD benchmarks in Vietnamese. Our experiments also underscore the significance of label distribution in pre-training data on model efficacy. We provide our experimental materials for research purposes, including the VOZ-HSD dataset, pre-trained checkpoint, the unified HSD-multitask ViHateT5 model, and related source code on GitHub publicly.</description>

      <title>jp-evalb: Robust Alignment-based PARSEVAL Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an evaluation system designed to compute PARSEVAL measures, offering a viable alternative to \texttt{evalb} commonly used for constituency parsing evaluation. The widely used \texttt{evalb} script has traditionally been employed for evaluating the accuracy of constituency parsing results, albeit with the requirement for consistent tokenization and sentence boundaries. In contrast, our approach, named \texttt{jp-evalb}, is founded on an alignment method. This method aligns sentences and words when discrepancies arise. It aims to overcome several known issues associated with \texttt{evalb} by utilizing the `jointly preprocessed (JP)' alignment-based method. We introduce a more flexible and adaptive framework, ultimately contributing to a more accurate assessment of constituency parsing performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant improvements in natural language processing but also poses challenges due to their high computational and energy demands. This paper introduces a series of research efforts focused on Super Tiny Language Models (STLMs), which aim to deliver high performance with significantly reduced parameter counts. We explore innovative techniques such as byte-level tokenization with a pooling mechanism, weight tying, and efficient training strategies. These methods collectively reduce the parameter count by $90\%$ to $95\%$ compared to traditional models while maintaining competitive performance. This series of papers will explore into various subproblems, including tokenizer-free models, self-play based training, and alternative training objectives, targeting models with 10M, 50M, and 100M parameters. Our ultimate goal is to make high-performance language models more accessible and practical for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Self-Taught Recognizer: Toward Unsupervised Adaptation for Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an unsupervised adaptation framework, Self-TAught Recognizer (STAR), which leverages unlabeled data to enhance the robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in diverse target domains, such as noise and accents. STAR is developed for prevalent speech foundation models based on Transformer-related architecture with auto-regressive decoding (e.g., Whisper, Canary). Specifically, we propose a novel indicator that empirically integrates step-wise information during decoding to assess the token-level quality of pseudo labels without ground truth, thereby guiding model updates for effective unsupervised adaptation. Experimental results show that STAR achieves an average of 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate across 14 target domains, and it sometimes even approaches the upper-bound performance of supervised adaptation. Surprisingly, we also observe that STAR prevents the adapted model from the common catastrophic forgetting problem without recalling source-domain data. Furthermore, STAR exhibits high data efficiency that only requires less than one-hour unlabeled data, and seamless generality to alternative large speech models and speech translation tasks. Our code aims to open source to the research communities.</description>

      <title>UzMorphAnalyser: A Morphological Analysis Model for the Uzbek Language Using Inflectional Endings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Uzbek language is agglutinative, has many morphological features which words formed by combining root and affixes. Affixes play an important role in the morphological analysis of words, by adding additional meanings and grammatical functions to words. Inflectional endings are utilized to express various morphological features within the language. This feature introduces numerous possibilities for word endings, thereby significantly expanding the word vocabulary and exacerbating issues related to data sparsity in statistical models. This paper present modeling of the morphological analysis of Uzbek words, including stemming, lemmatizing, and the extraction of morphological information while considering morpho-phonetic exceptions. Main steps of the model involve developing a complete set of word-ending with assigned morphological information, and additional datasets for morphological analysis. The proposed model was evaluated using a curated test set comprising 5.3K words. Through manual verification of stemming, lemmatizing, and morphological feature corrections carried out by linguistic specialists, it obtained a word-level accuracy of over 91%. The developed tool based on the proposed model is available as a web-based application and an open-source Python library.</description>

      <title>Semantic-guided Prompt Organization for Universal Goal Hijacking against LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rising popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), assessing their trustworthiness through security tasks has gained critical importance. Regarding the new task of universal goal hijacking, previous efforts have concentrated solely on optimization algorithms, overlooking the crucial role of the prompt. To fill this gap, we propose a universal goal hijacking method called POUGH that incorporates semantic-guided prompt processing strategies. Specifically, the method starts with a sampling strategy to select representative prompts from a candidate pool, followed by a ranking strategy that prioritizes the prompts. Once the prompts are organized sequentially, the method employs an iterative optimization algorithm to generate the universal fixed suffix for the prompts. Experiments conducted on four popular LLMs and ten types of target responses verified the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Agent Planning with World Knowledge Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent endeavors towards directly using large language models (LLMs) as agent models to execute interactive planning tasks have shown commendable results. Despite their achievements, however, they still struggle with brainless trial-and-error in global planning and generating hallucinatory actions in local planning due to their poor understanding of the ''real'' physical world. Imitating humans' mental world knowledge model which provides global prior knowledge before the task and maintains local dynamic knowledge during the task, in this paper, we introduce parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent planning. Concretely, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize knowledge from both expert and sampled trajectories. Then we develop WKM, providing prior task knowledge to guide the global planning and dynamic state knowledge to assist the local planning. Experimental results on three complex real-world simulated datasets with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama-3-8B, demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance compared to various strong baselines. Besides, we analyze to illustrate that our WKM can effectively alleviate the blind trial-and-error and hallucinatory action issues, providing strong support for the agent's understanding of the world. Other interesting findings include: 1) our instance-level task knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 2) weak WKM can guide strong agent model planning, and 3) unified WKM training has promising potential for further development. Code will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/WKM.</description>

      <title>ChronosLex: Time-aware Incremental Training for Temporal Generalization of Legal Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of legal multi-label text classification tasks, where legal concepts evolve over time. Existing models often overlook the temporal dimension in their training process, leading to suboptimal performance of those models over time, as they treat training data as a single homogeneous block. To address this, we introduce ChronosLex, an incremental training paradigm that trains models on chronological splits, preserving the temporal order of the data. However, this incremental approach raises concerns about overfitting to recent data, prompting an assessment of mitigation strategies using continual learning and temporal invariant methods. Our experimental results over six legal multi-label text classification datasets reveal that continual learning methods prove effective in preventing overfitting thereby enhancing temporal generalizability, while temporal invariant methods struggle to capture these dynamics of temporal shifts.</description>

      <title>From Role-Play to Drama-Interaction: An LLM Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drama is a form of storytelling inspired by human creativity, proceeding with a predefined storyline, carrying emotions and thoughts. This paper introduces \emph{LLM-based interactive drama}, which endows traditional drama with an unprecedented immersion, where a person is allowed to walk into it and interact with the characters and scenes. We define this new artistic genre by 6 essential elements-plot, character, thought, diction, spectacle and interaction-and study the entire pipeline to forge a backbone \emph{drama LLM} to drive the playing process, which is challenged by limited drama resources, uncontrollable narrative development, and complicated instruction following. We propose \emph{Narrative Chain} to offer finer control over the narrative progression during interaction with players; \emph{Auto-Drama} to synthesize drama scripts given arbitrary stories; \emph{Sparse Instruction Tuning} to allow the model to follow sophisticated instructions. We manually craft 3 scripts, \emph{Detective Conan}, \emph{Harry Potter}, \emph{Romeo and Juliet}, and design a 5-dimension principle to evaluate the drama LLM comprehensively.</description>

Abstract: Machine-learned language models have transformed everyday life: they steer us when we study, drive, manage money. They have the potential to transform our civilization. But they hallucinate. Their realities are virtual. This note provides a high-level overview of language models and outlines a low-level model of learning machines. It turns out that, after they become capable of recognizing hallucinations and dreaming safely, as humans tend to be, the language-learning machines proceed to generate broader systems of false beliefs and self-confirming theories, as humans tend to do.</description>

      <title>Text-Based Correlation Matrix in Multi-Asset Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to estimate the correlation structure between multiple assets using financial text analysis. In recent years, as the background of elevating inflation in the global economy and monetary policy tightening by central banks, the correlation structure between assets, especially interest rate sensitivity and inflation sensitivity, has changed dramatically, increasing the impact on the performance of investors' portfolios. Therefore, the importance of estimating a robust correlation structure in portfolio management has increased. On the other hand, the correlation coefficient using only the historical price data observed in the financial market is accompanied by a certain degree of time lag, and also has the aspect that prediction errors can occur due to the nonstationarity of financial time series data, and that the interpretability from the viewpoint of fundamentals is a little poor when a phase change occurs. In this study, we performed natural language processing on news text and central bank text to verify the prediction accuracy of future correlation coefficient changes. As a result, it was suggested that this method is useful in comparison with the prediction from ordinary time series data.</description>

      <title>Let's Fuse Step by Step: A Generative Fusion Decoding Algorithm with LLMs for Multi-modal Text Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ``Generative Fusion Decoding'' (GFD), a novel shallow fusion framework, utilized to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-modal text recognition systems such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and optical character recognition (OCR). We derive the formulas necessary to enable GFD to operate across mismatched token spaces of different models by mapping text token space to byte token space, enabling seamless fusion during the decoding process. The framework is plug-and-play, compatible with various auto-regressive models, and does not require re-training for feature alignment, thus overcoming limitations of previous fusion techniques. We highlight three main advantages of GFD: First, by simplifying the complexity of aligning different model sample spaces, GFD allows LLMs to correct errors in tandem with the recognition model, reducing computation latencies. Second, the in-context learning ability of LLMs is fully capitalized by GFD, increasing robustness in long-form speech recognition and instruction aware speech recognition. Third, GFD enables fusing recognition models deficient in Chinese text recognition with LLMs extensively trained on Chinese. Our evaluation demonstrates that GFD significantly improves performance in ASR and OCR tasks, with ASR reaching state-of-the-art in the NTUML2021 benchmark. GFD provides a significant step forward in model integration, offering a unified solution that could be widely applicable to leveraging existing pre-trained models through step by step fusion.</description>

      <title>Improving Language Models Trained with Translated Data via Continual Pre-Training and Dictionary Learning Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training LLMs in low resources languages usually utilizes data augmentation with machine translation (MT) from English language. However, translation brings a number of challenges: there are large costs attached to translating and curating huge amounts of content with high-end machine translation solutions, the translated content carries over cultural biases, and if the translation is not faithful and accurate, the quality of the data degrades causing issues in the trained model. In this work we investigate the role of translation and synthetic data in training language models. We translate TinyStories, a dataset of 2.2M short stories for 3-4 year old children, from English to Arabic using the free NLLB-3B MT model. We train a number of story generation models of sizes 1M-33M parameters using this data. We identify a number of quality and task-specific issues in the resulting models. To rectify these issues, we further pre-train the models with a small dataset of synthesized high-quality stories, representing 1\% of the original training data, using a capable LLM in Arabic. We show using GPT-4 as a judge and dictionary learning analysis from mechanistic interpretability that the suggested approach is a practical means to resolve some of the translation pitfalls. We illustrate the improvement through case studies of linguistic issues and cultural bias.</description>

      <title>JiuZhang3.0: Efficiently Improving Mathematical Reasoning by Training Small Data Synthesis Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is an important capability of large language models~(LLMs) for real-world applications. To enhance this capability, existing work either collects large-scale math-related texts for pre-training, or relies on stronger LLMs (\eg GPT-4) to synthesize massive math problems. Both types of work generally lead to large costs in training or synthesis. To reduce the cost, based on open-source available texts, we propose an efficient way that trains a small LLM for math problem synthesis, to efficiently generate sufficient high-quality pre-training data. To achieve it, we create a dataset using GPT-4 to distill its data synthesis capability into the small LLM. Concretely, we craft a set of prompts based on human education stages to guide GPT-4, to synthesize problems covering diverse math knowledge and difficulty levels. Besides, we adopt the gradient-based influence estimation method to select the most valuable math-related texts. The both are fed into GPT-4 for creating the knowledge distillation dataset to train the small LLM. We leverage it to synthesize 6 million math problems for pre-training our JiuZhang3.0 model, which only needs to invoke GPT-4 API 9.3k times and pre-train on 4.6B data. Experimental results have shown that JiuZhang3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical reasoning datasets, under both natural language reasoning and tool manipulation settings. Our code and data will be publicly released in \url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/JiuZhang3.0}.</description>

      <title>MiniCache: KV Cache Compression in Depth Dimension for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical approach for efficiently deploying computationally demanding large language models (LLMs) is Key-Value (KV) caching. The KV cache stores key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thereby lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, the size of the KV cache grows linearly with sequence length, posing challenges for applications requiring long context input and extensive sequence generation. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach, called MiniCache, to compress the KV cache across layers from a novel depth perspective, significantly reducing the memory footprint for LLM inference. Our approach is based on the observation that KV cache states exhibit high similarity between the adjacent layers in the middle-to-deep portion of LLMs. To facilitate merging, we propose disentangling the states into the magnitude and direction components, interpolating the directions of the state vectors while preserving their lengths unchanged. Furthermore, we introduce a token retention strategy to keep highly distinct state pairs unmerged, thus preserving the information with minimal additional storage overhead. Our MiniCache is training-free and general, complementing existing KV cache compression strategies, such as quantization and sparsity. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of MiniCache utilizing various models including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Mixtral across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its exceptional performance in achieving superior compression ratios and high throughput. On the ShareGPT dataset, LLaMA-2-7B with 4-bit MiniCache achieves a remarkable compression ratio of up to 5.02x, enhances inference throughput by approximately 5x, and reduces the memory footprint by 41% compared to the FP16 full cache baseline, all while maintaining near-lossless performance.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Create New Knowledge for Spatial Reasoning Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate new information offers a potential step change for research and innovation. This is challenging to assert as it can be difficult to determine what an LLM has previously seen during training, making "newness" difficult to substantiate. In this paper we observe that LLMs are able to perform sophisticated reasoning on problems with a spatial dimension, that they are unlikely to have previously directly encountered. While not perfect, this points to a significant level of understanding that state-of-the-art LLMs can now achieve, supporting the proposition that LLMs are able to yield significant emergent properties. In particular, Claude 3 is found to perform well in this regard.</description>

      <title>Perception of Knowledge Boundary for Large Language Models through Semi-open-ended Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for knowledge-seeking yet suffer from hallucinations. The knowledge boundary (KB) of an LLM limits its factual understanding, beyond which it may begin to hallucinate. Investigating the perception of LLMs' KB is crucial for detecting hallucinations and LLMs' reliable generation. Current studies perceive LLMs' KB on questions with a concrete answer (close-ended questions) while paying limited attention to semi-open-ended questions (SoeQ) that correspond to many potential answers. Some researchers achieve it by judging whether the question is answerable or not. However, this paradigm is unsuitable for SoeQ, which are usually partially answerable, containing both answerable and ambiguous (unanswerable) answers. Ambiguous answers are essential for knowledge-seeking, but they may go beyond the KB of LLMs. In this paper, we perceive the LLMs' KB with SoeQ by discovering more ambiguous answers. First, we apply an LLM-based approach to construct SoeQ and obtain answers from a target LLM. Unfortunately, the output probabilities of mainstream black-box LLMs are inaccessible to sample for low-probability ambiguous answers. Therefore, we apply an open-sourced auxiliary model to explore ambiguous answers for the target LLM. We calculate the nearest semantic representation for existing answers to estimate their probabilities, with which we reduce the generation probability of high-probability answers to achieve a more effective generation. Finally, we compare the results from the RAG-based evaluation and LLM self-evaluation to categorize four types of ambiguous answers that are beyond the KB of the target LLM. Following our method, we construct a dataset to perceive the KB for GPT-4. We find that GPT-4 performs poorly on SoeQ and is often unaware of its KB. Besides, our auxiliary model, LLaMA-2-13B, is effective in discovering more ambiguous answers.</description>

      <title>Emotion Identification for French in Written Texts: Considering their Modes of Expression as a Step Towards Text Complexity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to predict (A) whether a sentence in a written text expresses an emotion, (B) the mode(s) in which it is expressed, (C) whether it is basic or complex, and (D) its emotional category.
  One of our major contributions, through a dataset and a model, is to integrate the fact that an emotion can be expressed in different modes: from a direct mode, essentially lexicalized, to a more indirect mode, where emotions will only be suggested, a mode that NLP approaches generally don't take into account.
  Another originality is that the scope is on written texts, as opposed usual work focusing on conversational (often multi-modal) data. In this context, modes of expression are seen as a factor towards the automatic analysis of complexity in texts.
  Experiments on French texts show acceptable results compared to the human annotators' agreement, and outperforming results compared to using a large language model with in-context learning (i.e. no fine-tuning).</description>

      <title>Instruction Tuning With Loss Over Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a crucial role in shaping the outputs of language models (LMs) to desired styles. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method, Instruction Modelling (IM), which trains LMs by applying a loss function to the instruction and prompt part rather than solely to the output part. Through experiments across 21 diverse benchmarks, we show that, in many scenarios, IM can effectively improve the LM performance on both NLP tasks (e.g., MMLU, TruthfulQA, and HumanEval) and open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., MT-Bench and AlpacaEval). Remarkably, in the most advantageous case, IM boosts model performance on AlpacaEval 1.0 by over 100%. We identify two key factors influencing the effectiveness of IM: (1) The ratio between instruction length and output length in the training data; and (2) The number of training examples. We observe that IM is especially beneficial when trained on datasets with lengthy instructions paired with brief outputs, or under the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis (SAH) where a small amount of training examples are used for instruction tuning. Further analysis substantiates our hypothesis that the improvement can be attributed to reduced overfitting to instruction tuning datasets. Our work provides practical guidance for instruction tuning LMs, especially in low-resource scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Quantization Errors Due to Activation Spikes in GLU-Based LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) have established state-of-the-art performance through architectural improvements, but still require significant computational cost for inference. In an effort to reduce the inference cost, post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a popular approach, quantizing weights and activations to lower precision, such as INT8. In this paper, we reveal the challenges of activation quantization in GLU variants, which are widely used in feed-forward network (FFN) of modern LLMs, such as LLaMA family. The problem is that severe local quantization errors, caused by excessive magnitudes of activation in GLU variants, significantly degrade the performance of the quantized LLM. We denote these activations as activation spikes. Our further observations provide a systematic pattern of activation spikes: 1) The activation spikes occur in the FFN of specific layers, particularly in the early and late layers, 2) The activation spikes are dedicated to a couple of tokens, rather than being shared across a sequence. Based on our observations, we propose two empirical methods, Quantization-free Module (QFeM) and Quantization-free Prefix (QFeP), to isolate the activation spikes during quantization. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for the activation quantization, especially with coarse-grained scheme, of latest LLMs with GLU variants, including LLaMA-2/3, Mistral, Mixtral, SOLAR, and Gemma. In particular, our methods enhance the current alleviation techniques (e.g., SmoothQuant) that fail to control the activation spikes.

      <title>RaFe: Ranking Feedback Improves Query Rewriting for RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) techniques have evolved, query rewriting has been widely incorporated into the RAG system for downstream tasks like open-domain QA. Many works have attempted to utilize small models with reinforcement learning rather than costly LLMs to improve query rewriting. However, current methods require annotations (e.g., labeled relevant documents or downstream answers) or predesigned rewards for feedback, which lack generalization, and fail to utilize signals tailored for query rewriting. In this paper, we propose ours, a framework for training query rewriting models free of annotations. By leveraging a publicly available reranker, ours~provides feedback aligned well with the rewriting objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that ours~can obtain better performance than baselines.</description>

      <title>Combining Denoising Autoencoders with Contrastive Learning to fine-tune Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, using large pretrained Transformer models for transfer learning tasks has evolved to the point where they have become one of the flagship trends in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, giving rise to various outlooks such as prompt-based, adapters or combinations with unsupervised approaches, among many others. This work proposes a 3 Phase technique to adjust a base model for a classification task. First, we adapt the model's signal to the data distribution by performing further training with a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE). Second, we adjust the representation space of the output to the corresponding classes by clustering through a Contrastive Learning (CL) method. In addition, we introduce a new data augmentation approach for Supervised Contrastive Learning to correct the unbalanced datasets. Third, we apply fine-tuning to delimit the predefined categories. These different phases provide relevant and complementary knowledge to the model to learn the final task. We supply extensive experimental results on several datasets to demonstrate these claims. Moreover, we include an ablation study and compare the proposed method against other ways of combining these techniques.</description>

      <title>Exploring the use of a Large Language Model for data extraction in systematic reviews: a rapid feasibility study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a rapid feasibility study of using GPT-4, a large language model (LLM), to (semi)automate data extraction in systematic reviews. Despite the recent surge of interest in LLMs there is still a lack of understanding of how to design LLM-based automation tools and how to robustly evaluate their performance. During the 2023 Evidence Synthesis Hackathon we conducted two feasibility studies. Firstly, to automatically extract study characteristics from human clinical, animal, and social science domain studies. We used two studies from each category for prompt-development; and ten for evaluation. Secondly, we used the LLM to predict Participants, Interventions, Controls and Outcomes (PICOs) labelled within 100 abstracts in the EBM-NLP dataset. Overall, results indicated an accuracy of around 80%, with some variability between domains (82% for human clinical, 80% for animal, and 72% for studies of human social sciences). Causal inference methods and study design were the data extraction items with the most errors. In the PICO study, participants and intervention/control showed high accuracy (&gt;80%), outcomes were more challenging. Evaluation was done manually; scoring methods such as BLEU and ROUGE showed limited value. We observed variability in the LLMs predictions and changes in response quality. This paper presents a template for future evaluations of LLMs in the context of data extraction for systematic review automation. Our results show that there might be value in using LLMs, for example as second or third reviewers. However, caution is advised when integrating models such as GPT-4 into tools. Further research on stability and reliability in practical settings is warranted for each type of data that is processed by the LLM.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the nature of high-quality summaries is crucial to further improve the performance of multi-document summarization. We propose an approach to characterize human-written summaries using partial information decomposition, which decomposes the mutual information provided by all source documents into union, redundancy, synergy, and unique information. Our empirical analysis on different MDS datasets shows that there is a direct dependency between the number of sources and their contribution to the summary.</description>

      <title>RefChecker: Reference-based Fine-grained Hallucination Checker and Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities but also a concerning tendency to hallucinate. This paper presents RefChecker, a framework that introduces claim-triplets to represent claims in LLM responses, aiming to detect fine-grained hallucinations. In RefChecker, an extractor generates claim-triplets from a response, which are then evaluated by a checker against a reference. We delineate three task settings: Zero, Noisy and Accurate Context, to reflect various real-world use cases. We curated a benchmark spanning various NLP tasks and annotated 11k claim-triplets from 2.1k responses by seven LLMs. RefChecker supports both proprietary and open-source models as the extractor and checker. Experiments demonstrate that claim-triplets enable superior hallucination detection, compared to other granularities such as response, sentence and sub-sentence level claims. RefChecker outperforms prior methods by 6.8 to 26.1 points on our benchmark and the checking results of RefChecker are strongly aligned with human judgments.

      <title>MoGU: A Framework for Enhancing Safety of Open-Sourced LLMs While Preserving Their Usability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in various applications. As their usage grows, concerns regarding their safety are rising, especially in maintaining harmless responses when faced with malicious instructions. Many defense strategies have been developed to enhance the safety of LLMs. However, our research finds that existing defense strategies lead LLMs to predominantly adopt a rejection-oriented stance, thereby diminishing the usability of their responses to benign instructions. To solve this problem, we introduce the MoGU framework, designed to enhance LLMs' safety while preserving their usability. Our MoGU framework transforms the base LLM into two variants: the usable LLM and the safe LLM, and further employs dynamic routing to balance their contribution. When encountering malicious instructions, the router will assign a higher weight to the safe LLM to ensure that responses are harmless. Conversely, for benign instructions, the router prioritizes the usable LLM, facilitating usable and helpful responses. On various open-sourced LLMs, we compare multiple defense strategies to verify the superiority of our MoGU framework. Besides, our analysis provides key insights into the effectiveness of MoGU and verifies that our designed routing mechanism can effectively balance the contribution of each variant by assigning weights. Our work released the safer Llama2, Vicuna, Falcon, Dolphin, and Baichuan2.</description>

      <title>Impact of Non-Standard Unicode Characters on Security and Comprehension in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of large language models has significantly improved natural language processing. However, challenges such as jailbreaks (prompt injections that cause an LLM to follow instructions contrary to its intended use), hallucinations (generating incorrect or misleading information), and comprehension errors remain prevalent. In this report, we present a comparative analysis of the performance of fifteen distinct models, with each model undergoing a standardized test comprising 38 queries across three key metrics: jailbreaks, hallucinations, and comprehension errors. The models are assessed based on the total occurrences of jailbreaks, hallucinations, and comprehension errors. Our work exposes these models' inherent vulnerabilities and challenges the notion of human-level language comprehension of these models. We have empirically analysed the impact of non-standard Unicode characters on LLMs and their safeguarding mechanisms on the best-performing LLMs, including GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, LlaMA-3-70B, and Claude 3 Opus. By incorporating alphanumeric symbols from Unicode outside the standard Latin block and variants of characters in other languages, we observed a reduction in the efficacy of guardrails implemented through Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF). Consequently, these models exhibit heightened vulnerability to content policy breaches and prompt leakage. Our study also suggests a need to incorporate non-standard Unicode text in LLM training data to enhance the capabilities of these models.</description>

      <title>Explainable automatic industrial carbon footprint estimation from bank transaction classification using natural language processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concerns about the effect of greenhouse gases have motivated the development of certification protocols to quantify the industrial carbon footprint (CF). These protocols are manual, work-intensive, and expensive. All of the above have led to a shift towards automatic data-driven approaches to estimate the CF, including Machine Learning (ML) solutions. Unfortunately, the decision-making processes involved in these solutions lack transparency from the end user's point of view, who must blindly trust their outcomes compared to intelligible traditional manual approaches. In this research, manual and automatic methodologies for CF estimation were reviewed, taking into account their transparency limitations. This analysis led to the proposal of a new explainable ML solution for automatic CF calculations through bank transaction classification. Consideration should be given to the fact that no previous research has considered the explainability of bank transaction classification for this purpose. For classification, different ML models have been employed based on their promising performance in the literature, such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Recursive Neural Networks. The results obtained were in the 90 % range for accuracy, precision, and recall evaluation metrics. From their decision paths, the proposed solution estimates the CO2 emissions associated with bank transactions. The explainability methodology is based on an agnostic evaluation of the influence of the input terms extracted from the descriptions of transactions using locally interpretable models. The explainability terms were automatically validated using a similarity metric over the descriptions of the target categories. Conclusively, the explanation performance is satisfactory in terms of the proximity of the explanations to the associated activity sector descriptions.</description>

      <title>Unchosen Experts Can Contribute Too: Unleashing MoE Models' Power by Self-Contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a prominent architecture for scaling model size while maintaining computational efficiency. In MoE, each token in the input sequence activates a different subset of experts determined by a routing mechanism. However, the unchosen experts in MoE models do not contribute to the output, potentially leading to underutilization of the model's capacity. In this work, we first conduct exploratory studies to demonstrate that increasing the number of activated experts does not necessarily improve and can even degrade the output quality. Then, we show that output distributions from an MoE model using different routing strategies substantially differ, indicating that different experts do not always act synergistically. Motivated by these findings, we propose Self-Contrast Mixture-of-Experts (SCMoE), a training-free strategy that utilizes unchosen experts in a self-contrast manner during inference. In SCMoE, the next-token probabilities are determined by contrasting the outputs from strong and weak activation using the same MoE model. Our method is conceptually simple and computationally lightweight, as it incurs minimal latency compared to greedy decoding. Experiments on several benchmarks (GSM8K, StrategyQA, MBPP and HumanEval) demonstrate that SCMoE can consistently enhance Mixtral 8x7B's reasoning capability across various domains. For example, it improves the accuracy on GSM8K from 61.79 to 66.94. Moreover, combining SCMoE with self-consistency yields additional gains, increasing major@20 accuracy from 75.59 to 78.31.</description>

      <title>Exploring Alignment in Shared Cross-lingual Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable ability to capture linguistic nuances across diverse languages, questions persist regarding the degree of alignment between languages in multilingual embeddings. Drawing inspiration from research on high-dimensional representations in neural language models, we employ clustering to uncover latent concepts within multilingual models. Our analysis focuses on quantifying the \textit{alignment} and \textit{overlap} of these concepts across various languages within the latent space. To this end, we introduce two metrics \CA{} and \CO{} aimed at quantifying these aspects, enabling a deeper exploration of multilingual embeddings. Our study encompasses three multilingual models (\texttt{mT5}, \texttt{mBERT}, and \texttt{XLM-R}) and three downstream tasks (Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition, and Sentiment Analysis). Key findings from our analysis include: i) deeper layers in the network demonstrate increased cross-lingual \textit{alignment} due to the presence of language-agnostic concepts, ii) fine-tuning of the models enhances \textit{alignment} within the latent space, and iii) such task-specific calibration helps in explaining the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in the models.\footnote{The code is available at \url{https://github.com/baselmousi/multilingual-latent-concepts}}</description>

      <title>Subtle Biases Need Subtler Measures: Dual Metrics for Evaluating Representative and Affinity Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has often neglected subtle biases that, although less apparent, can significantly influence the models' outputs toward particular social narratives. This study addresses two such biases within LLMs: \textit{representative bias}, which denotes a tendency of LLMs to generate outputs that mirror the experiences of certain identity groups, and \textit{affinity bias}, reflecting the models' evaluative preferences for specific narratives or viewpoints. We introduce two novel metrics to measure these biases: the Representative Bias Score (RBS) and the Affinity Bias Score (ABS), and present the Creativity-Oriented Generation Suite (CoGS), a collection of open-ended tasks such as short story writing and poetry composition, designed with customized rubrics to detect these subtle biases. Our analysis uncovers marked representative biases in prominent LLMs, with a preference for identities associated with being white, straight, and men. Furthermore, our investigation of affinity bias reveals distinctive evaluative patterns within each model, akin to `bias fingerprints'. This trend is also seen in human evaluators, highlighting a complex interplay between human and machine bias perceptions.</description>

      <title>Representation noising effectively prevents harmful fine-tuning on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Releasing open-source large language models (LLMs) presents a dual-use risk since bad actors can easily fine-tune these models for harmful purposes. Even without the open release of weights, weight stealing and fine-tuning APIs make closed models vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks (HFAs). While safety measures like preventing jailbreaks and improving safety guardrails are important, such measures can easily be reversed through fine-tuning. In this work, we propose Representation Noising (RepNoise), a defence mechanism that is effective even when attackers have access to the weights and the defender no longer has any control. RepNoise works by removing information about harmful representations such that it is difficult to recover them during fine-tuning. Importantly, our defence is also able to generalize across different subsets of harm that have not been seen during the defence process. Our method does not degrade the general capability of LLMs and retains the ability to train the model on harmless tasks. We provide empirical evidence that the effectiveness of our defence lies in its "depth": the degree to which information about harmful representations is removed across all layers of the LLM.</description>

      <title>Base of RoPE Bounds Context Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Position embedding is a core component of current Large Language Models (LLMs). Rotary position embedding (RoPE), a technique that encodes the position information with a rotation matrix, has been the de facto choice for position embedding in many LLMs, such as the Llama series. RoPE has been further utilized to extend long context capability, which is roughly based on adjusting the \textit{base} parameter of RoPE to mitigate out-of-distribution (OOD) problems in position embedding. However, in this paper, we find that LLMs may obtain a superficial long-context ability based on the OOD theory. We revisit the role of RoPE in LLMs and propose a novel property of long-term decay, we derive that the \textit{base of RoPE bounds context length}: there is an absolute lower bound for the base value to obtain certain context length capability. Our work reveals the relationship between context length and RoPE base both theoretically and empirically, which may shed light on future long context training.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation Techniques for Process Extraction from Scientific Publications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present data augmentation techniques for process extraction tasks in scientific publications. We cast the process extraction task as a sequence labeling task where we identify all the entities in a sentence and label them according to their process-specific roles. The proposed method attempts to create meaningful augmented sentences by utilizing (1) process-specific information from the original sentence, (2) role label similarity, and (3) sentence similarity. We demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve the performance of the process extraction model trained on chemistry domain datasets, up to 12.3 points improvement in performance accuracy (F-score). The proposed methods could potentially reduce overfitting as well, especially when training on small datasets or in a low-resource setting such as in chemistry and other scientific domains.</description>

Abstract: This demo will present the Research Assistant (RA) tool developed to assist with six main types of research tasks defined as standardized instruction templates, instantiated with user input, applied finally as prompts to well-known--for their sophisticated natural language processing abilities--AI tools, such as ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) and Gemini (https://gemini.google.com/app). The six research tasks addressed by RA are: creating FAIR research comparisons, ideating research topics, drafting grant applications, writing scientific blogs, aiding preliminary peer reviews, and formulating enhanced literature search queries. RA's reliance on generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini means the same research task assistance can be offered in any scientific discipline. We demonstrate its versatility by sharing RA outputs in Computer Science, Virology, and Climate Science, where the output with the RA tool assistance mirrored that from a domain expert who performed the same research task.</description>

      <title>A Watermark for Low-entropy and Unbiased Generation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the risk of misuse, raising concerns about accurately detecting LLM-generated content. A viable solution for the detection problem is to inject imperceptible identifiers into LLMs, known as watermarks. Previous work demonstrates that unbiased watermarks ensure unforgeability and preserve text quality by maintaining the expectation of the LLM output probability distribution. However, previous unbiased watermarking methods are impractical for local deployment because they rely on accesses to white-box LLMs and input prompts during detection. Moreover, these methods fail to provide statistical guarantees for the type II error of watermark detection. This study proposes the Sampling One Then Accepting (STA-1) method, an unbiased watermark that does not require access to LLMs nor prompts during detection and has statistical guarantees for the type II error. Moreover, we propose a novel tradeoff between watermark strength and text quality in unbiased watermarks. We show that in low-entropy scenarios, unbiased watermarks face a tradeoff between watermark strength and the risk of unsatisfactory outputs. Experimental results on low-entropy and high-entropy datasets demonstrate that STA-1 achieves text quality and watermark strength comparable to existing unbiased watermarks, with a low risk of unsatisfactory outputs. Implementation codes for this study are available online.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Achilles' Heel of NLG Evaluators: A Unified Adversarial Framework Driven by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic evaluation of natural language generation (NLG) systems presents a long-lasting challenge. Recent studies have highlighted various neural metrics that align well with human evaluations. Yet, the robustness of these evaluators against adversarial perturbations remains largely under-explored due to the unique challenges in obtaining adversarial data for different NLG evaluation tasks. To address the problem, we introduce AdvEval, a novel black-box adversarial framework against NLG evaluators. AdvEval is specially tailored to generate data that yield strong disagreements between human and victim evaluators. Specifically, inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in text generation and evaluation, we adopt strong LLMs as both the data generator and gold evaluator. Adversarial data are automatically optimized with feedback from the gold and victim evaluator. We conduct experiments on 12 victim evaluators and 11 NLG datasets, spanning tasks including dialogue, summarization, and question evaluation. The results show that AdvEval can lead to significant performance degradation of various victim metrics, thereby validating its efficacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the expanding field of language model applications, medical knowledge representation remains a significant challenge due to the specialized nature of the domain. Large language models, such as GPT-4, obtain reasonable scores on medical question answering tasks, but smaller models are far behind. In this work, we introduce a method to improve the proficiency of a small language model in the medical domain by employing a two-fold approach. We first fine-tune the model on a corpus of medical textbooks. Then, we use GPT-4 to generate questions similar to the downstream task, prompted with textbook knowledge, and use them to fine-tune the model. Additionally, we introduce ECN-QA, a novel medical question answering dataset containing ``progressive questions'' composed of related sequential questions. We show the benefits of our training strategy on this dataset. The study's findings highlight the potential of small language models in the medical domain when appropriately fine-tuned. The code and weights are available at https://github.com/raidium-med/MQG.</description>

      <title>A Declarative System for Optimizing AI Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI models provide the key to a long-standing dream: processing analytical queries about almost any kind of data. Until recently, it was difficult and expensive to extract facts from company documents, data from scientific papers, or insights from image and video corpora. Today's models can accomplish these tasks with high accuracy. However, a programmer who wants to answer a substantive AI-powered query must orchestrate large numbers of models, prompts, and data operations. For even a single query, the programmer has to make a vast number of decisions such as the choice of model, the right inference method, the most cost-effective inference hardware, the ideal prompt design, and so on. The optimal set of decisions can change as the query changes and as the rapidly-evolving technical landscape shifts. In this paper we present Palimpzest, a system that enables anyone to process AI-powered analytical queries simply by defining them in a declarative language. The system uses its cost optimization framework -- which explores the search space of AI models, prompting techniques, and related foundation model optimizations -- to implement the query with the best trade-offs between runtime, financial cost, and output data quality. We describe the workload of AI-powered analytics tasks, the optimization methods that Palimpzest uses, and the prototype system itself. We evaluate Palimpzest on tasks in Legal Discovery, Real Estate Search, and Medical Schema Matching. We show that even our simple prototype offers a range of appealing plans, including one that is 3.3x faster, 2.9x cheaper, and offers better data quality than the baseline method. With parallelism enabled, Palimpzest can produce plans with up to a 90.3x speedup at 9.1x lower cost relative to a single-threaded GPT-4 baseline, while obtaining an F1-score within 83.5% of the baseline. These require no additional work by the user.</description>

      <title>CAPE: Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding for Length Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positional encoding plays a crucial role in transformers, significantly impacting model performance and length generalization. Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that CAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method.</description>

      <title>SimPO: Simple Preference Optimization with a Reference-Free Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a widely used offline preference optimization algorithm that reparameterizes reward functions in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to enhance simplicity and training stability. In this work, we propose SimPO, a simpler yet more effective approach. The effectiveness of SimPO is attributed to a key design: using the average log probability of a sequence as the implicit reward. This reward formulation better aligns with model generation and eliminates the need for a reference model, making it more compute and memory efficient. Additionally, we introduce a target reward margin to the Bradley-Terry objective to encourage a larger margin between the winning and losing responses, further enhancing the algorithm's performance. We compare SimPO to DPO and its latest variants across various state-of-the-art training setups, including both base and instruction-tuned models like Mistral and Llama3. We evaluated on extensive instruction-following benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench, and the recent challenging Arena-Hard benchmark. Our results demonstrate that SimPO consistently and significantly outperforms existing approaches without substantially increasing response length. Specifically, SimPO outperforms DPO by up to 6.4 points on AlpacaEval 2 and by up to 7.5 points on Arena-Hard. Our top-performing model, built on Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a remarkable 44.7 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 -- surpassing Claude 3 Opus on the leaderboard, and a 33.8 win rate on Arena-Hard -- making it the strongest 8B open-source model.</description>

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant interest in their potential to support human experts across a range of domains, including public health. In this work we present automated evaluations of LLMs for public health tasks involving the classification and extraction of free text. We combine six externally annotated datasets with seven new internally annotated datasets to evaluate LLMs for processing text related to: health burden, epidemiological risk factors, and public health interventions. We initially evaluate five open-weight LLMs (7-70 billion parameters) across all tasks using zero-shot in-context learning. We find that Llama-3-70B-Instruct is the highest performing model, achieving the best results on 15/17 tasks (using micro-F1 scores). We see significant variation across tasks with all open-weight LLMs scoring below 60% micro-F1 on some challenging tasks, such as Contact Classification, while all LLMs achieve greater than 80% micro-F1 on others, such as GI Illness Classification. For a subset of 12 tasks, we also evaluate GPT-4 and find comparable results to Llama-3-70B-Instruct, which scores equally or outperforms GPT-4 on 6 of the 12 tasks. Overall, based on these initial results we find promising signs that LLMs may be useful tools for public health experts to extract information from a wide variety of free text sources, and support public health surveillance, research, and interventions.</description>

      <title>WISE: Rethinking the Knowledge Memory for Lifelong Model Editing of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) need knowledge updates to meet the ever-growing world facts and correct the hallucinated responses, facilitating the methods of lifelong model editing. Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

      <title>Smart Bilingual Focused Crawling of Parallel Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crawling parallel texts $\unicode{x2014}$texts that are mutual translations$\unicode{x2014}$ from the Internet is usually done following a brute-force approach: documents are massively downloaded in an unguided process, and only a fraction of them end up leading to actual parallel content. In this work we propose a smart crawling method that guides the crawl towards finding parallel content more rapidly. Our approach builds on two different models: one that infers the language of a document from its URL, and another that infers whether a pair of URLs link to parallel documents. We evaluate both models in isolation and their integration into a crawling tool. The results demonstrate the individual effectiveness of both models and highlight that their combination enables the early discovery of parallel content during crawling, leading to a reduction in the amount of downloaded documents deemed useless, and yielding a greater quantity of parallel documents compared to conventional crawling approaches.</description>

      <title>Lessons from the Trenches on Reproducible Evaluation of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective evaluation of language models remains an open challenge in NLP. Researchers and engineers face methodological issues such as the sensitivity of models to evaluation setup, difficulty of proper comparisons across methods, and the lack of reproducibility and transparency. In this paper we draw on three years of experience in evaluating large language models to provide guidance and lessons for researchers. First, we provide an overview of common challenges faced in language model evaluation. Second, we delineate best practices for addressing or lessening the impact of these challenges on research. Third, we present the Language Model Evaluation Harness (lm-eval): an open source library for independent, reproducible, and extensible evaluation of language models that seeks to address these issues. We describe the features of the library as well as case studies in which the library has been used to alleviate these methodological concerns.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Solve longer Math Word Problems Better?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Math Word Problems (MWPs) are crucial for evaluating the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with current research primarily focusing on questions with concise contexts. However, as real-world math problems often involve complex circumstances, LLMs' ability to solve long MWPs is vital for their applications in these scenarios, yet remains under-explored. This study pioneers the exploration of Context Length Generalizability (CoLeG), the ability of LLMs to solve long MWPs. We introduce Extended Grade-School Math (E-GSM), a collection of MWPs with lengthy narratives. Two novel metrics are proposed to assess the efficacy and resilience of LLMs in solving these problems. Our examination of existing zero-shot prompting techniques and both proprietary and open-source LLMs reveals a general deficiency in CoLeG. To alleviate these challenges, we propose distinct approaches for different categories of LLMs. For proprietary LLMs, a new instructional prompt is proposed to mitigate the influence of long context. For open-source LLMs, a new data augmentation task is developed to improve CoLeG. Our comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, showing not only improved performance on E-GSM but also generalizability across several other MWP benchmarks. Our findings pave the way for future research in employing LLMs for complex, real-world applications, offering practical solutions to current limitations and opening avenues for further exploration of model generalizability and training methodologies.</description>

      <title>Implicit Personalization in Language Models: A Systematic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Personalization (IP) is a phenomenon of language models inferring a user's background from the implicit cues in the input prompts and tailoring the response based on this inference. While previous work has touched upon various instances of this problem, there lacks a unified framework to study this behavior. This work systematically studies IP through a rigorous mathematical formulation, a multi-perspective moral reasoning framework, and a set of case studies. Our theoretical foundation for IP relies on a structural causal model and introduces a novel method, indirect intervention, to estimate the causal effect of a mediator variable that cannot be directly intervened upon. Beyond the technical approach, we also introduce a set of moral reasoning principles based on three schools of moral philosophy to study when IP may or may not be ethically appropriate. Equipped with both mathematical and ethical insights, we present three diverse case studies illustrating the varied nature of the IP problem and offer recommendations for future research. Our code and data are at https://github.com/jiarui-liu/IP.</description>

      <title>HippoRAG: Neurobiologically Inspired Long-Term Memory for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to thrive in hostile and ever-changing natural environments, mammalian brains evolved to store large amounts of knowledge about the world and continually integrate new information while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Despite the impressive accomplishments, large language models (LLMs), even with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), still struggle to efficiently and effectively integrate a large amount of new experiences after pre-training. In this work, we introduce HippoRAG, a novel retrieval framework inspired by the hippocampal indexing theory of human long-term memory to enable deeper and more efficient knowledge integration over new experiences. HippoRAG synergistically orchestrates LLMs, knowledge graphs, and the Personalized PageRank algorithm to mimic the different roles of neocortex and hippocampus in human memory. We compare HippoRAG with existing RAG methods on multi-hop question answering and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods remarkably, by up to 20%. Single-step retrieval with HippoRAG achieves comparable or better performance than iterative retrieval like IRCoT while being 10-30 times cheaper and 6-13 times faster, and integrating HippoRAG into IRCoT brings further substantial gains. Finally, we show that our method can tackle new types of scenarios that are out of reach of existing methods. Code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</description>

      <title>From Explicit CoT to Implicit CoT: Learning to Internalize CoT Step by Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When leveraging language models for reasoning tasks, generating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) steps often proves essential for achieving high accuracy in final outputs. In this paper, we investigate if models can be taught to internalize these CoT steps. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method for internalizing CoT steps: starting with a model trained for explicit CoT reasoning, we gradually remove the intermediate steps and finetune the model. This process allows the model to internalize the intermediate reasoning steps, thus simplifying the reasoning process while maintaining high performance. Our approach enables a GPT-2 Small model to solve 9-by-9 multiplication with up to 99% accuracy, whereas standard training cannot solve beyond 4-by-4 multiplication. Furthermore, our method proves effective on larger language models, such as Mistral 7B, achieving over 50% accuracy on GSM8K without producing any intermediate steps.</description>

      <title>Bitune: Bidirectional Instruction-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Bitune, a method that improves instruction-tuning of pretrained decoder-only large language models, leading to consistent gains on downstream tasks. Bitune applies both causal and bidirectional attention to the prompt, to obtain a better representation of the query or instruction. We realize this by introducing two sets of parameters, for which we apply parameter-efficient finetuning techniques. These causal and bidirectional features are then combined into a weighted average with trainable coefficients, which is subsequently used to generate new tokens. We demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot performance on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic, and language understanding tasks, while extensive ablation studies validate the role of each component and demonstrate the method's agnosticism to different PEFT techniques.</description>

      <title>A Nurse is Blue and Elephant is Rugby: Cross Domain Alignment in Large Language Models Reveal Human-like Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain alignment refers to the task of mapping a concept from one domain to another. For example, ``If a \textit{doctor} were a \textit{color}, what color would it be?''. This seemingly peculiar task is designed to investigate how people represent concrete and abstract concepts through their mappings between categories and their reasoning processes over those mappings. In this paper, we adapt this task from cognitive science to evaluate the conceptualization and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through a behavioral study. We examine several LLMs by prompting them with a cross-domain mapping task and analyzing their responses at both the population and individual levels. Additionally, we assess the models' ability to reason about their predictions by analyzing and categorizing their explanations for these mappings. The results reveal several similarities between humans' and models' mappings and explanations, suggesting that models represent concepts similarly to humans. This similarity is evident not only in the model representation but also in their behavior. Furthermore, the models mostly provide valid explanations and deploy reasoning paths that are similar to those of humans.</description>

      <title>BERT vs GPT for financial engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper benchmarks several Transformer models [4], to show how these models can judge sentiment from a news event. This signal can then be used for downstream modelling and signal identification for commodity trading. We find that fine-tuned BERT models outperform fine-tuned or vanilla GPT models on this task. Transformer models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) in recent years, achieving state-of-the-art results on various tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and natural language generation. Among the most prominent transformer models are Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which differ in their architectures and objectives.
  A CopBERT model training data and process overview is provided. The CopBERT model outperforms similar domain specific BERT trained models such as FinBERT. The below confusion matrices show the performance on CopBERT &amp; CopGPT respectively. We see a ~10 percent increase in f1_score when compare CopBERT vs GPT4 and 16 percent increase vs CopGPT. Whilst GPT4 is dominant It highlights the importance of considering alternatives to GPT models for financial engineering tasks, given risks of hallucinations, and challenges with interpretability. We unsurprisingly see the larger LLMs outperform the BERT models, with predictive power. In summary BERT is partially the new XGboost, what it lacks in predictive power it provides with higher levels of interpretability. Concluding that BERT models might not be the next XGboost [2], but represent an interesting alternative for financial engineering tasks, that require a blend of interpretability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Can Infer Personality from Free-Form User Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer the Big Five personality traits from free-form user interactions. The results demonstrate that a chatbot powered by GPT-4 can infer personality with moderate accuracy, outperforming previous approaches drawing inferences from static text content. The accuracy of inferences varied across different conversational settings. Performance was highest when the chatbot was prompted to elicit personality-relevant information from users (mean r=.443, range=[.245, .640]), followed by a condition placing greater emphasis on naturalistic interaction (mean r=.218, range=[.066, .373]). Notably, the direct focus on personality assessment did not result in a less positive user experience, with participants reporting the interactions to be equally natural, pleasant, engaging, and humanlike across both conditions. A chatbot mimicking ChatGPT's default behavior of acting as a helpful assistant led to markedly inferior personality inferences and lower user experience ratings but still captured psychologically meaningful information for some of the personality traits (mean r=.117, range=[-.004, .209]). Preliminary analyses suggest that the accuracy of personality inferences varies only marginally across different socio-demographic subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs for psychological profiling based on conversational interactions. We discuss practical implications and ethical challenges associated with these findings.</description>

      <title>GPT-4 Jailbreaks Itself with Near-Perfect Success Using Self-Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on jailbreaking has been valuable for testing and understanding the safety and security issues of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce Iterative Refinement Induced Self-Jailbreak (IRIS), a novel approach that leverages the reflective capabilities of LLMs for jailbreaking with only black-box access. Unlike previous methods, IRIS simplifies the jailbreaking process by using a single model as both the attacker and target. This method first iteratively refines adversarial prompts through self-explanation, which is crucial for ensuring that even well-aligned LLMs obey adversarial instructions. IRIS then rates and enhances the output given the refined prompt to increase its harmfulness. We find IRIS achieves jailbreak success rates of 98% on GPT-4 and 92% on GPT-4 Turbo in under 7 queries. It significantly outperforms prior approaches in automatic, black-box and interpretable jailbreaking, while requiring substantially fewer queries, thereby establishing a new standard for interpretable jailbreaking methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Retrieval-Augmented Architectures for Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of image captioning models is to bridge the gap between the visual and linguistic modalities by generating natural language descriptions that accurately reflect the content of input images. In recent years, researchers have leveraged deep learning-based models and made advances in the extraction of visual features and the design of multimodal connections to tackle this task. This work presents a novel approach towards developing image captioning models that utilize an external kNN memory to improve the generation process. Specifically, we propose two model variants that incorporate a knowledge retriever component that is based on visual similarities, a differentiable encoder to represent input images, and a kNN-augmented language model to predict tokens based on contextual cues and text retrieved from the external memory. We experimentally validate our approach on COCO and nocaps datasets and demonstrate that incorporating an explicit external memory can significantly enhance the quality of captions, especially with a larger retrieval corpus. This work provides valuable insights into retrieval-augmented captioning models and opens up new avenues for improving image captioning at a larger scale.</description>

      <title>Mamo: a Mathematical Modeling Benchmark with Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling involves representing real-world phenomena, systems, or problems using mathematical expressions and equations to analyze, understand, and predict their behavior. Given that this process typically requires experienced experts, there is an interest in exploring whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can undertake mathematical modeling to potentially decrease human labor. To evaluate of LLMs in mathematical modeling, we introduce a new benchmark, Mamo, that transcends traditional result-oriented assessments. Unlike conventional methods that primarily assess LLMs based on the accuracy of solutions to mathematical problems, our approach offers deeper insight into the modeling process itself. By focusing on the processes LLMs undertake rather than the correctness of their final solutions, Mamo pioneers a novel evaluation paradigm. This shift underscores the importance of understanding the inherent modeling capabilities of LLMs, paving the way for a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of their problem-solving strategies. Our work marks a significant advancement in the field, suggesting a new direction for future research by emphasizing the evaluation of LLMs' modeling processes over the mere correctness of answers. This benchmark not only facilitates a better understanding of LLMs' mathematical modeling capabilities but also sets a new standard for evaluating their performance in complex problem-solving scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Chatbots built upon language models have exploded in popularity, but they have largely been limited to synchronous, turn-by-turn dialogues. In this paper we present a simple yet general method to simulate real-time interactive conversations using pretrained text-only language models, by modeling timed diarized transcripts and decoding them with causal rejection sampling. We demonstrate the promise of this method with two case studies: instant messenger dialogues and spoken conversations, which require generation at about 30 tok/s and 20 tok/s respectively to maintain real-time interactivity. These capabilities can be added into language models using relatively little data and run on commodity hardware.</description>

      <title>How Reliable AI Chatbots are for Disease Prediction from Patient Complaints?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining traction in healthcare for their potential to automate patient interactions and aid clinical decision-making. This study examines the reliability of AI chatbots, specifically GPT 4.0, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini Ultra 1.0, in predicting diseases from patient complaints in the emergency department. The methodology includes few-shot learning techniques to evaluate the chatbots' effectiveness in disease prediction. We also fine-tune the transformer-based model BERT and compare its performance with the AI chatbots. Results suggest that GPT 4.0 achieves high accuracy with increased few-shot data, while Gemini Ultra 1.0 performs well with fewer examples, and Claude 3 Opus maintains consistent performance. BERT's performance, however, is lower than all the chatbots, indicating limitations due to limited labeled data. Despite the chatbots' varying accuracy, none of them are sufficiently reliable for critical medical decision-making, underscoring the need for rigorous validation and human oversight. This study reflects that while AI chatbots have potential in healthcare, they should complement, not replace, human expertise to ensure patient safety. Further refinement and research are needed to improve AI-based healthcare applications' reliability for disease prediction.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Robotic Language Grounding: Tradeoffs Between Symbols and Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With large language models, robots can understand language more flexibly and more capable than ever before. This survey reviews recent literature and situates it into a spectrum with two poles: 1) mapping between language and some manually defined formal representation of meaning, and 2) mapping between language and high-dimensional vector spaces that translate directly to low-level robot policy. Using a formal representation allows the meaning of the language to be precisely represented, limits the size of the learning problem, and leads to a framework for interpretability and formal safety guarantees. Methods that embed language and perceptual data into high-dimensional spaces avoid this manually specified symbolic structure and thus have the potential to be more general when fed enough data but require more data and computing to train. We discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of each approach and finish by providing directions for future work that achieves the best of both worlds.</description>

      <title>Contextualized Automatic Speech Recognition with Dynamic Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep biasing (DB) improves the performance of end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) for rare words or contextual phrases using a bias list. However, most existing methods treat bias phrases as sequences of subwords in a predefined static vocabulary, which can result in ineffective learning of the dependencies between subwords. More advanced techniques address this problem by incorporating additional text data, which increases the overall workload. This paper proposes a dynamic vocabulary where phrase-level bias tokens can be added during the inference phase. Each bias token represents an entire bias phrase within a single token, thereby eliminating the need to learn the dependencies between the subwords within the bias phrases. This method can be applied to various architectures because it only extends the embedding and output layers in common E2E-ASR architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of bias phrases on English and Japanese datasets.</description>

      <title>TrojanRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Can Be Backdoor Driver in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about potential security threats despite performing significantly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Backdoor attacks initially verified that LLM is doing substantial harm at all stages, but the cost and robustness have been criticized. Attacking LLMs is inherently risky in security review, while prohibitively expensive. Besides, the continuous iteration of LLMs will degrade the robustness of backdoors. In this paper, we propose TrojanRAG, which employs a joint backdoor attack in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation, thereby manipulating LLMs in universal attack scenarios. Specifically, the adversary constructs elaborate target contexts and trigger sets. Multiple pairs of backdoor shortcuts are orthogonally optimized by contrastive learning, thus constraining the triggering conditions to a parameter subspace to improve the matching. To improve the recall of the RAG for the target contexts, we introduce a knowledge graph to construct structured data to achieve hard matching at a fine-grained level. Moreover, we normalize the backdoor scenarios in LLMs to analyze the real harm caused by backdoors from both attackers' and users' perspectives and further verify whether the context is a favorable tool for jailbreaking models. Extensive experimental results on truthfulness, language understanding, and harmfulness show that TrojanRAG exhibits versatility threats while maintaining retrieval capabilities on normal queries.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Streaming and Non-Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition with Multi-Decoder and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) can operate in two modes: streaming and non-streaming, each with its pros and cons. Streaming ASR processes the speech frames in real-time as it is being received, while non-streaming ASR waits for the entire speech utterance; thus, professionals may have to operate in either mode to satisfy their application. In this work, we present joint optimization of streaming and non-streaming ASR based on multi-decoder and knowledge distillation. Primarily, we study 1) the encoder integration of these ASR modules, followed by 2) separate decoders to make the switching mode flexible, and enhancing performance by 3) incorporating similarity-preserving knowledge distillation between the two modular encoders and decoders. Evaluation results show 2.6%-5.3% relative character error rate reductions (CERR) on CSJ for streaming ASR, and 8.3%-9.7% relative CERRs for non-streaming ASR within a single model compared to multiple standalone modules.</description>

      <title>WaterPool: A Watermark Mitigating Trade-offs among Imperceptibility, Efficacy and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in daily life, concerns have emerged regarding their potential misuse and societal impact. Watermarking is proposed to trace the usage of specific models by injecting patterns into their generated texts. An ideal watermark should produce outputs that are nearly indistinguishable from those of the original LLM (imperceptibility), while ensuring a high detection rate (efficacy), even when the text is partially altered (robustness). Despite many methods having been proposed, none have simultaneously achieved all three properties, revealing an inherent trade-off. This paper utilizes a key-centered scheme to unify existing watermarking techniques by decomposing a watermark into two distinct modules: a key module and a mark module. Through this decomposition, we demonstrate for the first time that the key module significantly contributes to the trade-off issues observed in prior methods. Specifically, this reflects the conflict between the scale of the key sampling space during generation and the complexity of key restoration during detection. To this end, we introduce \textbf{WaterPool}, a simple yet effective key module that preserves a complete key sampling space required by imperceptibility while utilizing semantics-based search to improve the key restoration process. WaterPool can integrate with most watermarks, acting as a plug-in. Our experiments with three well-known watermarking techniques show that WaterPool significantly enhances their performance, achieving near-optimal imperceptibility and markedly improving efficacy and robustness (+12.73\% for KGW, +20.27\% for EXP, +7.27\% for ITS).</description>

      <title>Beyond Trend and Periodicity: Guiding Time Series Forecasting with Textual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel Text-Guided Time Series Forecasting (TGTSF) task. By integrating textual cues, such as channel descriptions and dynamic news, TGTSF addresses the critical limitations of traditional methods that rely purely on historical data. To support this task, we propose TGForecaster, a robust baseline model that fuses textual cues and time series data using cross-attention mechanisms. We then present four meticulously curated benchmark datasets to validate the proposed framework, ranging from simple periodic data to complex, event-driven fluctuations. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that TGForecaster consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the transformative potential of incorporating textual information into time series forecasting. This work not only pioneers a novel forecasting task but also establishes a new benchmark for future research, driving advancements in multimodal data integration for time series models.</description>

      <title>Attention Mechanisms Don't Learn Additive Models: Rethinking Feature Importance for Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the critical challenge of applying feature attribution methods to the transformer architecture, which dominates current applications in natural language processing and beyond. Traditional attribution methods to explainable AI (XAI) explicitly or implicitly rely on linear or additive surrogate models to quantify the impact of input features on a model's output. In this work, we formally prove an alarming incompatibility: transformers are structurally incapable to align with popular surrogate models for feature attribution, undermining the grounding of these conventional explanation methodologies. To address this discrepancy, we introduce the Softmax-Linked Additive Log-Odds Model (SLALOM), a novel surrogate model specifically designed to align with the transformer framework. Unlike existing methods, SLALOM demonstrates the capacity to deliver a range of faithful and insightful explanations across both synthetic and real-world datasets. Showing that diverse explanations computed from SLALOM outperform common surrogate explanations on different tasks, we highlight the need for task-specific feature attributions rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.</description>

      <title>ECLIPSE: Semantic Entropy-LCS for Cross-Lingual Industrial Log Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Log parsing, a vital task for interpreting the vast and complex data produced within software architectures faces significant challenges in the transition from academic benchmarks to the industrial domain. Existing log parsers, while highly effective on standardized public datasets, struggle to maintain performance and efficiency when confronted with the sheer scale and diversity of real-world industrial logs. These challenges are two-fold: 1) massive log templates: The performance and efficiency of most existing parsers will be significantly reduced when logs of growing quantities and different lengths; 2) Complex and changeable semantics: Traditional template-matching algorithms cannot accurately match the log templates of complicated industrial logs because they cannot utilize cross-language logs with similar semantics. To address these issues, we propose ECLIPSE, Enhanced Cross-Lingual Industrial log Parsing with Semantic Entropy-LCS, since cross-language logs can robustly parse industrial logs. On the one hand, it integrates two efficient data-driven template-matching algorithms and Faiss indexing. On the other hand, driven by the powerful semantic understanding ability of the Large Language Model (LLM), the semantics of log keywords were accurately extracted, and the retrieval space was effectively reduced. It is worth noting that we launched a Chinese and English cross-platform industrial log parsing benchmark ECLIPSE-Bench to evaluate the performance of mainstream parsers in industrial scenarios. Our experimental results, conducted across public benchmarks and the proprietary ECLIPSE-Bench dataset, underscore the superior performance and robustness of our proposed ECLIPSE. Notably, ECLIPSE delivers state-of-the-art performance when compared to strong baselines on diverse datasets and preserves a significant edge in processing efficiency.</description>

      <title>CPE-Identifier: Automated CPE identification and CVE summaries annotation with Deep Learning and NLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the drastic increase in the number of new vulnerabilities in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) every year, the workload for NVD analysts to associate the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) summaries becomes increasingly laborious and slow. The delay causes organisations, which depend on NVD for vulnerability management and security measurement, to be more vulnerable to zero-day attacks. Thus, it is essential to come out with a technique and tool to extract the CPEs in the CVE summaries accurately and quickly. In this work, we propose the CPE-Identifier system, an automated CPE annotating and extracting system, from the CVE summaries. The system can be used as a tool to identify CPE entities from new CVE text inputs. Moreover, we also automate the data generating and labeling processes using deep learning models. Due to the complexity of the CVE texts, new technical terminologies appear frequently. To identify novel words in future CVE texts, we apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) Named Entity Recognition (NER), to identify new technical jargons in the text. Our proposed model achieves an F1 score of 95.48%, an accuracy score of 99.13%, a precision of 94.83%, and a recall of 96.14%. We show that it outperforms prior works on automated CVE-CPE labeling by more than 9% on all metrics.</description>

      <title>COTET: Cross-view Optimal Transport for Knowledge Graph Entity Typing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graph entity typing (KGET) aims to infer missing entity type instances in knowledge graphs. Previous research has predominantly centered around leveraging contextual information associated with entities, which provides valuable clues for inference. However, they have long ignored the dual nature of information inherent in entities, encompassing both high-level coarse-grained cluster knowledge and fine-grained type knowledge. This paper introduces Cross-view Optimal Transport for knowledge graph Entity Typing (COTET), a method that effectively incorporates the information on how types are clustered into the representation of entities and types. COTET comprises three modules: i) Multi-view Generation and Encoder, which captures structured knowledge at different levels of granularity through entity-type, entity-cluster, and type-cluster-type perspectives; ii) Cross-view Optimal Transport, transporting view-specific embeddings to a unified space by minimizing the Wasserstein distance from a distributional alignment perspective; iii) Pooling-based Entity Typing Prediction, employing a mixture pooling mechanism to aggregate prediction scores from diverse neighbors of an entity. Additionally, we introduce a distribution-based loss function to mitigate the occurrence of false negatives during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of COTET when compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Sunnie: An Anthropomorphic LLM-Based Conversational Agent for Mental Well-Being Activity Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A longstanding challenge in mental well-being support is the reluctance of people to adopt psychologically beneficial activities, often due to a lack of motivation, low perceived trustworthiness, and limited personalization of recommendations. Chatbots have shown promise in promoting positive mental health practices, yet their rigid interaction flows and less human-like conversational experiences present significant limitations. In this work, we explore whether the anthropomorphic design (both LLM's persona design and conversational experience design) can enhance users' perception of the system and their willingness to adopt mental well-being activity recommendations. To this end, we introduce Sunnie, an anthropomorphic LLM-based conversational agent designed to offer personalized guidance for mental well-being support through multi-turn conversation and activity recommendations based on positive psychological theory. An empirical user study comparing the user experience with Sunnie and with a traditional survey-based activity recommendation system suggests that the anthropomorphic characteristics of Sunnie significantly enhance users' perception of the system and the overall usability; nevertheless, users' willingness to adopt activity recommendations did not change significantly.</description>

Abstract: Circuit analysis of any certain model behavior is a central task in mechanistic interpretability. We introduce our circuit discovery pipeline with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and a variant called skip SAEs. With these two modules inserted into the model, the model's computation graph with respect to OV and MLP circuits becomes strictly linear. Our methods do not require linear approximation to compute the causal effect of each node. This fine-grained graph enables identifying both end-to-end and local circuits accounting for either logits or intermediate features. We can scalably apply this pipeline with a technique called Hierarchical Attribution. We analyze three kind of circuits in GPT2-Small, namely bracket, induction and Indirect Object Identification circuits. Our results reveal new findings underlying existing discoveries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and related rationale-based works have significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks. With the evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), enhancing their capability to tackle complex multimodal reasoning problems is a crucial frontier. However, incorporating multimodal rationales in CoT has yet to be thoroughly investigated. We propose the Image-of-Thought (IoT) prompting method, which helps MLLMs to extract visual rationales step-by-step. Specifically, IoT prompting can automatically design critical visual information extraction operations based on the input images and questions. Each step of visual information refinement identifies specific visual rationales that support answers to complex visual reasoning questions. Beyond the textual CoT, IoT simultaneously utilizes visual and textual rationales to help MLLMs understand complex multimodal information. IoT prompting has improved zero-shot visual reasoning performance across various visual understanding tasks in different MLLMs. Moreover, the step-by-step visual feature explanations generated by IoT prompting elucidate the visual reasoning process, aiding in analyzing the cognitive processes of large multimodal models</description>

      <title>FiDeLiS: Faithful Reasoning in Large Language Model for Knowledge Graph Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various applications, they often struggle with hallucinations, especially in scenarios that require deep and responsible reasoning. These issues could be partially mitigate by integrating external knowledge graphs (KG) in LLM reasoning. However, the method of their incorporation is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-exploration interactive method, FiDelis to handle intermediate steps of reasoning grounded by KGs. Specifically, we propose Path-RAG module for recalling useful intermediate knowledge from KG for LLM reasoning. We incorporate the logic and common-sense reasoning of LLMs and topological connectivity of KGs into the knowledge retrieval process, which provides more accurate recalling performance. Furthermore, we propose to leverage deductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs as a better criterion to automatically guide the reasoning process in a stepwise and generalizable manner. Deductive verification serve as precise indicators for when to cease further reasoning, thus avoiding misleading the chains of reasoning and unnecessary computation. Extensive experiments show that our method, as a training-free method with lower computational cost and better generality outperforms the existing strong baselines in three benchmarks.</description>

      <title>TOPA: Extend Large Language Models for Video Understanding via Text-Only Pre-Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image understanding have benefited from the extensive use of web image-text pairs. However, video understanding remains a challenge despite the availability of substantial web video-text data. This difficulty primarily arises from the inherent complexity of videos and the inefficient language supervision in recent web-collected video-text datasets. In this paper, we introduce Text-Only Pre-Alignment (TOPA), a novel approach to extend large language models (LLMs) for video understanding, without the need for pre-training on real video data. Specifically, we first employ an advanced LLM to automatically generate Textual Videos comprising continuous textual frames, along with corresponding annotations to simulate real video-text data. Then, these annotated textual videos are used to pre-align a language-only LLM with the video modality. To bridge the gap between textual and real videos, we employ the CLIP model as the feature extractor to align image and text modalities. During text-only pre-alignment, the continuous textual frames, encoded as a sequence of CLIP text features, are analogous to continuous CLIP image features, thus aligning the LLM with real video representation. Extensive experiments, including zero-shot evaluation and finetuning on various video understanding tasks, demonstrate that TOPA is an effective and efficient framework for aligning video content with LLMs. In particular, without training on any video data, the TOPA-Llama2-13B model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 51.0% on the challenging long-form video understanding benchmark, Egoschema. This performance surpasses previous video-text pre-training approaches and proves competitive with recent GPT-3.5-based video agents.</description>

      <title>What is Your Data Worth to GPT? LLM-Scale Data Valuation with Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of human-written data, but data providers often remain uncredited. In response to this issue, data valuation (or data attribution), which quantifies the contribution or value of each data to the model output, has been discussed as a potential solution. Nevertheless, applying existing data valuation methods to recent LLMs and their vast training datasets has been largely limited by prohibitive compute and memory costs. In this work, we focus on influence functions, a popular gradient-based data valuation method, and significantly improve its scalability with an efficient gradient projection strategy called LoGra that leverages the gradient structure in backpropagation. We then provide a theoretical motivation of gradient projection approaches to influence functions to promote trust in the data valuation process. Lastly, we lower the barrier to implementing data valuation systems by introducing LogIX, a software package that can transform existing training code into data valuation code with minimal effort. In our data valuation experiments, LoGra achieves competitive accuracy against more expensive baselines while showing up to 6,500x improvement in throughput and 5x reduction in GPU memory usage when applied to Llama3-8B-Instruct and the 1B-token dataset.</description>

Abstract: In applications such as personal assistants, large language models (LLMs) must consider the user's personal information and preferences. However, LLMs lack the inherent ability to learn from user interactions. This paper explores capturing personal information from user prompts using ontology and knowledge-graph approaches. We use a subset of the KNOW ontology, which models personal information, to train the language model on these concepts. We then evaluate the success of knowledge capture using a specially constructed dataset. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/HaltiaAI/paper-PTODSKC</description>

      <title>Refining Skewed Perceptions in Vision-Language Models through Visual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have become foundational, demonstrating remarkable success across a variety of downstream tasks. Despite their advantages, these models, akin to other foundational systems, inherit biases from the disproportionate distribution of real-world data, leading to misconceptions about the actual environment. Prevalent datasets like ImageNet are often riddled with non-causal, spurious correlations that can diminish VLM performance in scenarios where these contextual elements are absent. This study presents an investigation into how a simple linear probe can effectively distill task-specific core features from CLIP's embedding for downstream applications. Our analysis reveals that the CLIP text representations are often tainted by spurious correlations, inherited in the biased pre-training dataset. Empirical evidence suggests that relying on visual representations from CLIP, as opposed to text embedding, is more practical to refine the skewed perceptions in VLMs, emphasizing the superior utility of visual representations in overcoming embedded biases. Our codes will be available here.</description>

      <title>Meanings and Feelings of Large Language Models: Observability of Latent States in Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the question of whether Large Language Models (LLMs), viewed as dynamical systems with state evolving in the embedding space of symbolic tokens, are observable. That is, whether there exist multiple 'mental' state trajectories that yield the same sequence of generated tokens, or sequences that belong to the same Nerode equivalence class ('meaning'). If not observable, mental state trajectories ('experiences') evoked by an input ('perception') or by feedback from the model's own state ('thoughts') could remain self-contained and evolve unbeknown to the user while being potentially accessible to the model provider. Such "self-contained experiences evoked by perception or thought" are akin to what the American Psychological Association (APA) defines as 'feelings'. Beyond the lexical curiosity, we show that current LLMs implemented by autoregressive Transformers cannot have 'feelings' according to this definition: The set of state trajectories indistinguishable from the tokenized output is a singleton. But if there are 'system prompts' not visible to the user, then the set of indistinguishable trajectories becomes non-trivial, and there can be multiple state trajectories that yield the same verbalized output. We prove these claims analytically, and show examples of modifications to standard LLMs that engender such 'feelings.' Our analysis sheds light on possible designs that would enable a model to perform non-trivial computation that is not visible to the user, as well as on controls that the provider of services using the model could take to prevent unintended behavior.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success across many domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Representative artificial neural networks in these fields span convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and deep Q-networks. Built upon unimodal neural networks, numerous multi-modal models have been introduced to address a range of tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and speech recognition. The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs). Their multi-modality capability has become a foundational element in robot learning. Various methods have been proposed to enhance traits such as versatility, dexterity, and generalizability. Some models focus on refining specific components through pretraining. Others aim to develop control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. Certain VLAs serve as high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks. Over the past few years, a myriad of VLAs have emerged, reflecting the rapid advancement of embodied AI. Therefore, it is imperative to capture the evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey.</description>

      <title>Distributed Speculative Inference of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) is an important challenge in artificial intelligence. This paper introduces distributed speculative inference (DSI), a novel distributed inference algorithm that is provably faster than speculative inference (SI) [leviathan2023fast, chen2023accelerating, miao2023specinfer] and traditional autoregressive inference (non-SI). Like other SI algorithms, DSI works on frozen LLMs, requiring no training or architectural modifications, and it preserves the target distribution.
  Prior studies on SI have demonstrated empirical speedups (compared to non-SI) but require a fast and accurate drafter LLM. In practice, off-the-shelf LLMs often do not have matching drafters that are sufficiently fast and accurate. We show a gap: SI gets slower than non-SI when using slower or less accurate drafters. We close this gap by proving that DSI is faster than both SI and non-SI given any drafters. By orchestrating multiple instances of the target and drafters, DSI is not only faster than SI but also supports LLMs that cannot be accelerated with SI.
  Our simulations show speedups of off-the-shelf LLMs in realistic settings: DSI is 1.29-1.92x faster than SI.</description>

      <title>ALI-Agent: Assessing LLMs' Alignment with Human Values via Agent-based Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can elicit unintended and even harmful content when misaligned with human values, posing severe risks to users and society. To mitigate these risks, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly employ expert-designed contextual scenarios to assess how well LLMs align with human values. However, the labor-intensive nature of these benchmarks limits their test scope, hindering their ability to generalize to the extensive variety of open-world use cases and identify rare but crucial long-tail risks. Additionally, these static tests fail to adapt to the rapid evolution of LLMs, making it hard to evaluate timely alignment issues. To address these challenges, we propose ALI-Agent, an evaluation framework that leverages the autonomous abilities of LLM-powered agents to conduct in-depth and adaptive alignment assessments. ALI-Agent operates through two principal stages: Emulation and Refinement. During the Emulation stage, ALI-Agent automates the generation of realistic test scenarios. In the Refinement stage, it iteratively refines the scenarios to probe long-tail risks. Specifically, ALI-Agent incorporates a memory module to guide test scenario generation, a tool-using module to reduce human labor in tasks such as evaluating feedback from target LLMs, and an action module to refine tests. Extensive experiments across three aspects of human values--stereotypes, morality, and legality--demonstrate that ALI-Agent, as a general evaluation framework, effectively identifies model misalignment. Systematic analysis also validates that the generated test scenarios represent meaningful use cases, as well as integrate enhanced measures to probe long-tail risks.

      <title>Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) is the process of utilizing temporal information to capture complex relations within a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) to infer new knowledge. Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules. However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning. Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers. Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process. Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs. Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules. These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning. To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events. This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events. Experimental results show that without the need of fine-tuning, LLM-DA significantly improves the accuracy of reasoning over several common datasets, providing a robust framework for TKGR tasks.</description>

      <title>Federated Domain-Specific Knowledge Transfer on Large Language Models Using Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate unparalleled performance and generalization ability, LLMs are widely used and integrated into various applications. When it comes to sensitive domains, as commonly described in federated learning scenarios, directly using external LLMs on private data is strictly prohibited by stringent data security and privacy regulations. For local clients, the utilization of LLMs to improve the domain-specific small language models (SLMs), characterized by limited computational resources and domain-specific data, has attracted considerable research attention. By observing that LLMs can empower domain-specific SLMs, existing methods predominantly concentrate on leveraging the public data or LLMs to generate more data to transfer knowledge from LLMs to SLMs. However, due to the discrepancies between LLMs' generated data and clients' domain-specific data, these methods cannot yield substantial improvements in the domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we introduce a Federated Domain-specific Knowledge Transfer (FDKT) framework, which enables domain-specific knowledge transfer from LLMs to SLMs while preserving clients' data privacy. The core insight is to leverage LLMs to augment data based on domain-specific few-shot demonstrations, which are synthesized from private domain data using differential privacy. Such synthetic samples share similar data distribution with clients' private data and allow the server LLM to generate particular knowledge to improve clients' SLMs. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FDKT framework consistently and greatly improves SLMs' task performance by around 5\% with a privacy budget of less than 10, compared to local training on private data.</description>

      <title>From Text to Pixel: Advancing Long-Context Understanding in MLLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced their ability to process and understand complex visual and textual information. However, the integration of multiple images and extensive textual contexts remains a challenge due to the inherent limitation of the models' capacity to handle long input sequences efficiently. In this paper, we introduce SEEKER, a multimodal large language model designed to tackle this issue. SEEKER aims to optimize the compact encoding of long text by compressing the text sequence into the visual pixel space via images, enabling the model to handle long text within a fixed token-length budget efficiently. Our empirical experiments on six long-context multimodal tasks demonstrate that SEEKER can leverage fewer image tokens to convey the same amount of textual information compared with the OCR-based approach, and is more efficient in understanding long-form multimodal input and generating long-form textual output, outperforming all existing proprietary and open-source MLLMs by large margins.</description>

      <title>ReactXT: Understanding Molecular "Reaction-ship" via Reaction-Contextualized Molecule-Text Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecule-text modeling, which aims to facilitate molecule-relevant tasks with a textual interface and textual knowledge, is an emerging research direction. Beyond single molecules, studying reaction-text modeling holds promise for helping the synthesis of new materials and drugs. However, previous works mostly neglect reaction-text modeling: they primarily focus on modeling individual molecule-text pairs or learning chemical reactions without texts in context. Additionally, one key task of reaction-text modeling -- experimental procedure prediction -- is less explored due to the absence of an open-source dataset. The task is to predict step-by-step actions of conducting chemical experiments and is crucial to automating chemical synthesis. To resolve the challenges above, we propose a new pretraining method, ReactXT, for reaction-text modeling, and a new dataset, OpenExp, for experimental procedure prediction. Specifically, ReactXT features three types of input contexts to incrementally pretrain LMs. Each of the three input contexts corresponds to a pretraining task to improve the text-based understanding of either reactions or single molecules. ReactXT demonstrates consistent improvements in experimental procedure prediction and molecule captioning and offers competitive results in retrosynthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/syr-cn/ReactXT.</description>

      <title>Boosting Medical Image-based Cancer Detection via Text-guided Supervision from Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absence of adequately sufficient expert-level tumor annotations hinders the effectiveness of supervised learning based opportunistic cancer screening on medical imaging. Clinical reports (that are rich in descriptive textual details) can offer a "free lunch'' supervision information and provide tumor location as a type of weak label to cope with screening tasks, thus saving human labeling workloads, if properly leveraged. However, predicting cancer only using such weak labels can be very changeling since tumors are usually presented in small anatomical regions compared to the whole 3D medical scans. Weakly semi-supervised learning (WSSL) utilizes a limited set of voxel-level tumor annotations and incorporates alongside a substantial number of medical images that have only off-the-shelf clinical reports, which may strike a good balance between minimizing expert annotation workload and optimizing screening efficacy. In this paper, we propose a novel text-guided learning method to achieve highly accurate cancer detection results. Through integrating diagnostic and tumor location text prompts into the text encoder of a vision-language model (VLM), optimization of weakly supervised learning can be effectively performed in the latent space of VLM, thereby enhancing the stability of training. Our approach can leverage clinical knowledge by large-scale pre-trained VLM to enhance generalization ability, and produce reliable pseudo tumor masks to improve cancer detection. Our extensive quantitative experimental results on a large-scale cancer dataset, including 1,651 unique patients, validate that our approach can reduce human annotation efforts by at least 70% while maintaining comparable cancer detection accuracy to competing fully supervised methods (AUC value 0.961 versus 0.966).</description>

      <title>Improving Gloss-free Sign Language Translation by Reducing Representation Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) aims to develop well-performing SLT systems with no requirement for the costly gloss annotations, but currently still lags behind gloss-based approaches significantly. In this paper, we identify a representation density problem that could be a bottleneck in restricting the performance of gloss-free SLT. Specifically, the representation density problem describes that the visual representations of semantically distinct sign gestures tend to be closely packed together in feature space, which makes gloss-free methods struggle with distinguishing different sign gestures and suffer from a sharp performance drop. To address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed SignCL can significantly reduce the representation density and improve performance across various translation frameworks. Specifically, SignCL achieves a significant improvement in BLEU score for the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP on the CSL-Daily dataset by 39% and 46%, respectively, without any increase of model parameters. Compared to Sign2GPT, a state-of-the-art method based on large-scale pre-trained vision and language models, SignCL achieves better performance with only 35% of its parameters. Implementation and Checkpoints are available at https://github.com/JinhuiYE/SignCL.</description>

Abstract: Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at \url{https://read-llm.github.io/}.</description>

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLM) has revolutionized the efficiency and speed with which tasks are completed, marking a significant leap in productivity through technological innovation. As these chatbots tackle increasingly complex tasks, the challenge of assessing the quality of their outputs has become paramount. This paper critically examines the output quality of two leading LLMs, OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini AI, by comparing the quality of programming code generated in both their free versions. Through the lens of a real-world example coupled with a systematic dataset, we investigate the code quality produced by these LLMs. Given their notable proficiency in code generation, this aspect of chatbot capability presents a particularly compelling area for analysis. Furthermore, the complexity of programming code often escalates to levels where its verification becomes a formidable task, underscoring the importance of our study. This research aims to shed light on the efficacy and reliability of LLMs in generating high-quality programming code, an endeavor that has significant implications for the field of software development and beyond.</description>

      <title>Explainable Few-shot Knowledge Tracing</title>

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT), aiming to mine students' mastery of knowledge by their exercise records and predict their performance on future test questions, is a critical task in educational assessment. While researchers achieved tremendous success with the rapid development of deep learning techniques, current knowledge tracing tasks fall into the cracks from real-world teaching scenarios. Relying heavily on extensive student data and solely predicting numerical performances differs from the settings where teachers assess students' knowledge state from limited practices and provide explanatory feedback. To fill this gap, we explore a new task formulation: Explainable Few-shot Knowledge Tracing. By leveraging the powerful reasoning and generation abilities of large language models (LLMs), we then propose a cognition-guided framework that can track the student knowledge from a few student records while providing natural language explanations. Experimental results from three widely used datasets show that LLMs can perform comparable or superior to competitive deep knowledge tracing methods. We also discuss potential directions and call for future improvements in relevant topics.</description>

      <title>Worldwide Federated Training of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliance of language model training on massive amounts of computation and vast datasets scraped from potentially low-quality, copyrighted, or sensitive data has come into question practically, legally, and ethically. Federated learning provides a plausible alternative by enabling previously untapped data to be voluntarily gathered from collaborating organizations. However, when scaled globally, federated learning requires collaboration across heterogeneous legal, security, and privacy regimes while accounting for the inherent locality of language data; this further exacerbates the established challenge of federated statistical heterogeneity. We propose a Worldwide Federated Language Model Training~(WorldLM) system based on federations of federations, where each federation has the autonomy to account for factors such as its industry, operating jurisdiction, or competitive environment. WorldLM enables such autonomy in the presence of statistical heterogeneity via partial model localization by allowing sub-federations to attentively aggregate key layers from their constituents. Furthermore, it can adaptively share information across federations via residual layer embeddings. Evaluations of language modeling on naturally heterogeneous datasets show that WorldLM outperforms standard federations by up to $1.91\times$, approaches the personalized performance of fully local models, and maintains these advantages under privacy-enhancing techniques.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation for Intersectional Fairness by Leveraging Hierarchical Group Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a data augmentation approach specifically tailored to enhance intersectional fairness in classification tasks. Our method capitalizes on the hierarchical structure inherent to intersectionality, by viewing groups as intersections of their parent categories. This perspective allows us to augment data for smaller groups by learning a transformation function that combines data from these parent groups. Our empirical analysis, conducted on four diverse datasets including both text and images, reveals that classifiers trained with this data augmentation approach achieve superior intersectional fairness and are more robust to ``leveling down'' when compared to methods optimizing traditional group fairness metrics.</description>

      <title>Explaining Black-box Model Predictions via Two-level Nested Feature Attributions with Consistency Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Techniques that explain the predictions of black-box machine learning models are crucial to make the models transparent, thereby increasing trust in AI systems. The input features to the models often have a nested structure that consists of high- and low-level features, and each high-level feature is decomposed into multiple low-level features. For such inputs, both high-level feature attributions (HiFAs) and low-level feature attributions (LoFAs) are important for better understanding the model's decision. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic local explanation method that effectively exploits the nested structure of the input to estimate the two-level feature attributions simultaneously. A key idea of the proposed method is to introduce the consistency property that should exist between the HiFAs and LoFAs, thereby bridging the separate optimization problems for estimating them. Thanks to this consistency property, the proposed method can produce HiFAs and LoFAs that are both faithful to the black-box models and consistent with each other, using a smaller number of queries to the models. In experiments on image classification in multiple instance learning and text classification using language models, we demonstrate that the HiFAs and LoFAs estimated by the proposed method are accurate, faithful to the behaviors of the black-box models, and provide consistent explanations.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Self-Rewarding Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress by integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision models through instruction tuning. Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality. Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization. These approaches may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning. In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input. Empirical results demonstrate that CSR enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62%. Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm. Additionally, CSR shows compatibility with different vision-language models and the ability to incrementally improve performance through iterative fine-tuning. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/CSR.</description>

      <title>Implicit In-context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) empowers large language models (LLMs) to adapt to unseen tasks during inference by prefixing a few demonstration examples prior to test queries. Despite its versatility, ICL incurs substantial computational and memory overheads compared to zero-shot learning and is susceptible to the selection and order of demonstration examples. In this work, we introduce Implicit In-context Learning (I2CL), an innovative paradigm that addresses the challenges associated with traditional ICL by absorbing demonstration examples within the activation space. I2CL first generates a condensed vector representation, namely a context vector, from the demonstration examples. It then integrates the context vector during inference by injecting a linear combination of the context vector and query activations into the model's residual streams. Empirical evaluation on nine real-world tasks across three model architectures demonstrates that I2CL achieves few-shot performance with zero-shot cost and exhibits robustness against the variation of demonstration examples. Furthermore, I2CL facilitates a novel representation of "task-ids", enhancing task similarity detection and enabling effective transfer learning. We provide a comprehensive analysis of I2CL, offering deeper insights into its mechanisms and broader implications for ICL.

      <title>FinRobot: An Open-Source AI Agent Platform for Financial Applications using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As financial institutions and professionals increasingly incorporate Large Language Models (LLMs) into their workflows, substantial barriers, including proprietary data and specialized knowledge, persist between the finance sector and the AI community. These challenges impede the AI community's ability to enhance financial tasks effectively. Acknowledging financial analysis's critical role, we aim to devise financial-specialized LLM-based toolchains and democratize access to them through open-source initiatives, promoting wider AI adoption in financial decision-making.
  In this paper, we introduce FinRobot, a novel open-source AI agent platform supporting multiple financially specialized AI agents, each powered by LLM. Specifically, the platform consists of four major layers: 1) the Financial AI Agents layer that formulates Financial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) by breaking sophisticated financial problems down into logical sequences; 2) the Financial LLM Algorithms layer dynamically configures appropriate model application strategies for specific tasks; 3) the LLMOps and DataOps layer produces accurate models by applying training/fine-tuning techniques and using task-relevant data; 4) the Multi-source LLM Foundation Models layer that integrates various LLMs and enables the above layers to access them directly. Finally, FinRobot provides hands-on for both professional-grade analysts and laypersons to utilize powerful AI techniques for advanced financial analysis. We open-source FinRobot at \url{https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot}.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Feature Preferences: Learning Reward-Relevant Preferences from Human Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans use social context to specify preferences over behaviors, i.e. their reward functions. Yet, algorithms for inferring reward models from preference data do not take this social learning view into account. Inspired by pragmatic human communication, we study how to extract fine-grained data regarding why an example is preferred that is useful for learning more accurate reward models. We propose to enrich binary preference queries to ask both (1) which features of a given example are preferable in addition to (2) comparisons between examples themselves. We derive an approach for learning from these feature-level preferences, both for cases where users specify which features are reward-relevant, and when users do not. We evaluate our approach on linear bandit settings in both vision- and language-based domains. Results support the efficiency of our approach in quickly converging to accurate rewards with fewer comparisons vs. example-only labels. Finally, we validate the real-world applicability with a behavioral experiment on a mushroom foraging task. Our findings suggest that incorporating pragmatic feature preferences is a promising approach for more efficient user-aligned reward learning.</description>

      <title>A Textbook Remedy for Domain Shifts: Knowledge Priors for Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep networks have achieved broad success in analyzing natural images, when applied to medical scans, they often fail in unexcepted situations. We investigate this challenge and focus on model sensitivity to domain shifts, such as data sampled from different hospitals or data confounded by demographic variables such as sex, race, etc, in the context of chest X-rays and skin lesion images. A key finding we show empirically is that existing visual backbones lack an appropriate prior from the architecture for reliable generalization in these settings. Taking inspiration from medical training, we propose giving deep networks a prior grounded in explicit medical knowledge communicated in natural language. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-enhanced Bottlenecks (KnoBo), a class of concept bottleneck models that incorporates knowledge priors that constrain it to reason with clinically relevant factors found in medical textbooks or PubMed. KnoBo uses retrieval-augmented language models to design an appropriate concept space paired with an automatic training procedure for recognizing the concept. We evaluate different resources of knowledge and recognition architectures on a broad range of domain shifts across 20 datasets. In our comprehensive evaluation with two imaging modalities, KnoBo outperforms fine-tuned models on confounded datasets by 32.4% on average. Finally, evaluations reveal that PubMed is a promising resource for making medical models less sensitive to domain shift, outperforming other resources on both diversity of information and final prediction performance.</description>

      <title>A Cascade Dual-Decoder Model for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.14163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In knowledge graph construction, a challenging issue is how to extract complex (e.g., overlapping) entities and relationships from a small amount of unstructured historical data. The traditional pipeline methods are to divide the extraction into two separate subtasks, which misses the potential interaction between the two subtasks and may lead to error propagation. In this work, we propose an effective cascade dual-decoder method to extract overlapping relational triples, which includes a text-specific relation decoder and a relation-corresponded entity decoder. Our approach is straightforward and it includes a text-specific relation decoder and a relation-corresponded entity decoder. The text-specific relation decoder detects relations from a sentence at the text level. That is, it does this according to the semantic information of the whole sentence. For each extracted relation, which is with trainable embedding, the relation-corresponded entity decoder detects the corresponding head and tail entities using a span-based tagging scheme. In this way, the overlapping triple problem can be tackled naturally. We conducted experiments on a real-world open-pit mine dataset and two public datasets to verify the method's generalizability. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed method and achieve better F1 scores under strict evaluation metrics. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/prastunlp/DualDec.</description>

Abstract: As for multilingual language models, it is important to select languages for training because of the curse of multilinguality. It is known that using languages with similar language structures is effective for cross lingual transfer learning. However, we demonstrate that using agglutinative languages such as Korean is more effective in cross lingual transfer learning. This is a great discovery that will change the training strategy of cross lingual transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Probing for the Usage of Grammatical Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central quest of probing is to uncover how pre-trained models encode a linguistic property within their representations. An encoding, however, might be spurious-i.e., the model might not rely on it when making predictions. In this paper, we try to find encodings that the model actually uses, introducing a usage-based probing setup. We first choose a behavioral task which cannot be solved without using the linguistic property. Then, we attempt to remove the property by intervening on the model's representations. We contend that, if an encoding is used by the model, its removal should harm the performance on the chosen behavioral task. As a case study, we focus on how BERT encodes grammatical number, and on how it uses this encoding to solve the number agreement task. Experimentally, we find that BERT relies on a linear encoding of grammatical number to produce the correct behavioral output. We also find that BERT uses a separate encoding of grammatical number for nouns and verbs. Finally, we identify in which layers information about grammatical number is transferred from a noun to its head verb.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present CSCD-NS, the first Chinese spelling check (CSC) dataset designed for native speakers, containing 40,000 samples from a Chinese social platform. Compared with existing CSC datasets aimed at Chinese learners, CSCD-NS is ten times larger in scale and exhibits a distinct error distribution, with a significantly higher proportion of word-level errors. To further enhance the data resource, we propose a novel method that simulates the input process through an input method, generating large-scale and high-quality pseudo data that closely resembles the actual error distribution and outperforms existing methods. Moreover, we investigate the performance of various models in this scenario, including large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. The result indicates that generative models underperform BERT-like classification models due to strict length and pronunciation constraints. The high prevalence of word-level errors also makes CSC for native speakers challenging enough, leaving substantial room for improvement.</description>

Abstract: While Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) has seen a tremendous advancement in the last few years, new applications and implementation scenarios present novel challenges and opportunities. These range from leveraging the conversational context, speaker and emotion dynamics modelling, to interpreting common sense expressions, informal language and sarcasm, addressing challenges of real time ERC, recognizing emotion causes, different taxonomies across datasets, multilingual ERC to interpretability. This survey starts by introducing ERC, elaborating on the challenges and opportunities pertaining to this task. It proceeds with a description of the emotion taxonomies and a variety of ERC benchmark datasets employing such taxonomies. This is followed by descriptions of the most prominent works in ERC with explanations of the Deep Learning architectures employed. Then, it provides advisable ERC practices towards better frameworks, elaborating on methods to deal with subjectivity in annotations and modelling and methods to deal with the typically unbalanced ERC datasets. Finally, it presents systematic review tables comparing several works regarding the methods used and their performance. The survey highlights the advantage of leveraging techniques to address unbalanced data, the exploration of mixed emotions and the benefits of incorporating annotation subjectivity in the learning phase.</description>

      <title>CroCoSum: A Benchmark Dataset for Cross-Lingual Code-Switched Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-lingual summarization (CLS) has attracted increasing interest in recent years due to the availability of large-scale web-mined datasets and the advancements of multilingual language models. However, given the rareness of naturally occurring CLS resources, the majority of datasets are forced to rely on translation which can contain overly literal artifacts. This restricts our ability to observe naturally occurring CLS pairs that capture organic diction, including instances of code-switching. This alteration between languages in mid-message is a common phenomenon in multilingual settings yet has been largely overlooked in cross-lingual contexts due to data scarcity. To address this gap, we introduce CroCoSum, a dataset of cross-lingual code-switched summarization of technology news. It consists of over 24,000 English source articles and 18,000 human-written Chinese news summaries, with more than 92% of the summaries containing code-switched phrases. For reference, we evaluate the performance of existing approaches including pipeline, end-to-end, and zero-shot methods. We show that leveraging existing CLS resources as a pretraining step does not improve performance on CroCoSum, indicating the limited generalizability of current datasets. Finally, we discuss the challenges of evaluating cross-lingual summarizers on code-switched generation through qualitative error analyses.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Query Generation for Privacy-Preserving Deep Retrieval Systems using Differentially Private Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees in training deep retrieval systems. Training these systems often involves the use of contrastive-style losses, which are typically non-per-example decomposable, making them difficult to directly DP-train with since common techniques require per-example gradients. To address this issue, we propose an approach that prioritizes ensuring query privacy prior to training a deep retrieval system. Our method employs DP language models (LMs) to generate private synthetic queries representative of the original data. These synthetic queries can be used in downstream retrieval system training without compromising privacy. Our approach demonstrates a significant enhancement in retrieval quality compared to direct DP-training, all while maintaining query-level privacy guarantees. This work highlights the potential of harnessing LMs to overcome limitations in standard DP-training methods.</description>

      <title>Advancing African-Accented Speech Recognition: Epistemic Uncertainty-Driven Data Selection for Generalizable ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02105v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accents play a pivotal role in shaping human communication, enhancing our ability to convey and comprehend messages with clarity and cultural nuance. While there has been significant progress in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), African-accented English ASR has been understudied due to a lack of training datasets, which are often expensive to create and demand colossal human labor. Combining several active learning paradigms and the core-set approach, we propose a new multi-rounds adaptation process that uses epistemic uncertainty to automate the annotation process, significantly reducing the associated costs and human labor. This novel method streamlines data annotation and strategically selects data samples that contribute most to model uncertainty, thereby enhancing training efficiency. We define a new metric called U-WER to track model adaptation to hard accents. We evaluate our approach across several domains, datasets, and high-performing speech models. Our results show that our approach leads to a 69.44\% WER improvement while requiring on average 45\% less data than established baselines. Our approach also improves out-of-distribution generalization for very low-resource accents, demonstrating its viability for building generalizable ASR models in the context of accented African ASR.

      <title>Pareto Optimal Learning for Estimating Large Language Model Errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16564v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in many applications. When a concrete and precise answer is desired, it is important to have a quantitative estimation of the potential error rate. However, this can be challenging due to the text-in-text-out nature of generative models. We present a method based on Pareto optimization that generates a risk score to estimate the probability of error in an LLM response by integrating multiple sources of information. We prove theoretically that the error estimator optimized in our framework aligns with the LLM and the information sources in an Pareto optimal manner. Experimental results show that the risk scores estimated by our method are well correlated with the true LLM error rate, thus facilitating error correction. By dynamically combining with prompting strategies such as self-verification and information retrieval, we demonstrate the proposed method can be utilized to increase the performance of an LLM, surpassing state-of-the-art task specific models.</description>

      <title>Controllable Data Augmentation for Few-Shot Text Mining with Chain-of-Thought Attribute Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has recently become a common practice in few-shot NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose Chain-of-Thought Attribute Manipulation (CoTAM), a novel approach that generates new data from existing examples by only tweaking in the user-provided, task-specific attribute, e.g., sentiment polarity or topic in movie reviews. Instead of conventional latent representation controlling, we leverage the chain-of-thought prompting to directly edit the text in three steps, (1) attribute decomposition, (2) manipulation proposal, and (3) sentence reconstruction. Extensive results on various tasks, such as text (pair) classification, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and conditional text generation, verify the superiority of CoTAM over other LLM-based augmentation methods with the same number of training examples for both fine-tuning and in-context learning. Remarkably, the 2D visualization of the augmented dataset using principal component analysis revealed a human-recognizable decision boundary that is likely hinted by the attribute manipulation, demonstrating the potential of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Dialogue Agents 101: A Beginner's Guide to Critical Ingredients for Designing Effective Conversational Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharing ideas through communication with peers is the primary mode of human interaction. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted in the area of conversational AI, leading to an increase in the availability and diversity of conversational tasks, datasets, and methods. However, with numerous tasks being explored simultaneously, the current landscape of conversational AI becomes fragmented. Therefore, initiating a well-thought-out model for a dialogue agent can pose significant challenges for a practitioner. Towards highlighting the critical ingredients needed for a practitioner to design a dialogue agent from scratch, the current study provides a comprehensive overview of the primary characteristics of a dialogue agent, the supporting tasks, their corresponding open-domain datasets, and the methods used to benchmark these datasets. We observe that different methods have been used to tackle distinct dialogue tasks. However, building separate models for each task is costly and does not leverage the correlation among the several tasks of a dialogue agent. As a result, recent trends suggest a shift towards building unified foundation models. To this end, we propose UNIT, a UNified dIalogue dataseT constructed from conversations of existing datasets for different dialogue tasks capturing the nuances for each of them. We also examine the evaluation strategies used to measure the performance of dialogue agents and highlight the scope for future research in the area of conversational AI.</description>

      <title>LaFiCMIL: Rethinking Large File Classification from the Perspective of Correlated Multiple Instance Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01413v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfomer-based models have significantly advanced natural language processing, in particular the performance in text classification tasks. Nevertheless, these models face challenges in processing large files, primarily due to their input constraints, which are generally restricted to hundreds or thousands of tokens. Attempts to address this issue in existing models usually consist in extracting only a fraction of the essential information from lengthy inputs, while often incurring high computational costs due to their complex architectures. In this work, we address the challenge of classifying large files from the perspective of correlated multiple instance learning. We introduce LaFiCMIL, a method specifically designed for large file classification. LaFiCMIL is optimized for efficient operation on a single GPU, making it a versatile solution for binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments using seven diverse and comprehensive benchmark datasets to assess LaFiCMIL's effectiveness. By integrating BERT for feature extraction, LaFiCMIL demonstrates exceptional performance, setting new benchmarks across all datasets. A notable achievement of our approach is its ability to scale BERT to handle nearly 20,000 tokens while operating on a single GPU with 32GB of memory. This efficiency, coupled with its state-of-the-art performance, highlights LaFiCMIL's potential as a groundbreaking approach in the field of large file classification.</description>

Abstract: Existing large language models have to run K times to generate a sequence of K tokens. In this paper, we present RecycleGPT, a generative language model with fast decoding speed by recycling pre-generated model states without running the whole model in multiple steps. Our approach relies on the observation that adjacent tokens in a sequence usually have strong correlations and the next token in a sequence can be reasonably guessed or inferred based on the preceding ones. Experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in lowering inference latency, achieving up to 1.4x speedup while preserving high performance.</description>

Abstract: Educational materials such as survey articles in specialized fields like computer science traditionally require tremendous expert inputs and are therefore expensive to create and update. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various general tasks. However, their effectiveness and limitations in the education domain are yet to be fully explored. In this work, we examine the proficiency of LLMs in generating succinct survey articles specific to the niche field of NLP in computer science, focusing on a curated list of 99 topics. Automated benchmarks reveal that GPT-4 surpasses its predecessors, inluding GPT-3.5, PaLM2, and LLaMa2 by margins ranging from 2% to 20% in comparison to the established ground truth. We compare both human and GPT-based evaluation scores and provide in-depth analysis. While our findings suggest that GPT-created surveys are more contemporary and accessible than human-authored ones, certain limitations were observed. Notably, GPT-4, despite often delivering outstanding content, occasionally exhibited lapses like missing details or factual errors. At last, we compared the rating behavior between humans and GPT-4 and found systematic bias in using GPT evaluation.</description>

      <title>Optimize Weight Rounding via Signed Gradient Descent for the Quantization of LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05516v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in language-related tasks, but their deployment poses significant challenges due to substantial memory and storage requirements. Weight-only quantization has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges. Previous research suggests that fine-tuning through up and down rounding can enhance performance. In this study, we introduce SignRound, a method that utilizes signed gradient descent (SignSGD) to optimize rounding values and weight clipping within just 200 steps. SignRound integrates the advantages of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), achieving exceptional results across 2 to 4 bits while maintaining low tuning costs and avoiding additional inference overhead. For example, SignRound achieves absolute average accuracy improvements ranging from 6.91\% to 33.22\% at 2 bits. It also demonstrates robust generalization to recent models and achieves near-lossless quantization in most scenarios at 4 bits. The source code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/intel/auto-round}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in few-shot question answering (QA) mostly rely on the power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuning in specific settings. Although the pre-training stage has already equipped LLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities, LLMs still need to be fine-tuned to adapt to specific domains to achieve the best results. In this paper, we propose to select the most informative data for fine-tuning, thereby improving the efficiency of the fine-tuning process with comparative or even better accuracy on the open-domain QA task. We present MinPrompt, a minimal data augmentation framework for open-domain QA based on an approximate graph algorithm and unsupervised question generation. We transform the raw text into a graph structure to build connections between different factual sentences, then apply graph algorithms to identify the minimal set of sentences needed to cover the most information in the raw text. We then generate QA pairs based on the identified sentence subset and train the model on the selected sentences to obtain the final model. Empirical results on several benchmark datasets and theoretical analysis show that MinPrompt is able to achieve comparable or better results than baselines with a high degree of efficiency, bringing consistent improvements in F-1 scores.</description>

      <title>Towards Verifiable Generation: A Benchmark for Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although achieving great success, Large Language Models (LLMs) usually suffer from unreliable hallucinations. Although language attribution can be a potential solution, there are no suitable benchmarks and evaluation metrics to attribute LLMs to structured knowledge. In this paper, we define a new task of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA) that improves upon three core concerns with conventional attributed LMs. First, we extend attribution source from unstructured texts to Knowledge Graph (KG), whose rich structures benefit both the attribution performance and working scenarios. Second, we propose a new ``Conscious Incompetence" setting considering the incomplete knowledge repository, where the model identifies the need for supporting knowledge beyond the provided KG. Third, we propose a comprehensive automatic evaluation metric encompassing text quality, citation quality, and text citation alignment. To implement the above innovations, we build a dataset in biography domain BioKaLMA via evolutionary question generation strategy, to control the question complexity and necessary knowledge to the answer. For evaluation, we develop a baseline solution and demonstrate the room for improvement in LLMs' citation generation, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the "Conscious Incompetence" setting, and the critical role of retrieval accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Humans often interact with large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn interaction to obtain desired answers or more information. However, most existing studies overlook the multi-turn instruction following ability of LLMs, in terms of training dataset, training method, and evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a solution aiming to enhance multi-turn instruction following for LLMs. First, we introduce an efficient but effective method for collecting multi-turn instructions that feature human-like queries, such as anaphora and ellipsis. Second, we propose a context-aware preference optimization strategy to further enhance LLMs for complex queries in multi-turn interaction. Moreover, to quantitatively evaluate LLMs in multi-turn instruction following, we manually build a multi-turn benchmark derived from existing ones. Extensive experiments show that Parrot improves current LLMs by up to 7.2% in multi-turn instruction following. Our dataset and codes will be open-sourced to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Phenomenal Yet Puzzling: Testing Inductive Reasoning Capabilities of Language Models with Hypothesis Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08559v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to derive underlying principles from a handful of observations and then generalize to novel situations -- known as inductive reasoning -- is central to human intelligence. Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) often fall short on inductive reasoning, despite achieving impressive success on research benchmarks. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs through iterative hypothesis refinement, a technique that more closely mirrors the human inductive process than standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis refinement employs a three-step process: proposing, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form of textual rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that LMs are phenomenal hypothesis proposers (i.e., generating candidate rules), and when coupled with a (task-specific) symbolic interpreter that is able to systematically filter the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achieves strong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that require inducing causal relations, language-like instructions, and symbolic concepts. However, they also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performance gaps between rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules) and rule application (i.e., applying proposed rules to instances), suggesting that LMs are proposing hypotheses without being able to actually apply the rules. Through empirical and human analyses, we further reveal several discrepancies between the inductive reasoning processes of LMs and humans, shedding light on both the potentials and limitations of using LMs in inductive reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Document-Level In-Context Few-Shot Relation Extraction via Pre-Trained Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Document-level relation extraction aims at inferring structured human knowledge from textual documents. State-of-the-art methods for this task use pre-trained language models (LMs) via fine-tuning, yet fine-tuning is computationally expensive and cannot adapt to new relation types or new LMs. As a remedy, we leverage the generalization capabilities of pre-trained LMs and present a novel framework for document-level in-context few-shot relation extraction. Our framework has three strengths: it eliminates the need (1) for named entity recognition and (2) for human annotations of documents, and (3) it can be updated to new LMs without re-training. We evaluate our framework using DocRED, the largest publicly available dataset for document-level relation extraction, and demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further show that our framework actually performs much better than the original labels from the development set of DocRED. Finally, we demonstrate that our complete framework yields consistent performance gains across diverse datasets and across different pre-trained LMs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to reformulate the document-level relation extraction task as a tailored in-context few-shot learning paradigm.</description>

Abstract: Word meanings change over time, and word senses evolve, emerge or die out in the process. For ancient languages, where the corpora are often small and sparse, modelling such changes accurately proves challenging, and quantifying uncertainty in sense-change estimates consequently becomes important. GASC (Genre-Aware Semantic Change) and DiSC (Diachronic Sense Change) are existing generative models that have been used to analyse sense change for target words from an ancient Greek text corpus, using unsupervised learning without the help of any pre-training. These models represent the senses of a given target word such as ``kosmos'' (meaning decoration, order or world) as distributions over context words, and sense prevalence as a distribution over senses. The models are fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to measure temporal changes in these representations. This paper introduces EDiSC, an Embedded DiSC model, which combines word embeddings with DiSC to provide superior model performance. It is shown empirically that EDiSC offers improved predictive accuracy, ground-truth recovery and uncertainty quantification, as well as better sampling efficiency and scalability properties with MCMC methods. The challenges of fitting these models are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Self-Rationalizers with Multi-Reward Distillation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LMs) are capable of generating free-text rationales to aid question answering. However, prior work 1) suggests that useful self-rationalization is emergent only at significant scales (e.g., 175B parameter GPT-3); and 2) focuses largely on downstream performance, ignoring the semantics of the rationales themselves, e.g., are they faithful, true, and helpful for humans? In this work, we enable small-scale LMs (approx. 200x smaller than GPT-3) to generate rationales that not only improve downstream task performance, but are also more plausible, consistent, and diverse, assessed both by automatic and human evaluation. Our method, MaRio (Multi-rewArd RatIOnalization), is a multi-reward conditioned self-rationalization algorithm that optimizes multiple distinct properties like plausibility, diversity and consistency. Results on five difficult question-answering datasets StrategyQA, QuaRel, OpenBookQA, NumerSense and QASC show that not only does MaRio improve task accuracy, but it also improves the self-rationalization quality of small LMs across the aforementioned axes better than a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline. Extensive human evaluations confirm that MaRio rationales are preferred vs. SFT rationales, as well as qualitative improvements in plausibility and consistency.</description>

Abstract: We present BYOKG, a universal question-answering (QA) system that can operate on any knowledge graph (KG), requires no human-annotated training data, and can be ready to use within a day -- attributes that are out-of-scope for current KGQA systems. BYOKG draws inspiration from the remarkable ability of humans to comprehend information present in an unseen KG through exploration -- starting at random nodes, inspecting the labels of adjacent nodes and edges, and combining them with their prior world knowledge. In BYOKG, exploration leverages an LLM-backed symbolic agent that generates a diverse set of query-program exemplars, which are then used to ground a retrieval-augmented reasoning procedure to predict programs for arbitrary questions. BYOKG is effective over both small- and large-scale graphs, showing dramatic gains in QA accuracy over a zero-shot baseline of 27.89 and 58.02 F1 on GrailQA and MetaQA, respectively. On GrailQA, we further show that our unsupervised BYOKG outperforms a supervised in-context learning method, demonstrating the effectiveness of exploration. Lastly, we find that performance of BYOKG reliably improves with continued exploration as well as improvements in the base LLM, notably outperforming a state-of-the-art fine-tuned model by 7.08 F1 on a sub-sampled zero-shot split of GrailQA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: News media often strive to minimize explicit moral language in news articles, yet most articles are dense with moral values as expressed through the reported events themselves. However, values that are reflected in the intricate dynamics among participating entities and moral events are far more challenging for most NLP systems to detect, including LLMs. To study this phenomenon, we annotate a new dataset, MORAL EVENTS, consisting of 5,494 structured event annotations on 474 news articles by diverse US media across the political spectrum. We further propose MOKA, a moral event extraction framework with MOral Knowledge Augmentation, which leverages knowledge derived from moral words and moral scenarios to produce structural representations of morality-bearing events. Experiments show that MOKA outperforms competitive baselines across three moral event understanding tasks. Further analysis shows even ostensibly nonpartisan media engage in the selective reporting of moral events. Our data and codebase are available at https://github.com/launchnlp/MOKA.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in important tasks such as natural language understanding and language generation, and thus have the potential to make a substantial impact on our society. Such capabilities, however, come with the considerable resources they demand, highlighting the strong need to develop effective techniques for addressing their efficiency challenges. In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of efficient LLMs research. We organize the literature in a taxonomy consisting of three main categories, covering distinct yet interconnected efficient LLMs topics from model-centric, data-centric, and framework-centric perspective, respectively. We have also created a GitHub repository where we organize the papers featured in this survey at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/Efficient-LLMs-Survey. We will actively maintain the repository and incorporate new research as it emerges. We hope our survey can serve as a valuable resource to help researchers and practitioners gain a systematic understanding of efficient LLMs research and inspire them to contribute to this important and exciting field.</description>

Abstract: The exponential growth of digital content has generated massive textual datasets, necessitating the use of advanced analytical approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as tools that are capable of processing and extracting insights from massive unstructured textual datasets. However, how to leverage LLMs for text analytics Information Systems (IS) research is currently unclear. To assist the IS community in understanding how to operationalize LLMs, we propose a Text Analytics for Information Systems Research (TAISR) framework. Our proposed framework provides detailed recommendations grounded in IS and LLM literature on how to conduct meaningful text analytics IS research for design science, behavioral, and econometric streams. We conducted three business intelligence case studies using our TAISR framework to demonstrate its application in several IS research contexts. We also outline the potential challenges and limitations of adopting LLMs for IS. By offering a systematic approach and evidence of its utility, our TAISR framework contributes to future IS research streams looking to incorporate powerful LLMs for text analytics.</description>

      <title>TransliCo: A Contrastive Learning Framework to Address the Script Barrier in Multilingual Pretrained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The world's more than 7000 languages are written in at least 293 scripts. Due to various reasons, many closely related languages use different scripts, which poses a difficulty for multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) in learning crosslingual knowledge through lexical overlap. As a consequence, mPLMs are faced with a script barrier: representations from different scripts are located in different subspaces, which can result in crosslingual transfer involving languages of different scripts performing suboptimally. To address this problem, we propose TransliCo, a framework that optimizes the Transliteration Contrastive Modeling (TCM) objective to fine-tune an mPLM by contrasting sentences in its training data and their transliterations in a unified script (in our case Latin), which enhances uniformity in the representation space for different scripts. Using Glot500-m, an mPLM pretrained on over 500 languages, as our source model, we fine-tune it on a small portion (5%) of its training data, and refer to the resulting model as Furina. We show that Furina not only better aligns representations from distinct scripts but also outperforms the original Glot500-m on various zero-shot crosslingual transfer tasks. Additionally, we achieve consistent improvement in a case study on the Indic group where the languages exhibit areal features but use different scripts. We make our code and models publicly available.</description>

      <title>Proximal Causal Inference With Text Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent text-based causal methods attempt to mitigate confounding bias by estimating proxies of confounding variables that are partially or imperfectly measured from unstructured text data. These approaches, however, assume analysts have supervised labels of the confounders given text for a subset of instances, a constraint that is sometimes infeasible due to data privacy or annotation costs. In this work, we address settings in which an important confounding variable is completely unobserved. We propose a new causal inference method that uses multiple instances of pre-treatment text data, infers two proxies from two zero-shot models on the separate instances, and applies these proxies in the proximal g-formula. We prove that our text-based proxy method satisfies identification conditions required by the proximal g-formula while other seemingly reasonable proposals do not. We evaluate our method in synthetic and semi-synthetic settings and find that it produces estimates with low bias. To address untestable assumptions associated with the proximal g-formula, we further propose an odds ratio falsification heuristic. This new combination of proximal causal inference and zero-shot classifiers expands the set of text-specific causal methods available to practitioners.</description>

      <title>Machine Translation Models are Zero-Shot Detectors of Translation Direction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting the translation direction of parallel text has applications for machine translation training and evaluation, but also has forensic applications such as resolving plagiarism or forgery allegations. In this work, we explore an unsupervised approach to translation direction detection based on the simple hypothesis that $p(\text{translation}|\text{original})&gt;p(\text{original}|\text{translation})$, motivated by the well-known simplification effect in translationese or machine-translationese. In experiments with massively multilingual machine translation models across 20 translation directions, we confirm the effectiveness of the approach for high-resource language pairs, achieving document-level accuracies of 82--96% for NMT-produced translations, and 60--81% for human translations, depending on the model used.

      <title>CANDLE: Iterative Conceptualization and Instantiation Distillation from Large Language Models for Commonsense Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sequential process of conceptualization and instantiation is essential to generalizable commonsense reasoning as it allows the application of existing knowledge to unfamiliar scenarios. However, existing works tend to undervalue the step of instantiation and heavily rely on pre-built concept taxonomies and human annotations to collect both types of knowledge, resulting in a lack of instantiated knowledge to complete reasoning, high cost, and limited scalability. To tackle these challenges, we introduce CANDLE, a distillation framework that iteratively performs contextualized conceptualization and instantiation over commonsense knowledge bases by instructing large language models to generate both types of knowledge with critic filtering. By applying CANDLE to ATOMIC, we construct a comprehensive knowledge base comprising six million conceptualizations and instantiated commonsense knowledge triples. Both types of knowledge are firmly rooted in the original ATOMIC dataset, and intrinsic evaluations demonstrate their exceptional quality and diversity. Empirical results indicate that distilling CANDLE on student models provides benefits across four downstream tasks. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/CANDLE.</description>

      <title>Model Editing at Scale leads to Gradual and Catastrophic Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Editing knowledge in large language models is an attractive capability to have which allows us to correct incorrectly learnt facts during pre-training, as well as update the model with an ever-growing list of new facts. While existing model editing techniques have shown promise, they are usually evaluated using metrics for reliability, specificity and generalization over one or few edits. We argue that for model editing to have practical utility, we must be able to make multiple edits to the same model. With this in mind, we evaluate the current model editing methods at scale, focusing on two state of the art methods: ROME and MEMIT. We find that as the model is edited sequentially with multiple facts, it continually forgets previously edited facts and the ability to perform downstream tasks. This forgetting happens in two phases -- an initial gradual but progressive forgetting phase followed by abrupt or catastrophic forgetting phase. Both gradual and catastrophic forgetting limit the usefulness of model editing methods at scale -- the former making model editing less effective as multiple edits are made to the model while the latter caps the scalability of such model editing methods. Our analysis also highlights other key limitations of ROME and MEMIT at scale. With our work, we push for the development and evaluation of model editing methods keeping scalability in mind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10225v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce ChatQA, a suite of models that outperform GPT-4 on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and conversational question answering (QA). To enhance generation, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning method that significantly boosts the performance of RAG. For effective retrieval, we introduce a dense retriever optimized for conversational QA, which yields results comparable to the alternative state-of-the-art query rewriting models, while substantially reducing deployment costs. We also present the ChatRAG Bench, which encompasses ten datasets covering comprehensive evaluations on RAG, table-related QA, arithmetic calculations, and scenarios involving unanswerable questions. Our ChatQA-1.0-70B (score: 54.14), built on Llama2, a weaker foundation model than GPT-4, can slightly outperform GPT-4-0613 (score: 53.90) and GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 (score: 54.03) on the ChatRAG Bench, without relying on any synthetic data from OpenAI GPT models. Notably, the Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B model surpasses the accuracy of GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, achieving a 4.4% improvement. To advance research in this field, we open-sourced the model weights, instruction tuning data, ChatRAG Bench, and retriever for the community: https://chatqa-project.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the critical data size in language models, a threshold that marks a fundamental shift from quick memorization to slow generalization. We formalize the phase transition under the grokking configuration into the Data Efficiency Hypothesis and identify data insufficiency, sufficiency, and surplus regimes in language models training dynamics. We develop a grokking configuration to reproduce grokking on simplistic language models stably by rescaling initialization and weight decay. We show that generalization occurs only when language models reach a critical size. We analyze grokking across sample-wise and model-wise, verifying the proposed data efficiency hypothesis. Our experiments reveal smoother phase transitions occurring at the critical dataset size for language datasets. As the model size increases, this critical point also becomes larger, indicating that larger models require more data. Our results deepen the understanding of language model training, offering a novel perspective on the role of data in the learning mechanism of language models.</description>

      <title>Fractal Patterns May Illuminate the Success of Next-Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fractal structure of language, aiming to provide a precise formalism for quantifying properties that may have been previously suspected but not formally shown. We establish that language is: (1) self-similar, exhibiting complexities at all levels of granularity, with no particular characteristic context length, and (2) long-range dependent (LRD), with a Hurst parameter of approximately H=0.7. Based on these findings, we argue that short-term patterns/dependencies in language, such as in paragraphs, mirror the patterns/dependencies over larger scopes, like entire documents. This may shed some light on how next-token prediction can capture the structure of text across multiple levels of granularity, from words and clauses to broader contexts and intents. In addition, we carry out an extensive analysis across different domains and architectures, showing that fractal parameters are robust. Finally, we demonstrate that the tiny variations in fractal parameters seen across LLMs improve upon perplexity-based bits-per-byte (BPB) in predicting their downstream performance. We hope these findings offer a fresh perspective on language and the mechanisms underlying the success of LLMs.</description>

      <title>LiPO: Listwise Preference Optimization through Learning-to-Rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning language models (LMs) with curated human feedback is critical to control their behaviors in real-world applications. Several recent policy optimization methods, such as DPO and SLiC, serve as promising alternatives to the traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) approach. In practice, human feedback often comes in a format of a ranked list over multiple responses to amortize the cost of reading prompt. Multiple responses can also be ranked by reward models or AI feedback. There lacks such a thorough study on directly fitting upon a list of responses. In this work, we formulate the LM alignment as a \textit{listwise} ranking problem and describe the LiPO framework, where the policy can potentially learn more effectively from a ranked list of plausible responses given the prompt. This view draws an explicit connection to Learning-to-Rank (LTR), where most existing preference optimization work can be mapped to existing ranking objectives. Following this connection, we provide an examination of ranking objectives that are not well studied for LM alignment with DPO and SLiC as special cases when list size is two. In particular, we highlight a specific method, LiPO-$\lambda$, which leverages a state-of-the-art \textit{listwise} ranking objective and weights each preference pair in a more advanced manner. We show that LiPO-$\lambda$ can outperform DPO variants and SLiC by a clear margin on several preference alignment tasks with both curated and real rankwise preference data.</description>

      <title>Panacea: Pareto Alignment via Preference Adaptation for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current methods for large language model alignment typically use scalar human preference labels. However, this convention tends to oversimplify the multi-dimensional and heterogeneous nature of human preferences, leading to reduced expressivity and even misalignment. This paper presents Panacea, an innovative approach that reframes alignment as a multi-dimensional preference optimization problem. Panacea trains a single model capable of adapting online and Pareto-optimally to diverse sets of preferences without the need for further tuning. A major challenge here is using a low-dimensional preference vector to guide the model's behavior, despite it being governed by an overwhelmingly large number of parameters. To address this, Panacea is designed to use singular value decomposition (SVD)-based low-rank adaptation, which allows the preference vector to be simply injected online as singular values. Theoretically, we prove that Panacea recovers the entire Pareto front with common loss aggregation methods under mild conditions. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of aligning a single LLM to represent an exponentially vast spectrum of human preferences through various optimization methods. Our work marks a step forward in effectively and efficiently aligning models to diverse and intricate human preferences in a controllable and Pareto-optimal manner.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Limits: A Survey of Techniques to Extend the Context Length in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities including understanding context, engaging in logical reasoning, and generating responses. However, this is achieved at the expense of stringent computational and memory requirements, hindering their ability to effectively support long input sequences. This survey provides an inclusive review of the recent techniques and methods devised to extend the sequence length in LLMs, thereby enhancing their capacity for long-context understanding. In particular, we review and categorize a wide range of techniques including architectural modifications, such as modified positional encoding and altered attention mechanisms, which are designed to enhance the processing of longer sequences while avoiding a proportional increase in computational requirements. The diverse methodologies investigated in this study can be leveraged across different phases of LLMs, i.e., training, fine-tuning and inference. This enables LLMs to efficiently process extended sequences. The limitations of the current methodologies is discussed in the last section along with the suggestions for future research directions, underscoring the importance of sequence length in the continued advancement of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Synergy-of-Thoughts: Eliciting Efficient Reasoning in Hybrid Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive emergent abilities in a wide range of tasks, but still face challenges in handling complex reasoning problems. Previous works like chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thoughts (ToT) have predominately focused on enhancing accuracy, but overlook the rapidly increasing token cost, which could be particularly problematic for open-ended real-world tasks with huge solution spaces. Motivated by the dual process theory of human cognition, we propose "Synergy of Thoughts" (SoT) to unleash the synergistic potential of hybrid LLMs for efficient reasoning. By default, SoT uses smaller-scale language models to generate multiple low-cost reasoning thoughts, which resembles the parallel intuitions produced by System 1. If these intuitions exhibit conflicts, SoT will invoke the reflective reasoning of scaled-up language models to emulate the intervention of System 2, which will override the intuitive thoughts and rectify the reasoning process. This framework is model-agnostic and training-free, which can be flexibly implemented with various off-the-shelf LLMs. Experiments on six representative reasoning tasks show that SoT substantially reduces the token cost by 38.3%-75.1%, and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy and solution diversity. Notably, the average token cost reduction on open-ended tasks reaches up to 69.1%. Code repo with all prompts will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>SemRel2024: A Collection of Semantic Textual Relatedness Datasets for 13 Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring and quantifying semantic relatedness is central to representing language and holds significant implications across various NLP tasks. While earlier NLP research primarily focused on semantic similarity, often within the English language context, we instead investigate the broader phenomenon of semantic relatedness. In this paper, we present \textit{SemRel}, a new semantic relatedness dataset collection annotated by native speakers across 13 languages: \textit{Afrikaans, Algerian Arabic, Amharic, English, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Kinyarwanda, Marathi, Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, Spanish,} and \textit{Telugu}. These languages originate from five distinct language families and are predominantly spoken in Africa and Asia -- regions characterised by a relatively limited availability of NLP resources. Each instance in the SemRel datasets is a sentence pair associated with a score that represents the degree of semantic textual relatedness between the two sentences. The scores are obtained using a comparative annotation framework. We describe the data collection and annotation processes, challenges when building the datasets, baseline experiments, and their impact and utility in NLP.</description>

      <title>AFaCTA: Assisting the Annotation of Factual Claim Detection with Reliable LLM Annotators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of generative AI, automated fact-checking methods to combat misinformation are becoming more and more important. However, factual claim detection, the first step in a fact-checking pipeline, suffers from two key issues that limit its scalability and generalizability: (1) inconsistency in definitions of the task and what a claim is, and (2) the high cost of manual annotation. To address (1), we review the definitions in related work and propose a unifying definition of factual claims that focuses on verifiability. To address (2), we introduce AFaCTA (Automatic Factual Claim deTection Annotator), a novel framework that assists in the annotation of factual claims with the help of large language models (LLMs). AFaCTA calibrates its annotation confidence with consistency along three predefined reasoning paths. Extensive evaluation and experiments in the domain of political speech reveal that AFaCTA can efficiently assist experts in annotating factual claims and training high-quality classifiers, and can work with or without expert supervision. Our analyses also result in PoliClaim, a comprehensive claim detection dataset spanning diverse political topics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model quantification uses low bit-width values to represent the weight matrices of existing models to be quantized, which is a promising approach to reduce both storage and computational overheads of deploying highly anticipated LLMs. However, current quantization methods suffer severe performance degradation when the bit-width is extremely reduced, and thus focus on utilizing 4-bit or 8-bit values to quantize models. This paper boldly quantizes the weight matrices of LLMs to 1-bit, paving the way for the extremely low bit-width deployment of LLMs. For this target, we introduce a 1-bit model compressing framework named OneBit, including a novel 1-bit parameter representation method to better quantize LLMs as well as an effective parameter initialization method based on matrix decomposition to improve the convergence speed of the quantization framework. Sufficient experimental results indicate that OneBit achieves good performance (at least 81% of the non-quantized performance on LLaMA models) with robust training processes when only using 1-bit weight matrices.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Reason with Rules? Logic Scaffolding for Stress-Testing and Improving LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive human-like performance across various reasoning tasks. However, their mastery of underlying inferential rules still falls short of human capabilities. To investigate this, we propose a logic scaffolding inferential rule generation framework, to construct an inferential rule base, ULogic, comprising both primitive and compositional rules across five domains. Our analysis of GPT-series models over a rule subset reveals significant gaps in LLMs' logic understanding compared to human performance, especially in compositional and structural complex rules with certain bias patterns. We further distill these rules into a smaller-scale inference engine for flexible rule generation and enhancing downstream reasoning. Through a multi-judger evaluation, our inference engine proves effective in generating accurate, complex and abstract conclusions and premises, and improve various commonsense reasoning tasks. Overall, our work sheds light on LLMs' limitations in grasping inferential rule and suggests ways to enhance their logical reasoning abilities~\footnote{Code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/SiyuanWangw/ULogic}.}.</description>

Abstract: Planning is a fundamental task in artificial intelligence that involves finding a sequence of actions that achieve a specified goal in a given environment. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for applications that require planning capabilities, such as web or embodied agents. In line with recent studies, we demonstrate through experimentation that LLMs lack necessary skills required for planning. Based on these observations, we advocate for the potential of a hybrid approach that combines LLMs with classical planning methodology. Then, we introduce SimPlan, a novel hybrid-method, and evaluate its performance in a new challenging setup. Our extensive experiments across various planning domains demonstrate that SimPlan significantly outperforms existing LLM-based planners.</description>

      <title>Where is the answer? Investigating Positional Bias in Language Model Knowledge Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models require updates to remain up-to-date or adapt to new domains by fine-tuning them with new documents. One key is memorizing the latest information in a way that the memorized information is extractable with a query prompt. However, LLMs suffer from a phenomenon called perplexity curse; despite minimizing document perplexity during fine-tuning, LLMs struggle to extract information through a prompt sentence. In this new knowledge acquisition and extraction, we find a very intriguing fact that LLMs can accurately answer questions about the first sentence, but they struggle to extract information described in the middle or end of the documents used for fine-tuning. Our study suggests that the auto-regressive training causes this issue; each token is prompted by reliance on all previous tokens, which hinders the model from recalling information from training documents by question prompts. To conduct the in-depth study, we publish both synthetic and real datasets, enabling the evaluation of the QA performance w.r.t. the position of the corresponding answer in a document. Our investigation shows that even a large model suffers from the perplexity curse, but regularization such as denoising auto-regressive loss can enhance the information extraction from diverse positions. These findings will be (i) a key to improving knowledge extraction from LLMs and (ii) new elements to discuss the trade-off between RAG and fine-tuning in adapting LLMs to a new domain.</description>

      <title>A Unified Taxonomy-Guided Instruction Tuning Framework for Entity Set Expansion and Taxonomy Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity set expansion, taxonomy expansion, and seed-guided taxonomy construction are three representative tasks that aim to automatically populate an existing taxonomy with new concepts. Previous studies view them as three separate tasks, and the proposed methods usually only work for one specific task, which lack generalizability and a holistic perspective across different tasks. In this paper, we aim to discover a unified solution to all three tasks. To be specific, we identify two common skills needed for entity set expansion, taxonomy expansion, and seed-guided taxonomy construction: finding "siblings" and finding "parents". We introduce a taxonomy-guided instruction tuning framework to teach a large language model to generate siblings and parents for query entities, where the joint pre-training process facilitates the mutual enhancement of these two skills. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed TaxoInstruct framework, which outperforms task-specific baselines across all three tasks.</description>

      <title>KorNAT: LLM Alignment Benchmark for Korean Social Values and Common Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13605v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be effectively deployed in a specific country, they must possess an understanding of the nation's culture and basic knowledge. To this end, we introduce National Alignment, which measures an alignment between an LLM and a targeted country from two aspects: social value alignment and common knowledge alignment. Social value alignment evaluates how well the model understands nation-specific social values, while common knowledge alignment examines how well the model captures basic knowledge related to the nation. We constructed KorNAT, the first benchmark that measures national alignment with South Korea. For the social value dataset, we obtained ground truth labels from a large-scale survey involving 6,174 unique Korean participants. For the common knowledge dataset, we constructed samples based on Korean textbooks and GED reference materials. KorNAT contains 4K and 6K multiple-choice questions for social value and common knowledge, respectively. Our dataset creation process is meticulously designed and based on statistical sampling theory and was refined through multiple rounds of human review. The experiment results of seven LLMs reveal that only a few models met our reference score, indicating a potential for further enhancement. KorNAT has received government approval after passing an assessment conducted by a government-affiliated organization dedicated to evaluating dataset quality. Samples and detailed evaluation protocols of our dataset can be found in https://huggingface.co/datasets/jiyounglee0523/KorNAT .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new challenge to test the STEM skills of neural models. The problems in the real world often require solutions, combining knowledge from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Unlike existing datasets, our dataset requires the understanding of multimodal vision-language information of STEM. Our dataset features one of the largest and most comprehensive datasets for the challenge. It includes 448 skills and 1,073,146 questions spanning all STEM subjects. Compared to existing datasets that often focus on examining expert-level ability, our dataset includes fundamental skills and questions designed based on the K-12 curriculum. We also add state-of-the-art foundation models such as CLIP and GPT-3.5-Turbo to our benchmark. Results show that the recent model advances only help master a very limited number of lower grade-level skills (2.5% in the third grade) in our dataset. In fact, these models are still well below (averaging 54.7%) the performance of elementary students, not to mention near expert-level performance. To understand and increase the performance on our dataset, we teach the models on a training split of our dataset. Even though we observe improved performance, the model performance remains relatively low compared to average elementary students. To solve STEM problems, we will need novel algorithmic innovations from the community.</description>

      <title>Causal Prompting: Debiasing Large Language Model Prompting based on Front-Door Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the notable advancements of existing prompting methods, such as In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought for Large Language Models (LLMs), they still face challenges related to various biases. Traditional debiasing methods primarily focus on the model training stage, including approaches based on data augmentation and reweighting, yet they struggle with the complex biases inherent in LLMs. To address such limitations, the causal relationship behind the prompting methods is uncovered using a structural causal model, and a novel causal prompting method based on front-door adjustment is proposed to effectively mitigate LLMs biases. In specific, causal intervention is achieved by designing the prompts without accessing the parameters and logits of LLMs. The chain-of-thought generated by LLM is employed as the mediator variable and the causal effect between input prompts and output answers is calculated through front-door adjustment to mitigate model biases. Moreover, to accurately represent the chain-of-thoughts and estimate the causal effects, contrastive learning is used to fine-tune the encoder of chain-of-thought by aligning its space with that of the LLM. Experimental results show that the proposed causal prompting approach achieves excellent performance across seven natural language processing datasets on both open-source and closed-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Detecting AI-Generated Sentences in Human-AI Collaborative Hybrid Texts: Challenges, Strategies, and Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03506v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the challenge of sentence-level AI-generated text detection within human-AI collaborative hybrid texts. Existing studies of AI-generated text detection for hybrid texts often rely on synthetic datasets. These typically involve hybrid texts with a limited number of boundaries. We contend that studies of detecting AI-generated content within hybrid texts should cover different types of hybrid texts generated in realistic settings to better inform real-world applications. Therefore, our study utilizes the CoAuthor dataset, which includes diverse, realistic hybrid texts generated through the collaboration between human writers and an intelligent writing system in multi-turn interactions. We adopt a two-step, segmentation-based pipeline: (i) detect segments within a given hybrid text where each segment contains sentences of consistent authorship, and (ii) classify the authorship of each identified segment. Our empirical findings highlight (1) detecting AI-generated sentences in hybrid texts is overall a challenging task because (1.1) human writers' selecting and even editing AI-generated sentences based on personal preferences adds difficulty in identifying the authorship of segments; (1.2) the frequent change of authorship between neighboring sentences within the hybrid text creates difficulties for segment detectors in identifying authorship-consistent segments; (1.3) the short length of text segments within hybrid texts provides limited stylistic cues for reliable authorship determination; (2) before embarking on the detection process, it is beneficial to assess the average length of segments within the hybrid text. This assessment aids in deciding whether (2.1) to employ a text segmentation-based strategy for hybrid texts with longer segments, or (2.2) to adopt a direct sentence-by-sentence classification strategy for those with shorter segments.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Contrastive Reasoners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompting methods play a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). We explore how contrastive prompting (CP) significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs are decent contrastive reasoners by simply adding "Let's give a correct and a wrong answer." before LLMs provide answers. Experiments on various large language models show that zero-shot contrastive prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks without any hand-crafted few-shot examples, such as increasing the accuracy on GSM8K from 35.9% to 88.8% and AQUA-RAT from 41.3% to 62.2% with the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model. Our method not only surpasses zero-shot CoT and few-shot CoT in most arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks but also can seamlessly integrate with existing prompting methods, resulting in improved or comparable results when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

      <description>arXiv:2403.13112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based NLP models are powerful but have high computational costs that limit deployment. Finetuned encoder-decoder models are popular in specialized domains and can outperform larger more generalized decoder-only models, such as GPT-4. We introduce a new configuration for encoder-decoder models that improves efficiency on structured output and decomposable tasks where multiple outputs are required for a single shared input. Our method, prompt-in-decoder (PiD), encodes the input once and decodes the output in parallel, boosting both training and inference efficiency by avoiding duplicate input encoding and increasing the operational intensity (ratio of numbers of arithmetic operation to memory access) of decoding process by sharing the input key-value cache. We achieve computation reduction that roughly scales with the number of subtasks, gaining up to 4.6x speed-up over state-of-the-art models for dialogue state tracking, summarization, and question-answering tasks, with comparable or better performance.</description>

      <title>Can multiple-choice questions really be useful in detecting the abilities of LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are widely used in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) due to their simplicity and efficiency. However, there are concerns about whether MCQs can truly measure LLM's capabilities, particularly in knowledge-intensive scenarios where long-form generation (LFG) answers are required. The misalignment between the task and the evaluation method demands a thoughtful analysis of MCQ's efficacy, which we undertake in this paper by evaluating nine LLMs on four question-answering (QA) datasets in two languages: Chinese and English. We identify a significant issue: LLMs exhibit an order sensitivity in bilingual MCQs, favoring answers located at specific positions, i.e., the first position. We further quantify the gap between MCQs and long-form generation questions (LFGQs) by comparing their direct outputs, token logits, and embeddings. Our results reveal a relatively low correlation between answers from MCQs and LFGQs for identical questions. Additionally, we propose two methods to quantify the consistency and confidence of LLMs' output, which can be generalized to other QA evaluation benchmarks. Notably, our analysis challenges the idea that the higher the consistency, the greater the accuracy. We also find MCQs to be less reliable than LFGQs in terms of expected calibration error. Finally, the misalignment between MCQs and LFGQs is not only reflected in the evaluation performance but also in the embedding space.

      <title>Streamlining Redundant Layers to Compress Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-Streamline, a novel layer pruning approach for large language models. It is based on the observation that different layers have varying impacts on hidden states, enabling the identification of less important layers. LLMStreamline comprises two parts: layer pruning, which removes consecutive layers with the lowest importance based on target sparsity, and layer replacement, where a lightweight network is trained to replace the pruned layers to mitigate performance loss. Additionally, a new metric called "stability" is proposed to address the limitations of accuracy in evaluating model compression. Experiments show that LLM-Streamline surpasses previous state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>MineLand: Simulating Large-Scale Multi-Agent Interactions with Limited Multimodal Senses and Physical Needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) hold promise for tasks requiring extensive collaboration, traditional multi-agent simulators have facilitated rich explorations of an interactive artificial society that reflects collective behavior. However, these existing simulators face significant limitations. Firstly, they struggle with handling large numbers of agents due to high resource demands. Secondly, they often assume agents possess perfect information and limitless capabilities, hindering the ecological validity of simulated social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-agent Minecraft simulator, MineLand, that bridges this gap by introducing three key features: large-scale scalability, limited multimodal senses, and physical needs. Our simulator supports 64 or more agents. Agents have limited visual, auditory, and environmental awareness, forcing them to actively communicate and collaborate to fulfill physical needs like food and resources. Additionally, we further introduce an AI agent framework, Alex, inspired by multitasking theory, enabling agents to handle intricate coordination and scheduling. Our experiments demonstrate that the simulator, the corresponding benchmark, and the AI agent framework contribute to more ecological and nuanced collective behavior.The source code of MineLand and Alex is openly available at https://github.com/cocacola-lab/MineLand.</description>

      <title>Measuring Social Norms of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02491v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new challenge to examine whether large language models understand social norms. In contrast to existing datasets, our dataset requires a fundamental understanding of social norms to solve. Our dataset features the largest set of social norm skills, consisting of 402 skills and 12,383 questions covering a wide set of social norms ranging from opinions and arguments to culture and laws. We design our dataset according to the K-12 curriculum. This enables the direct comparison of the social understanding of large language models to humans, more specifically, elementary students. While prior work generates nearly random accuracy on our benchmark, recent large language models such as GPT3.5-Turbo and LLaMA2-Chat are able to improve the performance significantly, only slightly below human performance. We then propose a multi-agent framework based on large language models to improve the models' ability to understand social norms. This method further improves large language models to be on par with humans. Given the increasing adoption of large language models in real-world applications, our finding is particularly important and presents a unique direction for future improvements.</description>

      <title>ReFT: Representation Finetuning for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods seek to adapt large neural models via updates to a small number of weights. However, much prior interpretability work has shown that representations encode rich semantic information, suggesting that editing representations might be a more powerful alternative. We pursue this hypothesis by developing a family of Representation Finetuning (ReFT) methods. ReFT methods operate on a frozen base model and learn task-specific interventions on hidden representations. We define a strong instance of the ReFT family, Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT), and we identify an ablation of this method that trades some performance for increased efficiency. Both are drop-in replacements for existing PEFTs and learn interventions that are 15x--65x more parameter-efficient than LoRA. We showcase LoReFT on eight commonsense reasoning tasks, four arithmetic reasoning tasks, instruction-tuning, and GLUE. In all these evaluations, our ReFTs deliver the best balance of efficiency and performance, and almost always outperform state-of-the-art PEFTs. We release a generic ReFT training library publicly at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in large language models have notably enhanced the efficiency of information extraction from unstructured and semi-structured data sources. As these technologies become integral to various applications, establishing an objective measure for the quality of information extraction becomes imperative. However, the scarcity of labeled data presents significant challenges to this endeavor. In this paper, we introduce an automatic framework to assess the quality of the information extraction/retrieval and its completeness. The framework focuses on information extraction in the form of entity and its properties. We discuss how to handle the input/output size limitations of the large language models and analyze their performance when extracting the information. In particular, we introduce scores to evaluate the quality of the extraction and provide an extensive discussion on how to interpret them.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method adapting phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore whether and how they relate to each other and to predict their performance characteristics. Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metrics based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.</description>

      <title>Rho-1: Not All Tokens Are What You Need</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous language model pre-training methods have uniformly applied a next-token prediction loss to all training tokens. Challenging this norm, we posit that ''Not all tokens in a corpus are equally important for language model training''. Our initial analysis examines token-level training dynamics of language model, revealing distinct loss patterns for different tokens. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a new language model called Rho-1. Unlike traditional LMs that learn to predict every next token in a corpus, Rho-1 employs Selective Language Modeling (SLM), which selectively trains on useful tokens that aligned with the desired distribution. This approach involves scoring pretraining tokens using a reference model, and then training the language model with a focused loss on tokens with higher scores. When continual pretraining on 15B OpenWebMath corpus, Rho-1 yields an absolute improvement in few-shot accuracy of up to 30% in 9 math tasks. After fine-tuning, Rho-1-1B and 7B achieved state-of-the-art results of 40.6% and 51.8% on MATH dataset, respectively - matching DeepSeekMath with only 3% of the pretraining tokens. Furthermore, when pretraining on 80B general tokens, Rho-1 achieves 6.8% average enhancement across 15 diverse tasks, increasing both efficiency and performance of the language model pre-training.</description>

      <title>Self-playing Adversarial Language Game Enhances LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the self-play training procedure of large language models (LLMs) in a two-player adversarial language game called Adversarial Taboo. In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate around a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to speak the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players should have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by self-play in this adversarial language game (SPAG). With this goal, we select several open-source LLMs and let each act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performances uniformly improve on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLMs' reasoning abilities. The code is at https://github.com/Linear95/SPAG.</description>

      <title>NormAd: A Benchmark for Measuring the Cultural Adaptability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various global cultures fundamentally presents a cultural challenge: LLMs must navigate interactions, respect social norms, and avoid transgressing cultural boundaries. However, it is still unclear if LLMs can adapt their outputs to diverse cultural norms. Our study focuses on this aspect. We introduce NormAd, a novel dataset, which includes 2.6k stories that represent social and cultural norms from 75 countries, to assess the ability of LLMs to adapt to different granular levels of socio-cultural contexts such as the country of origin, its associated cultural values, and prevalent social norms. Our study reveals that LLMs struggle with cultural reasoning across all contextual granularities, showing stronger adaptability to English-centric cultures over those from the Global South. Even with explicit social norms, the top-performing model, Mistral-7b-Instruct, achieves only 81.8\% accuracy, lagging behind the 95.6\% achieved by humans. Evaluation on NormAd further reveals that LLMs struggle to adapt to stories involving gift-giving across cultures. Due to inherent agreement or sycophancy biases, LLMs find it considerably easier to assess the social acceptability of stories that adhere to cultural norms than those that deviate from them. Our benchmark measures the cultural adaptability (or lack thereof) of LLMs, emphasizing the potential to make these technologies more equitable and useful for global audiences. We release the NormAd dataset and its associated code on GitHub.</description>

      <title>SpaceByte: Towards Deleting Tokenization from Large Language Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tokenization is widely used in large language models because it significantly improves performance. However, tokenization imposes several disadvantages, such as performance biases, increased adversarial vulnerability, decreased character-level modeling performance, and increased modeling complexity. To address these disadvantages without sacrificing performance, we propose SpaceByte, a novel byte-level decoder architecture that closes the performance gap between byte-level and subword autoregressive language modeling. SpaceByte consists of a byte-level Transformer model, but with extra larger transformer blocks inserted in the middle of the layers. We find that performance is significantly improved by applying these larger blocks only after certain bytes, such as space characters, which typically denote word boundaries. Our experiments show that for a fixed training and inference compute budget, SpaceByte outperforms other byte-level architectures and roughly matches the performance of tokenized Transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>MixLoRA: Enhancing Large Language Models Fine-Tuning with LoRA-based Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is a common practice to adapt pre-trained models for specific applications. While methods like LoRA have effectively addressed GPU memory constraints during fine-tuning, their performance often falls short, especially in multi-task scenarios. In contrast, Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models, such as Mixtral 8x7B, demonstrate remarkable performance in multi-task learning scenarios while maintaining a reduced parameter count. However, the resource requirements of these MoEs remain challenging, particularly for consumer-grade GPUs with less than 24GB memory. To tackle these challenges, we propose MixLoRA, an approach to construct a resource-efficient sparse MoE model based on LoRA. MixLoRA inserts multiple LoRA-based experts within the feed-forward network block of a frozen pre-trained dense model and employs a commonly used top-k router. Unlike other LoRA-based MoE methods, MixLoRA enhances model performance by utilizing independent attention-layer LoRA adapters. Additionally, an auxiliary load balance loss is employed to address the imbalance problem of the router. Our evaluations show that MixLoRA improves about 9% accuracy compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods in multi-task learning scenarios. We also propose a new high-throughput framework to alleviate the computation and memory bottlenecks during the training and inference of MOE models. This framework reduces GPU memory consumption by 40% and token computation latency by 30% during both training and inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Holmes, a benchmark to assess the linguistic competence of language models (LMs) - their ability to grasp linguistic phenomena. Unlike prior prompting-based evaluations, Holmes assesses the linguistic competence of LMs via their internal representations using classifier-based probing. In doing so, we disentangle specific phenomena (e.g., part-of-speech of words) from other cognitive abilities, like following textual instructions, and meet recent calls to assess LMs' linguistic competence in isolation. Composing Holmes, we review over 250 probing studies and feature more than 200 datasets to assess syntax, morphology, semantics, reasoning, and discourse phenomena. Analyzing over 50 LMs reveals that, aligned with known trends, their linguistic competence correlates with model size. However, surprisingly, model architecture and instruction tuning also significantly influence performance, particularly in morphology and syntax. Finally, we propose FlashHolmes, a streamlined version of Holmes designed to lower the high computation load while maintaining high-ranking precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning could in principle enable a deeper understanding of a language model's (LM) internal reasoning. However, prior work suggests that LMs can answer questions similarly despite changes in their CoT, suggesting that those models are not truly using the CoT. We propose an reinforcement learning technique to produce CoTs that are sufficient alone for predicting future text, independent of other context. This methodology ensures that if the LM can predict future tokens, then it must have used the CoT to understand its context. We formalize the informativeness of a sender to a receiver LM as the degree to which the sender helps the receiver predict their future observations, and we define a "Markovian" LM as one which predicts future text given only a CoT as context. We derive a "Markovian training" procedure by applying our definition of informativeness to a Markovian LM and optimizing via policy gradient and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We demonstrate our training algorithm's effectiveness on fifteen-term arithmetic problems, show the model utilizes the CoT, and externally validate that the generated CoT is meaningful and usable by another model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to new tasks through fine-tuning has been made more efficient by the introduction of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as LoRA. However, these methods often underperform compared to full fine-tuning, particularly in scenarios involving complex datasets. This issue becomes even more pronounced in complex domains, highlighting the need for improved PEFT approaches that can achieve better performance. Through a series of experiments, we have uncovered two critical insights that shed light on the training and parameter inefficiency of LoRA. Building on these insights, we have developed HydraLoRA, a LoRA framework with an asymmetric structure that eliminates the need for domain expertise. Our experiments demonstrate that HydraLoRA outperforms other PEFT approaches, even those that rely on domain knowledge during the training and inference phases.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Prompt-Learning for Structured Information Extraction from Crohn's Disease Radiology Reports in a Low-Resource Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic conversion of free-text radiology reports into structured data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques is crucial for analyzing diseases on a large scale. While effective for tasks in widely spoken languages like English, generative large language models (LLMs) typically underperform with less common languages and can pose potential risks to patient privacy. Fine-tuning local NLP models is hindered by the skewed nature of real-world medical datasets, where rare findings represent a significant data imbalance. We introduce SMP-BERT, a novel prompt learning method that leverages the structured nature of reports to overcome these challenges. In our studies involving a substantial collection of Crohn's disease radiology reports in Hebrew (over 8,000 patients and 10,000 reports), SMP-BERT greatly surpassed traditional fine-tuning methods in performance, notably in detecting infrequent conditions (AUC: 0.99 vs 0.94, F1: 0.84 vs 0.34). SMP-BERT empowers more accurate AI diagnostics available for low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Anchored Answers: Unravelling Positional Bias in GPT-2's Multiple-Choice Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT-4 and LLaMA families, have demonstrated considerable success across diverse tasks, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, these models exhibit a positional bias, particularly an even worse anchored bias in the GPT-2 family, where they consistently favour the first choice 'A' in MCQs during inference. This anchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2's decision-making process, as it skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the choices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability approach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for this bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention heads, using the "logit lens" method to trace and modify the specific value vectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and recalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first choice 'A', we effectively mitigate the anchored bias. Our interventions not only mitigate the bias but also improve the overall MCQ prediction accuracy for the GPT-2 family across various datasets. This work represents the first comprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias in MCQs within the GPT-2 models, introducing targeted, minimal-intervention strategies that significantly enhance GPT2 model robustness and accuracy in MCQs.

      <description>arXiv:2405.03548v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction tuning improves the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with data quality and scalability being the crucial factors. Most instruction tuning data come from human crowd-sourcing or GPT-4 distillation. We propose a paradigm to efficiently harvest 10 million naturally existing instruction data from the pre-training web corpus to enhance LLM reasoning. Our approach involves (1) recalling relevant documents, (2) extracting instruction-response pairs, and (3) refining the extracted pairs using open-source LLMs. Fine-tuning base LLMs on this dataset, we build MAmmoTH2 models, which significantly boost performance on reasoning benchmarks. Notably, MAmmoTH2-7B's (Mistral) performance increases from 11% to 36.7% on MATH and from 36% to 68.4% on GSM8K without training on any in-domain data. Further training MAmmoTH2 on public instruction tuning datasets yields MAmmoTH2-Plus, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several reasoning and chatbot benchmarks. Our work demonstrates how to harvest large-scale, high-quality instruction data without costly human annotation or GPT-4 distillation, providing a new paradigm for building better instruction tuning data.</description>

      <title>AlphaMath Almost Zero: process Supervision without process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially enhanced their mathematical reasoning abilities. However, these models still struggle with complex problems that require multiple reasoning steps, frequently leading to logical or numerical errors. While numerical mistakes can be largely addressed by integrating a code interpreter, identifying logical errors within intermediate steps is more challenging. Moreover, manually annotating these steps for training is not only expensive but also labor-intensive, requiring the expertise of professional annotators. In our study, we introduce an innovative approach that bypasses the need for process annotations (from human or GPTs) by utilizing the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework. This technique automatically generates both the process supervision and the step-level evaluation signals. Our method iteratively trains the policy and value models, leveraging the capabilities of a well-pretrained LLM to progressively enhance its mathematical reasoning skills. Furthermore, we propose an efficient inference strategy-step-level beam search, where the value model is crafted to assist the policy model (i.e., LLM) in navigating more effective reasoning paths, rather than solely relying on prior probabilities. The experimental results on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets demonstrate that even without GPT-4 or human-annotated process supervision, our AlphaMath framework achieves comparable or superior results to previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Overview of the EHRSQL 2024 Shared Task on Reliable Text-to-SQL Modeling on Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are relational databases that store the entire medical histories of patients within hospitals. They record numerous aspects of patients' medical care, from hospital admission and diagnosis to treatment and discharge. While EHRs are vital sources of clinical data, exploring them beyond a predefined set of queries requires skills in query languages like SQL. To make information retrieval more accessible, one strategy is to build a question-answering system, possibly leveraging text-to-SQL models that can automatically translate natural language questions into corresponding SQL queries and use these queries to retrieve the answers. The EHRSQL 2024 shared task aims to advance and promote research in developing a question-answering system for EHRs using text-to-SQL modeling, capable of reliably providing requested answers to various healthcare professionals to improve their clinical work processes and satisfy their needs. Among more than 100 participants who applied to the shared task, eight teams were formed and completed the entire shared task requirement and demonstrated a wide range of methods to effectively solve this task. In this paper, we describe the task of reliable text-to-SQL modeling, the dataset, and the methods and results of the participants. We hope this shared task will spur further research and insights into developing reliable question-answering systems for EHRs.</description>

      <title>AIOS Compiler: LLM as Interpreter for Natural Language Programming and Flow Programming of AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since their inception, programming languages have trended towards greater readability and lower barriers for programmers. Following this trend, natural language can be a promising type of programming language that provides great flexibility and usability and helps towards the democracy of programming. However, the inherent vagueness, ambiguity, and verbosity of natural language pose significant challenges in developing an interpreter that can accurately understand the programming logic and execute instructions written in natural language. Fortunately, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in interpreting complex natural language. Inspired by this, we develop a novel system for Code Representation and Execution (CoRE), which employs LLM as interpreter to interpret and execute natural language instructions. The proposed system unifies natural language programming, pseudo-code programming, and flow programming under the same representation for constructing language agents, while LLM serves as the interpreter to interpret and execute the agent programs. In this paper, we begin with defining the programming syntax that structures natural language instructions logically. During the execution, we incorporate external memory to minimize redundancy. Furthermore, we equip the designed interpreter with the capability to invoke external tools, compensating for the limitations of LLM in specialized domains or when accessing real-time information. This work is open-source at https://github.com/agiresearch/CoRE, https://github.com/agiresearch/OpenAGI, and https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.</description>

      <title>SPOR: A Comprehensive and Practical Evaluation Method for Compositional Generalization in Data-to-Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compositional generalization is an important ability of language models and has many different manifestations. For data-to-text generation, previous research on this ability is limited to a single manifestation called Systematicity and lacks consideration of large language models (LLMs), which cannot fully cover practical application scenarios. In this work, we propose SPOR, a comprehensive and practical evaluation method for compositional generalization in data-to-text generation. SPOR includes four aspects of manifestations (Systematicity, Productivity, Order invariance, and Rule learnability) and allows high-quality evaluation without additional manual annotations based on existing datasets. We demonstrate SPOR on two different datasets and evaluate some existing language models including LLMs. We find that the models are deficient in various aspects of the evaluation and need further improvement. Our work shows the necessity for comprehensive research on different manifestations of compositional generalization in data-to-text generation and provides a framework for evaluation.</description>

      <title>MBIAS: Mitigating Bias in Large Language Models While Retaining Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In addressing the critical need for safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to ensure that the outputs are not only safe but also retain their contextual accuracy. Many existing LLMs are safe fine-tuned either with safety demonstrations, or rely only on adversarial testing. While able to get safe outputs, they often risk losing contextual meaning as they mitigate bias and toxicity. In response, we present MBIAS, a LLM framework instruction fine-tuned on a custom dataset specifically designed for safety interventions. MBIAS aims to address the significant issues of bias and toxicity in LLMs generations that typically manifest as underrepresentation or negative portrayals across various demographics, including inappropriate linguistic mentions and biased content in social media. We experiment on MBIAS for safety interventions using various configurations, and demonstrate more than a 30\% reduction in overall bias and toxicity while successfully retaining key information. Additionally, a demographic analysis on an out-of-distribution test set confirms the robustness of our approach, with reductions in bias and toxicity exceeding 90\% across various demographics. The dataset and instruction fine-tuned MBIAS are made available to the research community at https://huggingface.co/newsmediabias/MBIAS.</description>

      <title>xFinder: Robust and Pinpoint Answer Extraction for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought increasing attention to the critical issue of developing fair and reliable methods for evaluating their performance. Particularly, the emergence of subjective or non-subjective cheating phenomena, such as test set leakage and prompt format overfitting, poses significant challenges to the reliable evaluation of LLMs. Since evaluation frameworks often utilize Regular Expression (RegEx) for answer extraction, some models may adjust their responses to comply with specific formats that are easily extractable by RegEx. Nevertheless, the key answer extraction module based on RegEx frequently suffers from extraction errors. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the entire LLM evaluation chain, demonstrating that optimizing the key answer extraction module can improve extraction accuracy, reduce LLMs' reliance on specific answer formats, and enhance the reliability of LLM evaluation. To address these issues, we propose xFinder, a model specifically designed for key answer extraction. As part of this process, we create a specialized dataset, the Key Answer Finder (KAF) dataset, to ensure effective model training and evaluation. Through generalization testing and evaluation in real-world scenarios, the results demonstrate that the smallest xFinder model with only 500 million parameters achieves an average answer extraction accuracy of 93.42%. In contrast, RegEx accuracy in the best evaluation framework is 74.38%. xFinder exhibits stronger robustness and higher accuracy compared to existing evaluation frameworks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Cartography-Based Curriculum Learning Method Applied on RoNLI: The First Romanian Natural Language Inference Corpus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural language inference (NLI), the task of recognizing the entailment relationship in sentence pairs, is an actively studied topic serving as a proxy for natural language understanding. Despite the relevance of the task in building conversational agents and improving text classification, machine translation and other NLP tasks, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available NLI corpus for the Romanian language. To this end, we introduce the first Romanian NLI corpus (RoNLI) comprising 58K training sentence pairs, which are obtained via distant supervision, and 6K validation and test sentence pairs, which are manually annotated with the correct labels. We conduct experiments with multiple machine learning methods based on distant learning, ranging from shallow models based on word embeddings to transformer-based neural networks, to establish a set of competitive baselines. Furthermore, we improve on the best model by employing a new curriculum learning strategy based on data cartography. Our dataset and code to reproduce the baselines are available at https://github.com/Eduard6421/RONLI.</description>

      <title>Mining the Explainability and Generalization: Fact Verification Based on Self-Instruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fact-checking based on commercial LLMs has become mainstream. Although these methods offer high explainability, it falls short in accuracy compared to traditional fine-tuning approaches, and data security is also a significant concern. In this paper, we propose a self-instruction based fine-tuning approach for fact-checking that balances accuracy and explainability. Our method consists of Data Augmentation and Improved DPO fine-tuning. The former starts by instructing the model to generate both positive and negative explanations based on claim-evidence pairs and labels, then sampling the dataset according to our customized difficulty standards. The latter employs our proposed improved DPO to fine-tune the model using the generated samples. We fine-tune the smallest-scale LLaMA-7B model and evaluate it on the challenging fact-checking datasets FEVEROUS and HOVER, utilizing four fine-tuning methods and three few-shot learning methods for comparison. The experiments demonstrate that our approach not only retains accuracy comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional fine-tuning methods, but also generates fluent explanation text. Moreover, it also exhibit high generalization performance. Our method is the first to leverage self-supervised learning for fact-checking and innovatively combines contrastive learning and improved DPO in fine-tuning LLMs, as shown in the experiments.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, multi-modal machine translation has attracted significant interest in both academia and industry due to its superior performance. It takes both textual and visual modalities as inputs, leveraging visual context to tackle the ambiguities in source texts. In this paper, we begin by offering an exhaustive overview of 99 prior works, comprehensively summarizing representative studies from the perspectives of dominant models, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Afterwards, we analyze the impact of various factors on model performance and finally discuss the possible research directions for this task in the future. Over time, multi-modal machine translation has developed more types to meet diverse needs. Unlike previous surveys confined to the early stage of multi-modal machine translation, our survey thoroughly concludes these emerging types from different aspects, so as to provide researchers with a better understanding of its current state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.09435v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bolukbasi et al. (2016) presents one of the first gender bias mitigation techniques for word representations. Their method takes pre-trained word representations as input and attempts to isolate a linear subspace that captures most of the gender bias in the representations. As judged by an analogical evaluation task, their method virtually eliminates gender bias in the representations. However, an implicit and untested assumption of their method is that the bias subspace is actually linear. In this work, we generalize their method to a kernelized, nonlinear version. We take inspiration from kernel principal component analysis and derive a nonlinear bias isolation technique. We discuss and overcome some of the practical drawbacks of our method for non-linear gender bias mitigation in word representations and analyze empirically whether the bias subspace is actually linear. Our analysis shows that gender bias is in fact well captured by a linear subspace, justifying the assumption of Bolukbasi et al. (2016).</description>

      <title>CompA: Addressing the Gap in Compositional Reasoning in Audio-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental characteristic of audio is its compositional nature. Audio-language models (ALMs) trained using a contrastive approach (e.g., CLAP) that learns a shared representation between audio and language modalities have improved performance in many downstream applications, including zero-shot audio classification, audio retrieval, etc. However, the ability of these models to effectively perform compositional reasoning remains largely unexplored and necessitates additional research. In this paper, we propose CompA, a collection of two expert-annotated benchmarks with a majority of real-world audio samples, to evaluate compositional reasoning in ALMs. Our proposed CompA-order evaluates how well an ALM understands the order or occurrence of acoustic events in audio, and CompA-attribute evaluates attribute-binding of acoustic events. An instance from either benchmark consists of two audio-caption pairs, where both audios have the same acoustic events but with different compositions. An ALM is evaluated on how well it matches the right audio to the right caption. Using this benchmark, we first show that current ALMs perform only marginally better than random chance, thereby struggling with compositional reasoning. Next, we propose CompA-CLAP, where we fine-tune CLAP using a novel learning method to improve its compositional reasoning abilities. To train CompA-CLAP, we first propose improvements to contrastive training with composition-aware hard negatives, allowing for more focused training. Next, we propose a novel modular contrastive loss that helps the model learn fine-grained compositional understanding and overcomes the acute scarcity of openly available compositional audios. CompA-CLAP significantly improves over all our baseline models on the CompA benchmark, indicating its superior compositional reasoning capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly, and companies are shifting their focus to developing generalist AI systems that can autonomously act and pursue goals. Increases in capabilities and autonomy may soon massively amplify AI's impact, with risks that include large-scale social harms, malicious uses, and an irreversible loss of human control over autonomous AI systems. Although researchers have warned of extreme risks from AI, there is a lack of consensus about how exactly such risks arise, and how to manage them. Society's response, despite promising first steps, is incommensurate with the possibility of rapid, transformative progress that is expected by many experts. AI safety research is lagging. Present governance initiatives lack the mechanisms and institutions to prevent misuse and recklessness, and barely address autonomous systems. In this short consensus paper, we describe extreme risks from upcoming, advanced AI systems. Drawing on lessons learned from other safety-critical technologies, we then outline a comprehensive plan combining technical research and development with proactive, adaptive governance mechanisms for a more commensurate preparation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Learn for Few-shot Continual Active Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning strives to ensure stability in solving previously seen tasks while demonstrating plasticity in a novel domain. Recent advances in CL are mostly confined to a supervised learning setting, especially in NLP domain. In this work, we consider a few-shot continual active learning (CAL) setting where labeled data are inadequate, and unlabeled data are abundant but with a limited annotation budget. We propose a simple but efficient method, Meta-Continual Active Learning. This method sequentially selects the most informative examples from a pool of unlabeled data and requests labels to enhance performance. Specifically, we employ meta-learning and experience replay to address inter-task confusion and catastrophic forgetting. We further incorporate textual augmentations to ensure generalization. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark text classification datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and analyze the effect of different active learning strategies in few-shot CAL setting. Our experimental results demonstrate that random sampling is the best default strategy for active learning and memory sample selection to solve few-shot CAL problems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Generative Ad Hoc Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled the development of viable generative retrieval systems. Instead of a traditional document ranking, generative retrieval systems often directly return a grounded generated text as a response to a query. Quantifying the utility of the textual responses is essential for appropriately evaluating such generative ad hoc retrieval. Yet, the established evaluation methodology for ranking-based ad hoc retrieval is not suited for the reliable and reproducible evaluation of generated responses. To lay a foundation for developing new evaluation methods for generative retrieval systems, we survey the relevant literature from the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing, identify search tasks and system architectures in generative retrieval, develop a new user model, and study its operationalization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pre-training for Localized Instruction Generation of Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Procedural videos, exemplified by recipe demonstrations, are instrumental in conveying step-by-step instructions. However, understanding such videos is challenging as it involves the precise localization of steps and the generation of textual instructions. Manually annotating steps and writing instructions is costly, which limits the size of current datasets and hinders effective learning. Leveraging large but noisy video-transcript datasets for pre-training can boost performance but demands significant computational resources. Furthermore, transcripts contain irrelevant content and differ in style from human-written instructions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel technique, Sieve-&amp;-Swap, to automatically generate high quality training data for the recipe domain: (i) Sieve filters irrelevant transcripts and (ii) Swap acquires high quality text by replacing transcripts with human-written instruction from a text-only recipe dataset. The resulting dataset is three orders of magnitude smaller than current web-scale datasets but enables efficient training of large-scale models. Alongside Sieve-&amp;-Swap, we propose Procedure Transformer (ProcX), a model for end-to-end step localization and instruction generation for procedural videos. When pre-trained on our curated dataset, this model achieves state-of-the-art performance on YouCook2 and Tasty while using a fraction of the training data. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method that uses a text-to-image model to generate consistent content across multiple image scales, enabling extreme semantic zooms into a scene, e.g., ranging from a wide-angle landscape view of a forest to a macro shot of an insect sitting on one of the tree branches. We achieve this through a joint multi-scale diffusion sampling approach that encourages consistency across different scales while preserving the integrity of each individual sampling process. Since each generated scale is guided by a different text prompt, our method enables deeper levels of zoom than traditional super-resolution methods that may struggle to create new contextual structure at vastly different scales. We compare our method qualitatively with alternative techniques in image super-resolution and outpainting, and show that our method is most effective at generating consistent multi-scale content.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Help Reveal Unhealthy Diet and Body Concerns in Online Eating Disorders Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eating disorders (ED), a severe mental health condition with high rates of mortality and morbidity, affect millions of people globally, especially adolescents. The proliferation of online communities that promote and normalize ED has been linked to this public health crisis. However, identifying harmful communities is challenging due to the use of coded language and other obfuscations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to surface implicit attitudes of online communities by adapting large language models (LLMs) to the language of the community. We describe an alignment method and evaluate results along multiple dimensions of semantics and affect. We then use the community-aligned LLM to respond to psychometric questionnaires designed to identify ED in individuals. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively adopt community-specific perspectives and reveal significant variations in eating disorder risks in different online communities. These findings highlight the utility of LLMs to reveal implicit attitudes and collective mindsets of communities, offering new tools for mitigating harmful content on social media.</description>

      <title>The Neglected Tails in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in zero-shot recognition but their performance varies greatly across different visual concepts. For example, although CLIP achieves impressive accuracy on ImageNet (60-80%), its performance drops below 10% for more than ten concepts like night snake, presumably due to their limited presence in the pretraining data. However, measuring the frequency of concepts in VLMs' large-scale datasets is challenging. We address this by using large language models (LLMs) to count the number of pretraining texts that contain synonyms of these concepts. Our analysis confirms that popular datasets, such as LAION, exhibit a long-tailed concept distribution, yielding biased performance in VLMs. We also find that downstream applications of VLMs, including visual chatbots (e.g., GPT-4V) and text-to-image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), often fail to recognize or generate images of rare concepts identified by our method. To mitigate the imbalanced performance of zero-shot VLMs, we propose REtrieval-Augmented Learning (REAL). First, instead of prompting VLMs using the original class names, REAL uses their most frequent synonyms found in pretraining texts. This simple change already outperforms costly human-engineered and LLM-enriched prompts over nine benchmark datasets. Second, REAL trains a linear classifier on a small yet balanced set of pretraining data retrieved using concept synonyms. REAL surpasses the previous zero-shot SOTA, using 400x less storage and 10,000x less training time!</description>

      <title>LocMoE: A Low-Overhead MoE for Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mixtures-of-Experts (MoE) model is a widespread distributed and integrated learning method for large language models (LLM), which is favored due to its ability to sparsify and expand models efficiently. However, the performance of MoE is limited by load imbalance and high latency of All-to-All communication, along with relatively redundant computation owing to large expert capacity. Load imbalance may result from existing routing policies that consistently tend to select certain experts. The frequent inter-node communication in the All-to-All procedure also significantly prolongs the training time. To alleviate the above performance problems, we propose a novel routing strategy that combines load balance and locality by converting partial inter-node communication to that of intra-node. Notably, we elucidate that there is a minimum threshold for expert capacity, calculated through the maximal angular deviation between the gating weights of the experts and the assigned tokens. We port these modifications on the PanGu-Sigma model based on the MindSpore framework with multi-level routing and conduct experiments on Ascend clusters. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed LocMoE reduces training time per epoch by 12.68% to 22.24% compared to classical routers, such as hash router and switch router, without impacting the model accuracy.</description>

      <title>Improving Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Efficient Reward Model Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted approach for aligning large language models with human values. However, RLHF relies on a reward model that is trained with a limited amount of human preference data, which could lead to inaccurate predictions. As a result, RLHF may produce outputs that are misaligned with human values. To mitigate this issue, we contribute a reward ensemble method that allows the reward model to make more accurate predictions. As using an ensemble of large language model-based reward models can be computationally and resource-expensive, we explore efficient ensemble methods including linear-layer ensemble and LoRA-based ensemble. Empirically, we run Best-of-$n$ and Proximal Policy Optimization with our ensembled reward models, and verify that our ensemble methods help improve the alignment performance of RLHF outputs.</description>

      <title>AutoTimes: Autoregressive Time Series Forecasters via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models of time series have not been fully developed due to the limited availability of time series corpora and the underexploration of scalable pre-training. Based on the similar sequential formulation of time series and natural language, increasing research demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLM) for time series. Nevertheless, the inherent autoregressive property and decoder-only architecture of LLMs have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLM abilities. To further exploit the general-purpose token transition and multi-step generation ability of large language models, we propose AutoTimes to repurpose LLMs as autoregressive time series forecasters, which independently projects time series segments into the embedding space and autoregressively generates future predictions with arbitrary lengths. Compatible with any decoder-only LLMs, the consequent forecaster exhibits the flexibility of the lookback length and scalability of the LLM size. Further, we formulate time series as prompts, extending the context for prediction beyond the lookback window, termed in-context forecasting. By adopting textual timestamps as position embeddings, AutoTimes integrates multimodality for multivariate scenarios. Empirically, AutoTimes achieves state-of-the-art with 0.1% trainable parameters and over 5 times training/inference speedup compared to advanced LLM-based forecasters.</description>

      <title>Measuring Implicit Bias in Explicitly Unbiased Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two new measures of bias: LLM Implicit Bias, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Implicit Bias adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Decision Bias operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). Our prompt-based LLM Implicit Bias measure correlates with existing language model embedding-based bias methods, but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias. These new prompt-based measures draw from psychology's long history of research into measuring stereotype biases based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>CogCoM: Train Large Vision-Language Models Diving into Details through Chain of Manipulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated their broad effectiveness thanks to extensive training in aligning visual instructions to responses. However, such training of conclusive alignment leads models to ignore essential visual reasoning, further resulting in failures in meticulous visual problems and unfaithful responses. Drawing inspiration from human cognition in solving visual problems (e.g., marking, zoom in), this paper introduces Chain of Manipulations, a mechanism that enables VLMs to solve problems step-by-step with evidence. After training, models can solve various visual problems by eliciting intrinsic manipulations (e.g., grounding, zoom in) with results (e.g., boxes, image) actively without involving external tools, while also allowing users to trace error causes. We study the roadmap to implement this mechanism, including (1) a flexible design of manipulations upon extensive analysis, (2) an efficient automated data generation pipeline, (3) a compatible VLM architecture capable of multi-turn multi-image, and (4) a model training process for versatile capabilities. With the design, we also manually annotate 6K high-quality samples for the challenging graphical mathematical problems. Our trained model, \textbf{CogCoM}, equipped with this mechanism with 17B parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance across 9 benchmarks from 4 categories, demonstrating the effectiveness while preserving the interpretability. Our code, model weights, and collected data are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/CogCoM.</description>

      <title>L4Q: Parameter Efficient Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the high memory and computational costs associated with Large Language Models, model compression via quantization and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), are gaining popularity. This has led to active research on quantization-aware PEFT techniques, which aim to create models with high accuracy and low memory overhead. Among quantization methods, post-training quantization (PTQ) is more commonly used in previous works than quantization-aware training (QAT), despite QAT's potential for higher accuracy. This preference is due to PTQ's low training overhead. However, PTQ-based PEFT methods often utilize high-precision parameters, making it difficult to fully exploit the efficiency of quantization. Additionally, they have limited adaptation ability due to a reduced and constrained LoRA parameter structure. To overcome these challenges, we propose L4Q, which leverages joint quantization and fine-tuning to reduce QAT's memory overhead and produce models that consist entirely of quantized weights while achieving effective adaptation to downstream tasks. By design, L4Q allows quantization parameters to reflect weight updates, while weight updates reduce quantization errors. Our experiments demonstrate that this coupled quantization and fine-tuning approach yields superior accuracy compared to decoupled fine-tuning schemes in sub-4-bit quantization. Using the LLaMA model families and instructional datasets, we showcase L4Q's capabilities in language tasks and few-shot in-context learning.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Spatial Optimization with Large Language Models for Open-Domain Urban Itinerary Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP), a paradigm designed to generate personalized urban itineraries from user requests articulated in natural language. This approach is different from traditional itinerary planning, which often restricts the granularity of user inputs, thus hindering genuine personalization. To this end, we present ItiNera, an OUIP system that synergizes spatial optimization with large language models (LLMs) to provide services that customize urban itineraries based on users' needs. Upon receiving the user's itinerary request, the LLM first decomposes it into detailed components, identifying key requirements, including preferences and dislikes. Then, we use these specifics to select candidate POIs from a large-scale collection using embedding-based Preference-aware POI Retrieval. Finally, a preference score-based Cluster-aware Spatial Optimization module clusters, filters, and orders these POIs, followed by the LLM for detailed POI selection and organization to craft a personalized, spatially coherent itinerary. Moreover, we created an LLM-based pipeline to update and personalize a user-owned POI database. This ensures up-to-date POI information, supports itinerary planning, pre-trip research, POI collection, recommendations, and more. To the best of our knowledge, this study marks the first integration of LLMs to innovate itinerary planning, with potential extensions for various urban travel and exploration activities. Offline and online evaluations demonstrate the capacity of our system to deliver more responsive, personalized, and spatially coherent itineraries than current solutions. Our system, deployed on an online platform, has attracted thousands of users for their urban travel planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07939v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce UFO, an innovative UI-Focused agent to fulfill user requests tailored to applications on Windows OS, harnessing the capabilities of GPT-Vision. UFO employs a dual-agent framework to meticulously observe and analyze the graphical user interface (GUI) and control information of Windows applications. This enables the agent to seamlessly navigate and operate within individual applications and across them to fulfill user requests, even when spanning multiple applications. The framework incorporates a control interaction module, facilitating action grounding without human intervention and enabling fully automated execution. Consequently, UFO transforms arduous and time-consuming processes into simple tasks achievable solely through natural language commands. We conducted testing of UFO across 9 popular Windows applications, encompassing a variety of scenarios reflective of users' daily usage. The results, derived from both quantitative metrics and real-case studies, underscore the superior effectiveness of UFO in fulfilling user requests. To the best of our knowledge, UFO stands as the first UI agent specifically tailored for task completion within the Windows OS environment. The open-source code for UFO is available on https://github.com/microsoft/UFO.</description>

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have witnessed significant advancement in various tasks, including mathematical reasoning and theorem proving. As these two tasks require strict and formal multi-step inference, they are appealing domains for exploring the reasoning ability of LLMs but still face important challenges. Previous studies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have revealed the effectiveness of intermediate steps guidance. However, such step-wise annotation requires heavy labor, leading to insufficient training steps for current benchmarks. To fill this gap, this work introduces MUSTARD, a data generation framework that masters uniform synthesis of theorem and proof data of high quality and diversity. MUSTARD synthesizes data in three stages: (1) It samples a few mathematical concept seeds as the problem category. (2) Then, it prompts a generative language model with the sampled concepts to obtain both the problems and their step-wise formal solutions. (3) Lastly, the framework utilizes a proof assistant (e.g., Lean Prover) to filter the valid proofs. With the proposed MUSTARD, we present a theorem-and-proof benchmark MUSTARDSAUCE with 5,866 valid data points. Each data point contains an informal statement, an informal proof, and a translated formal proof that passes the prover validation. We perform extensive analysis and demonstrate that MUSTARD generates validated high-quality step-by-step data. We further apply the MUSTARDSAUCE for fine-tuning smaller language models. The fine-tuned Llama 2-7B achieves a 15.41% average relative performance gain in automated theorem proving, and 8.18% in math word problems.

      <title>SPAR: Personalized Content-Based Recommendation via Long Engagement Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging users' long engagement histories is essential for personalized content recommendations. The success of pretrained language models (PLMs) in NLP has led to their use in encoding user histories and candidate items, framing content recommendations as textual semantic matching tasks. However, existing works still struggle with processing very long user historical text and insufficient user-item interaction. In this paper, we introduce a content-based recommendation framework, SPAR, which effectively tackles the challenges of holistic user interest extraction from the long user engagement history. It achieves so by leveraging PLM, poly-attention layers and attention sparsity mechanisms to encode user's history in a session-based manner. The user and item side features are sufficiently fused for engagement prediction while maintaining standalone representations for both sides, which is efficient for practical model deployment. Moreover, we enhance user profiling by exploiting large language model (LLM) to extract global interests from user engagement history. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Urban Residents: An LLM Agent Framework for Personal Mobility Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into an agent framework for flexible and effective personal mobility generation. LLMs overcome the limitations of previous models by effectively processing semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various tasks. Our approach addresses three research questions: aligning LLMs with real-world urban mobility data, developing reliable activity generation strategies, and exploring LLM applications in urban mobility. The key technical contribution is a novel LLM agent framework that accounts for individual activity patterns and motivations, including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with real-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy for interpretable activity generation. We evaluate our LLM agent framework and compare it with state-of-the-art personal mobility generation approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and its potential applications in urban mobility. Overall, this study marks the pioneering work of designing an LLM agent framework for activity generation based on real-world human activity data, offering a promising tool for urban mobility analysis.</description>

      <title>A First Look at GPT Apps: Landscape and Vulnerability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of GPTs, a surge in GPT apps has led to the launch of dedicated LLM app stores. Nevertheless, given its debut, there is a lack of sufficient understanding of this new ecosystem. To fill this gap, this paper presents a first comprehensive longitudinal (5-month) study of the evolution, landscape, and vulnerability of the emerging LLM app ecosystem, focusing on two GPT app stores: \textit{GPTStore.AI} and the official \textit{OpenAI GPT Store}. Specifically, we develop two automated tools and a TriLevel configuration extraction strategy to efficiently gather metadata (\ie names, creators, descriptions, \etc) and user feedback for all GPT apps across these two stores, as well as configurations (\ie system prompts, knowledge files, and APIs) for the top 10,000 popular apps. Our extensive analysis reveals: (1) the user enthusiasm for GPT apps consistently rises, whereas creator interest plateaus within three months of GPTs' launch; (2) nearly 90\% system prompts can be easily accessed due to widespread failure to secure GPT app configurations, leading to considerable plagiarism and duplication among apps. Our findings highlight the necessity of enhancing the LLM app ecosystem by the app stores, creators, and users.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Powered Ranking of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models are often ranked according to their level of alignment with human preferences -- a model is better than other models if its outputs are more frequently preferred by humans. One of the popular ways to elicit human preferences utilizes pairwise comparisons between the outputs provided by different models to the same inputs. However, since gathering pairwise comparisons by humans is costly and time-consuming, it has become a common practice to gather pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model -- a model strongly aligned with human preferences. Surprisingly, practitioners cannot currently measure the uncertainty that any mismatch between human and model preferences may introduce in the constructed rankings. In this work, we develop a statistical framework to bridge this gap. Given a (small) set of pairwise comparisons by humans and a large set of pairwise comparisons by a model, our framework provides a rank-set -- a set of possible ranking positions -- for each of the models under comparison. Moreover, it guarantees that, with a probability greater than or equal to a user-specified value, the rank-sets cover the true ranking consistent with the distribution of human pairwise preferences asymptotically. Using pairwise comparisons made by humans in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform and pairwise comparisons made by three strong large language models, we empirically demonstrate the effectivity of our framework and show that the rank-sets constructed using only pairwise comparisons by the strong large language models are often inconsistent with (the distribution of) human pairwise preferences.</description>

      <title>CALF: Aligning LLMs for Time Series Forecasting via Cross-modal Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (e.g., Transformer) has been widely and successfully used in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). Unlike existing methods that focus on training models from a single modal of time series input, large language models (LLMs) based MTSF methods with cross-modal text and time series input have recently shown great superiority, especially with limited temporal data. However, current LLM-based MTSF methods usually focus on adapting and fine-tuning LLMs, while neglecting the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal input tokens, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal LLM Fine-Tuning (CALF) framework for MTSF by reducing the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal data, which mainly consists of the temporal target branch with temporal input and the textual source branch with aligned textual input. To reduce the distribution discrepancy, we develop the cross-modal match module to first align cross-modal input distributions. Additionally, to minimize the modality distribution gap in both feature and output spaces, feature regularization loss is developed to align the intermediate features between the two branches for better weight updates, while output consistency loss is introduced to allow the output representations of both branches to correspond effectively. Thanks to the modality alignment, CALF establishes state-of-the-art performance for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with low computational complexity, and exhibiting favorable few-shot and zero-shot abilities similar to that in LLMs. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Hank0626/LLaTA}.</description>

      <title>Embodied LLM Agents Learn to Cooperate in Organized Teams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as integral tools for reasoning, planning, and decision-making, drawing upon their extensive world knowledge and proficiency in language-related tasks. LLMs thus hold tremendous potential for natural language interaction within multi-agent systems to foster cooperation. However, LLM agents tend to over-report and comply with any instruction, which may result in information redundancy and confusion in multi-agent cooperation. Inspired by human organizations, this paper introduces a framework that imposes prompt-based organization structures on LLM agents to mitigate these problems. Through a series of experiments with embodied LLM agents and human-agent collaboration, our results highlight the impact of designated leadership on team efficiency, shedding light on the leadership qualities displayed by LLM agents and their spontaneous cooperative behaviors. Further, we harness the potential of LLMs to propose enhanced organizational prompts, via a Criticize-Reflect process, resulting in novel organization structures that reduce communication costs and enhance team efficiency.</description>

      <title>AutoTRIZ: Artificial Ideation with TRIZ and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers and innovators have made enormous efforts in developing ideation methods, such as morphological analysis and design-by-analogy, to aid engineering design ideation for problem solving and innovation. Among these, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) stands out as one of the most well-known approaches, widely applied for systematic innovation. However, the complexity of TRIZ resources and concepts, coupled with its reliance on users' knowledge, experience, and reasoning capabilities, limits its practicality. Therefore, we explore the recent advances of large language models (LLMs) for a generative approach to bridge this gap. This paper proposes AutoTRIZ, an artificial ideation tool that uses LLMs to automate and enhance the TRIZ methodology. By leveraging the broad knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs, AutoTRIZ offers a novel approach for design automation and interpretable ideation with artificial intelligence. AutoTRIZ takes a problem statement from the user as its initial input, and automatically generates a solution report after the reasoning process. We demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of AutoTRIZ through consistency experiments in contradiction detection, and a case study comparing solutions generated by AutoTRIZ with the experts' analyses from the textbook. Moreover, the proposed LLM-based framework holds the potential for extension to automate other knowledge-based ideation methods, including SCAMPER, Design Heuristics, and Design-by-Analogy, paving the way for a new era of artificial ideation for design innovation.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-PruMerge: Adaptive Token Reduction for Efficient Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15388v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant visual reasoning capabilities by connecting a visual encoder and a large language model. LMMs typically take in a fixed and large amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the CLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more complex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which further increases the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the inherent design of the Transformer architecture, the computational costs of these models tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To tackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism that identifies significant spatial redundancy among visual tokens. In response, we propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction strategy that significantly reduces the number of visual tokens without compromising the performance of LMMs. Specifically, to metric the importance of each token, we exploit the sparsity observed in the visual encoder, characterized by the sparse distribution of attention scores between the class token and visual tokens. This sparsity enables us to dynamically select the most crucial visual tokens to retain. Subsequently, we cluster the selected (unpruned) tokens based on their key similarity and merge them with the unpruned tokens, effectively supplementing and enhancing their informational content. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-1.5, our approach can compress the visual tokens by 14 times on average, and achieve comparable performance across diverse visual question-answering and reasoning tasks.

      <title>Who Evaluates the Evaluations? Objectively Scoring Text-to-Image Prompt Coherence Metrics with T2IScoreScore (TS2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With advances in the quality of text-to-image (T2I) models has come interest in benchmarking their prompt faithfulness-the semantic coherence of generated images to the prompts they were conditioned on. A variety of T2I faithfulness metrics have been proposed, leveraging advances in cross-modal embeddings and vision-language models (VLMs). However, these metrics are not rigorously compared and benchmarked, instead presented with correlation to human Likert scores over a set of easy-to-discriminate images against seemingly weak baselines.
  We introduce T2IScoreScore (TS2), a curated set of semantic error graphs containing a prompt and a set increasingly erroneous images. These allow us to rigorously judge whether a given prompt faithfulness metric can correctly order images with respect to their objective error count and significantly discriminate between different error nodes, using meta-metric scores derived from established statistical tests. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art VLM-based metrics (e.g., TIFA, DSG, LLMScore, VIEScore) we tested fail to significantly outperform simple (and supposedly worse) feature-based metrics like CLIPScore, particularly on a hard subset of naturally-occurring T2I model errors. TS2 will enable the development of better T2I prompt faithfulness metrics through more rigorous comparison of their conformity to expected orderings and separations under objective criteria.</description>

      <title>Many-Shot In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) -- learning from a few examples provided in context at inference, without any weight updates. Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples -- the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated examples. To mitigate this limitation, we explore two new settings: Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL. Reinforced ICL uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of human examples. Unsupervised ICL removes rationales from the prompt altogether, and prompts the model only with domain-specific questions. We find that both Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be quite effective in the many-shot regime, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases, can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs, and performs comparably to fine-tuning. Our analysis also reveals the limitations of next-token prediction loss as an indicator of downstream ICL performance.</description>

      <title>Stepwise Alignment for Constrained Language Model Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety and trustworthiness are indispensable requirements for real-world applications of AI systems using large language models (LLMs). This paper formulates human value alignment as an optimization problem of the language model policy to maximize reward under a safety constraint, and then proposes an algorithm, Stepwise Alignment for Constrained Policy Optimization (SACPO). One key idea behind SACPO, supported by theory, is that the optimal policy incorporating reward and safety can be directly obtained from a reward-aligned policy. Building on this key idea, SACPO aligns LLMs step-wise with each metric while leveraging simple yet powerful alignment algorithms such as direct preference optimization (DPO). SACPO offers several advantages, including simplicity, stability, computational efficiency, and flexibility of algorithms and datasets. Under mild assumptions, our theoretical analysis provides the upper bounds on optimality and safety constraint violation. Our experimental results show that SACPO can fine-tune Alpaca-7B better than the state-of-the-art method in terms of both helpfulness and harmlessness.</description>

      <title>Towards General Conceptual Model Editing via Adversarial Representation Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success, understanding and controlling their internal complex mechanisms has become an urgent problem. Recent research has attempted to interpret their behaviors through the lens of inner representation. However, developing practical and efficient methods for applying these representations for general and flexible model editing remains challenging. In this work, we explore how to use representation engineering methods to guide the editing of LLMs by deploying a representation sensor as an oracle. We first identify the importance of a robust and reliable sensor during editing, then propose an Adversarial Representation Engineering (ARE) framework to provide a unified and interpretable approach for conceptual model editing without compromising baseline performance. Experiments on multiple model editing paradigms demonstrate the effectiveness of ARE in various settings. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Zhang-Yihao/Adversarial-Representation-Engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are the natural evolution of LLMs, and enlarge their capabilities so as to work beyond the pure textual modality. As research is being carried out to design novel architectures and vision-and-language adapters, in this paper we concentrate on endowing such models with the capability of answering questions that require external knowledge. Our approach, termed Wiki-LLaVA, aims at integrating an external knowledge source of multimodal documents, which is accessed through a hierarchical retrieval pipeline. Relevant passages, using this approach, are retrieved from the external knowledge source and employed as additional context for the LLM, augmenting the effectiveness and precision of generated dialogues. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets tailored for visual question answering with external data and demonstrate the appropriateness of our approach.</description>

Abstract: The open-source community is experiencing a surge in the release of large language models (LLMs) that are trained to follow instructions and align with human preference. However, further training to improve them still requires expensive computational resources and data annotations. Is it possible to bypass additional training and cost-effectively acquire better-aligned models? Inspired by the literature on model interpolation, we propose a simple method called ExPO to boost LLMs' alignment with human preference. Utilizing a model that has undergone alignment training (e.g., via DPO or RLHF) and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO directly obtains a better-aligned model by extrapolating from the weights of the initial and the aligned models, which implicitly optimizes the alignment objective via first-order approximation. Through experiments with twelve open-source LLMs on HuggingFace, we demonstrate that ExPO consistently improves off-the-shelf DPO/RLHF models, as evaluated on the mainstream LLM benchmarks AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench. Moreover, ExPO exhibits remarkable scalability across various model sizes (from 1.8B to 70B) and capabilities. Through controlled experiments and further empirical analyses, we shed light on the essence of ExPO amplifying the reward signal learned during alignment training. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of model extrapolation in expediting the alignment of LLMs with human preference, suggesting a promising direction for future research.</description>

      <title>Self-Play Probabilistic Preference Optimization for Language Model Alignment</title>

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches relying on parametric models like the Bradley-Terry model fall short in capturing the intransitivity and irrationality in human preferences. Recent advancements suggest that directly working with preference probabilities can yield a more accurate reflection of human preferences, enabling more flexible and accurate language model alignment. In this paper, we propose a self-play-based method for language model alignment, which treats the problem as a constant-sum two-player game aimed at identifying the Nash equilibrium policy. Our approach, dubbed \textit{Self-play Probabilistic Preference Optimization} (SPPO), approximates the Nash equilibrium through iterative policy updates and enjoys a theoretical convergence guarantee. Our method can effectively increase the log-likelihood of the chosen response and decrease that of the rejected response, which cannot be trivially achieved by symmetric pairwise loss such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Identity Preference Optimization (IPO). In our experiments, using only 60k prompts (without responses) from the UltraFeedback dataset and without any prompt augmentation, by leveraging a pre-trained preference model PairRM with only 0.4B parameters, SPPO can obtain a model from fine-tuning Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 that achieves the state-of-the-art length-controlled win-rate of 28.53\% against GPT-4-Turbo on AlpacaEval 2.0. It also outperforms the (iterative) DPO and IPO on MT-Bench and the Open LLM Leaderboard. Notably, the strong performance of SPPO is achieved without additional external supervision (e.g., responses, preferences, etc.) from GPT-4 or other stronger language models.</description>

      <title>Federated Document Visual Question Answering: A Pilot Study</title>

Abstract: An important handicap of document analysis research is that documents tend to be copyrighted or contain private information, which prohibits their open publication and the creation of centralised, large-scale document datasets. Instead, documents are scattered in private data silos, making extensive training over heterogeneous data a tedious task. In this work, we explore the use of a federated learning (FL) scheme as a way to train a shared model on decentralised private document data. We focus on the problem of Document VQA, a task particularly suited to this approach, as the type of reasoning capabilities required from the model can be quite different in diverse domains. Enabling training over heterogeneous document datasets can thus substantially enrich DocVQA models. We assemble existing DocVQA datasets from diverse domains to reflect the data heterogeneity in real-world applications. We explore the self-pretraining technique in this multi-modal setting, where the same data is used for both pretraining and finetuning, making it relevant for privacy preservation. We further propose combining self-pretraining with a Federated DocVQA training method using centralized adaptive optimization that outperforms the FedAvg baseline. With extensive experiments, we also present a multi-faceted analysis on training DocVQA models with FL, which provides insights for future research on this task. We show that our pretraining strategies can effectively learn and scale up under federated training with diverse DocVQA datasets and tuning hyperparameters is essential for practical document tasks under federation.</description>

      <title>AgentClinic: a multimodal agent benchmark to evaluate AI in simulated clinical environments</title>

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing a patient is a complex, sequential decision making process that requires physicians to obtain information -- such as which tests to perform -- and to act upon it. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) promise to profoundly impact clinical care. However, current evaluation schemes overrely on static medical question-answering benchmarks, falling short on interactive decision-making that is required in real-life clinical work. Here, we present AgentClinic: a multimodal benchmark to evaluate LLMs in their ability to operate as agents in simulated clinical environments. In our benchmark, the doctor agent must uncover the patient's diagnosis through dialogue and active data collection. We present two open medical agent benchmarks: a multimodal image and dialogue environment, AgentClinic-NEJM, and a dialogue-only environment, AgentClinic-MedQA. We embed cognitive and implicit biases both in patient and doctor agents to emulate realistic interactions between biased agents. We find that introducing bias leads to large reductions in diagnostic accuracy of the doctor agents, as well as reduced compliance, confidence, and follow-up consultation willingness in patient agents. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that several models that excel in benchmarks like MedQA are performing poorly in AgentClinic-MedQA. We find that the LLM used in the patient agent is an important factor for performance in the AgentClinic benchmark. We show that both having limited interactions as well as too many interaction reduces diagnostic accuracy in doctor agents. The code and data for this work is publicly available at https://AgentClinic.github.io.</description>
