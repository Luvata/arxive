      <title>Network Traffic Analysis with Process Mining: The UPSIDE Case Study</title>

Abstract: Online gaming is a popular activity involving the adoption of complex systems and network infrastructures. The relevance of gaming, which generates large amounts of market revenue, drove research in modeling network devices' behavior to evaluate bandwidth consumption, predict and sustain high loads, and detect malicious activity. In this context, process mining appears promising due to its ability to combine data-driven analyses with model-based insights. In this paper, we propose a process mining-based method that analyzes gaming network traffic, allowing: unsupervised characterization of different states from gaming network data; encoding such states through process mining into interpretable Petri nets; and classification of gaming network traffic data to identify different video games being played. We apply the method to the UPSIDE case study, involving gaming network data of several devices interacting with two video games: Clash Royale and Rocket League. Results demonstrate that the gaming network behavior can be effectively and interpretably modeled through states represented as Petri nets with sufficient coherence (94.02% inter-device similarity) and specificity (174.99% inter-state separation) while maintaining a good classification accuracy of the two different video games (73.84% AUC).</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Deep Learning Model Fixing Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has been widely adopted in diverse industrial domains, including autonomous driving, intelligent healthcare, and aided programming. Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects. These insights highlight promising directions for future exploration in this field.</description>

      <title>A Review of Diffusion-based Simulation-Based Inference: Foundations and Applications in Non-Ideal Data Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For complex simulation problems, inferring parameters of scientific interest often precludes the use of classical likelihood-based techniques due to intractable likelihood functions. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\mathbf{\theta}$ given observed data $\mathbf{x}_{\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.</description>

      <title>Coordinate Matrix Machine: A Human-level Concept Learning to Classify Very Similar Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-level concept learning argues that humans typically learn new concepts from a single example, whereas machine learning algorithms typically require hundreds of samples to learn a single concept. Our brain subconsciously identifies important features and learns more effectively. \vspace*{6pt}
  Contribution: In this paper, we present the Coordinate Matrix Machine (CM$^2$). This purpose-built small model augments human intelligence by learning document structures and using this information to classify documents. While modern "Red AI" trends rely on massive pre-training and energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, CM$^2$ is designed as a Green AI solution. It achieves human-level concept learning by identifying only the structural "important features" a human would consider, allowing it to classify very similar documents using only one sample per class.
  Advantage: Our algorithm outperforms traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models that require larger datasets and significant compute. By focusing on structural coordinates rather than exhaustive semantic vectors, CM$^2$ offers: 1. High accuracy with minimal data (one-shot learning) 2. Geometric and structural intelligence 3. Green AI and environmental sustainability 4. Optimized for CPU-only environments 5. Inherent explainability (glass-box model) 6. Faster computation and low latency 7. Robustness against unbalanced classes 8. Economic viability 9. Generic, expandable, and extendable</description>

      <title>Geometric Scaling of Bayesian Inference in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that small transformers trained in controlled "wind-tunnel'' settings can implement exact Bayesian inference, and that their training dynamics produce a geometric substrate -- low-dimensional value manifolds and progressively orthogonal keys -- that encodes posterior structure. We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.
  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.</description>

      <title>Generalized Regularized Evidential Deep Learning Models: Theory and Comprehensive Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidential deep learning (EDL) models, based on Subjective Logic, introduce a principled and computationally efficient way to make deterministic neural networks uncertainty-aware. The resulting evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using learned evidence. However, the Subjective-Logic framework constrains evidence to be non-negative, requiring specific activation functions whose geometric properties can induce activation-dependent learning-freeze behavior: a regime where gradients become extremely small for samples mapped into low-evidence regions. We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark classification problems (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), two few-shot classification problems, and blind face restoration problem empirically validate the developed theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generalized regularized evidential models.</description>

      <title>HINTS: Extraction of Human Insights from Time-Series Without External Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human decision-making, emotions, and collective psychology are complex factors that shape the temporal dynamics observed in financial and economic systems. Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, multiple case studies and ablation studies validate the interpretability of HINTS, demonstrating strong semantic alignment between the extracted factors and real-world events, demonstrating the practical utility of HINTS.</description>

      <title>Learning Coupled System Dynamics under Incomplete Physical Constraints and Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in data acquisition and computational methods have accelerated the use of differential equation based modelling for complex systems. Such systems are often described by coupled (or more) variables, yet governing equation is typically available for one variable, while the remaining variable can be accessed only through data. This mismatch between known physics and observed data poses a fundamental challenge for existing physics-informed machine learning approaches, which generally assume either complete knowledge of the governing equations or full data availability across all variables. In this paper, we introduce MUSIC (Multitask Learning Under Sparse and Incomplete Constraints), a sparsity induced multitask neural network framework that integrates partial physical constraints with data-driven learning to recover full-dimensional solutions of coupled systems when physics-constrained and data-informed variables are mutually exclusive. MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency. We demonstrate that MUSIC accurately learns solutions (shock wave solutions, discontinuous solutions, pattern formation solutions) to complex coupled systems under data-scarce and noisy conditions, consistently outperforming non-sparse formulations. These results highlight MUSIC as a flexible and effective approach for modeling partially observed systems with incomplete physical knowledge.</description>

      <title>Drift-Based Dataset Stability Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) represents an efficient and popular approach for network traffic classification. However, network traffic classification is a challenging domain, and trained models may degrade soon after deployment due to the obsolete datasets and quick evolution of computer networks as new or updated protocols appear. Moreover, significant change in the behavior of a traffic type (and, therefore, the underlying features representing the traffic) can produce a large and sudden performance drop of the deployed model, known as a data or concept drift. In most cases, complete retraining is performed, often without further investigation of root causes, as good dataset quality is assumed. However, this is not always the case and further investigation must be performed. This paper proposes a novel methodology to evaluate the stability of datasets and a benchmark workflow that can be used to compare datasets.
  The proposed framework is based on a concept drift detection method that also uses ML feature weights to boost the detection performance. The benefits of this work are demonstrated on CESNET-TLS-Year22 dataset. We provide the initial dataset stability benchmark that is used to describe dataset stability and weak points to identify the next steps for optimization. Lastly, using the proposed benchmarking methodology, we show the optimization impact on the created dataset variants.</description>

      <title>Neural Optimal Design of Experiment for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Neural Optimal Design of Experiments, a learning-based framework for optimal experimental design in inverse problems that avoids classical bilevel optimization and indirect sparsity regularization. NODE jointly trains a neural reconstruction model and a fixed-budget set of continuous design variables representing sensor locations, sampling times, or measurement angles, within a single optimization loop. By optimizing measurement locations directly rather than weighting a dense grid of candidates, the proposed approach enforces sparsity by design, eliminates the need for l1 tuning, and substantially reduces computational complexity. We validate NODE on an analytically tractable exponential growth benchmark, on MNIST image sampling, and illustrate its effectiveness on a real world sparse view X ray CT example. In all cases, NODE outperforms baseline approaches, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy and task-specific performance.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cumulative Effects in Survival Data Using Deep Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In epidemiological research, modeling the cumulative effects of time-dependent exposures on survival outcomes presents a challenge due to their intricate temporal dynamics. Conventional spline-based statistical methods, though effective, require repeated data transformation for each spline parameter tuning, with survival analysis computations relying on the entire dataset, posing difficulties for large datasets. Meanwhile, existing neural network-based survival analysis methods focus on accuracy but often overlook the interpretability of cumulative exposure patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce CENNSurv, a novel deep learning approach that captures dynamic risk relationships from time-dependent data. Evaluated on two diverse real-world datasets, CENNSurv revealed a multi-year lagged association between chronic environmental exposure and a critical survival outcome, as well as a critical short-term behavioral shift prior to subscription lapse. This demonstrates CENNSurv's ability to model complex temporal patterns with improved scalability. CENNSurv provides researchers studying cumulative effects a practical tool with interpretable insights.</description>

      <title>A Granular Grassmannian Clustering Framework via the Schubert Variety of Best Fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many classification and clustering tasks, it is useful to compute a geometric representative for a dataset or a cluster, such as a mean or median. When datasets are represented by subspaces, these representatives become points on the Grassmann or flag manifold, with distances induced by their geometry, often via principal angles. We introduce a subspace clustering algorithm that replaces subspace means with a trainable prototype defined as a Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction. Integrated in the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline, this SVBF-LBG scheme yields improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video action data, while retaining the mathematical structure required for downstream analysis.</description>

      <title>Enabling Physical AI at the Edge: Hardware-Accelerated Recovery of System Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical AI at the edge -- enabling autonomous systems to understand and predict real-world dynamics in real time -- requires hardware-efficient learning and inference. Model recovery (MR), which identifies governing equations from sensor data, is a key primitive for safe and explainable monitoring in mission-critical autonomous systems operating under strict latency, compute, and power constraints. However, state-of-the-art MR methods (e.g., EMILY and PINN+SR) rely on Neural ODE formulations that require iterative solvers and are difficult to accelerate efficiently on edge hardware. We present \textbf{MERINDA} (Model Recovery in Reconfigurable Dynamic Architecture), an FPGA-accelerated MR framework designed to make physical AI practical on resource-constrained devices. MERINDA replaces expensive Neural ODE components with a hardware-friendly formulation that combines (i) GRU-based discretized dynamics, (ii) dense inverse-ODE layers, (iii) sparsity-driven dropout, and (iv) lightweight ODE solvers. The resulting computation is structured for streaming parallelism, enabling critical kernels to be fully parallelized on the FPGA. Across four benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, MERINDA delivers substantial gains over GPU implementations: \textbf{114$\times$ lower energy} (434~J vs.\ 49{,}375~J), \textbf{28$\times$ smaller memory footprint} (214~MB vs.\ 6{,}118~MB), and \textbf{1.68$\times$ faster training}, while matching state-of-the-art model-recovery accuracy. These results demonstrate that MERINDA can bring accurate, explainable MR to the edge for real-time monitoring of autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Safety-Biased Policy Optimisation: Towards Hard-Constrained Reinforcement Learning via Trust Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical domains requires agents to maximise rewards while strictly adhering to safety constraints. Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned. Experiments on standard and challenging Safety Gymnasium tasks show that SB-TRPO consistently achieves the best balance of safety and meaningful task completion compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>FineFT: Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Futures are contracts obligating the exchange of an asset at a predetermined date and price, notable for their high leverage and liquidity and, therefore, thrive in the Crypto market. RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance.</description>

      <title>TabMixNN: A Unified Deep Learning Framework for Structural Mixed Effects Modeling on Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TabMixNN, a flexible PyTorch-based deep learning framework that synthesizes classical mixed-effects modeling with modern neural network architectures for tabular data analysis. TabMixNN addresses the growing need for methods that can handle hierarchical data structures while supporting diverse outcome types including regression, classification, and multitask learning. The framework implements a modular three-stage architecture: (1) a mixed-effects encoder with variational random effects and flexible covariance structures, (2) backbone architectures including Generalized Structural Equation Models (GSEM) and spatial-temporal manifold networks, and (3) outcome-specific prediction heads supporting multiple outcome families. Key innovations include an R-style formula interface for accessibility, support for directed acyclic graph (DAG) constraints for causal structure learning, Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) kernels for spatial modeling, and comprehensive interpretability tools including SHAP values and variance decomposition. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility through applications to longitudinal data analysis, genomic prediction, and spatial-temporal modeling. TabMixNN provides a unified interface for researchers to leverage deep learning while maintaining the interpretability and theoretical grounding of classical mixed-effects models.</description>

      <title>Zero-Trust Agentic Federated Learning for Secure IIoT Defense Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent attacks on critical infrastructure, including the 2021 Oldsmar water treatment breach and 2023 Danish energy sector compromises, highlight urgent security gaps in Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. While Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative intrusion detection, existing frameworks remain vulnerable to Byzantine poisoning attacks and lack robust agent authentication. We propose Zero-Trust Agentic Federated Learning (ZTA-FL), a defense in depth framework combining: (1) TPM-based cryptographic attestation achieving less than 0.0000001 false acceptance rate, (2) a novel SHAP-weighted aggregation algorithm providing explainable Byzantine detection under non-IID conditions with theoretical guarantees, and (3) privacy-preserving on-device adversarial training. Comprehensive experiments across three IDS benchmarks (Edge-IIoTset, CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15) demonstrate that ZTA-FL achieves 97.8 percent detection accuracy, 93.2 percent accuracy under 30 percent Byzantine attacks (outperforming FLAME by 3.1 percent, p less than 0.01), and 89.3 percent adversarial robustness while reducing communication overhead by 34 percent. We provide theoretical analysis, failure mode characterization, and release code for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds for Private and Robust Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the private and robust alignment of language models from a theoretical perspective by establishing upper bounds on the suboptimality gap in both offline and online settings. We consider preference labels subject to privacy constraints and/or adversarial corruption, and analyze two distinct interplays between them: privacy-first and corruption-first. For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime. In addition, we also present the first set of results for private and robust online alignment. Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence guarantees for log loss and square loss under privacy and corruption, which we believe have broad applicability across learning theory and statistics.</description>

      <title>MS-SSM: A Multi-Scale State Space Model for Efficient Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently attention as an efficient alternative to computationally expensive attention-based models for sequence modeling. They rely on linear recurrences to integrate information over time, enabling fast inference, parallelizable training, and control over recurrence stability. However, traditional SSMs often suffer from limited effective memory, requiring larger state sizes for improved recall. Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling. We further introduce an input-dependent scale-mixer, enabling dynamic information fusion across resolutions. The proposed approach significantly improves sequence modeling, particularly in long-range and hierarchical tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including Long Range Arena, hierarchical reasoning, time series classification, and image recognition, demonstrate that MS-SSM consistently outperforms prior SSM-based models, highlighting the benefits of multi-resolution processing in state-space architectures.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Prior of Generative Time Series Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series imputation, i.e., filling the missing values of a time recording, finds various applications in electricity, finance, and weather modelling. Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather show that Bridge-TS reaches a new record of imputation accuracy in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, demonstrating the superiority of improving prior for generative time series imputation.</description>

      <title>Trellis: Learning to Compress Key-Value Memory in Attention Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers, while powerful, suffer from quadratic computational complexity and the ever-growing Key-Value (KV) cache of the attention mechanism. This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time. Extensive experiments on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series show that the proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines. Notably, its performance gains increase as the sequence length grows, highlighting its potential for long-context applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural processes (NPs) are a class of models that learn stochastic processes directly from data and can be used for inference, sampling and conditional sampling. We introduce a new NP model based on flow matching, a generative modeling paradigm that has demonstrated strong performance on various data modalities. Following the NP training framework, the model provides amortized predictions of conditional distributions over any arbitrary points in the data. Compared to previous NP models, our model is simple to implement and can be used to sample from conditional distributions using an ODE solver, without requiring auxiliary conditioning methods. In addition, the model provides a controllable tradeoff between accuracy and running time via the number of steps in the ODE solver. We show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural process methods on various benchmarks including synthetic 1D Gaussian processes data, 2D images, and real-world weather data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding improves LLM inference by generating and verifying multiple tokens in parallel, but existing systems suffer from suboptimal performance due to a mismatch between dynamic speculation and static runtime assumptions. We present Yggdrasil, a co-designed system that enables latency-optimal speculative decoding through context-aware tree drafting and compiler-friendly execution. Yggdrasil introduces an equal-growth tree structure for static graph compatibility, a latency-aware optimization objective for draft selection, and stage-based scheduling to reduce overhead. Yggdrasil supports unmodified LLMs and achieves up to $3.98\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple hardware setups.</description>

      <title>Probing the Limits of Compressive Memory: A Study of Infini-Attention in Small-Scale Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates small-scale pretraining for Small Language Models (SLMs) to enable efficient use of limited data and compute, improve accessibility in low-resource settings and reduce costs. To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline. Our findings suggest that achieving robust long-context capability in SLMs benefits from architectural memory like Infini-attention.</description>

      <title>Max-Entropy Reinforcement Learning with Flow Matching and A Case Study on LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft actor-critic (SAC) is a popular algorithm for max-entropy reinforcement learning. In practice, the energy-based policies in SAC are often approximated using simple policy classes for efficiency, sacrificing the expressiveness and robustness. In this paper, we propose a variant of the SAC algorithm that parameterizes the policy with flow-based models, leveraging their rich expressiveness. In the algorithm, we evaluate the flow-based policy utilizing the instantaneous change-of-variable technique and update the policy with an online variant of flow matching developed in this paper. This online variant, termed importance sampling flow matching (ISFM), enables policy update with only samples from a user-specified sampling distribution rather than the unknown target distribution. We develop a theoretical analysis of ISFM, characterizing how different choices of sampling distributions affect the learning efficiency. Finally, we conduct a case study of our algorithm on the max-entropy linear quadratic regulator problems, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm learns the optimal action distribution.</description>

      <title>Efficient Deep Learning for Short-Term Solar Irradiance Time Series Forecasting: A Benchmark Study in Ho Chi Minh City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable forecasting of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is essential for mitigating the variability of solar energy in power grids. This study presents a comprehensive benchmark of ten deep learning architectures for short-term (1-hour ahead) GHI time series forecasting in Ho Chi Minh City, leveraging high-resolution NSRDB satellite data (2011-2020) to compare established baselines (e.g. LSTM, TCN) against emerging state-of-the-art architectures, including Transformer, Informer, iTransformer, TSMixer, and Mamba. Experimental results identify the Transformer as the superior architecture, achieving the highest predictive accuracy with an R^2 of 0.9696. The study further utilizes SHAP analysis to contrast the temporal reasoning of these architectures, revealing that Transformers exhibit a strong "recency bias" focused on immediate atmospheric conditions, whereas Mamba explicitly leverages 24-hour periodic dependencies to inform predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Knowledge Distillation can compress the high-performance Transformer by 23.5% while surprisingly reducing error (MAE: 23.78 W/m^2), offering a proven pathway for deploying sophisticated, low-latency forecasting on resource-constrained edge devices.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Dense Linear Transformations: Stagewise Pairwise Mixing (SPM) for Near-Linear Training in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense linear layers are a dominant source of computational and parametric cost in modern machine learning models, despite their quadratic complexity and often being misaligned with the compositional structure of learned representations. We introduce Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured linear operator that replaces dense matrices with a composition of sparse pairwise-mixing stages. An SPM layer implements a global linear transformation in $O(nL)$ time with $O(nL)$ parameters, where $L$ is typically constant or $log_2n$, and admits exact closed-form forward and backward computations. SPM is designed as a drop-in replacement for dense linear layers in feedforward networks, recurrent architectures, attention mechanisms, etc. We derive complete forward and backward expressions for two parameterizations: an orthogonal norm-preserving rotation-based variant and a fully general $2 \times 2$ mixing variant. Beyond computational savings, the stagewise structure of SPM induces an explicit compositional inductive bias that constrains model capacity and improves generalization when aligned with task structure. We present proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating substantial reductions in wall-clock cost and improved accuracy on structured learning problems, while retaining competitive performance on real-world benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Constraint Breeds Generalization: Temporal Dynamics as an Inductive Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional deep learning prioritizes unconstrained optimization, yet biological systems operate under strict metabolic constraints. We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical "transition" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization.</description>

      <title>Interactive Machine Learning: From Theory to Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, yet many of its most effective methods rely on access to large amounts of labeled data or extensive online interaction. In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making. Overall, this dissertation advances the theoretical foundations of interactive learning by developing algorithms that are statistically optimal and computationally efficient, while also providing principled guidance for deploying interactive learning methods in large-scale, real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Improved Balanced Classification with Theoretically Grounded Loss Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balanced loss is a widely adopted objective for multi-class classification under class imbalance. By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\mathsf p_{\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\sqrt{\mathsf p_{\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.</description>

      <title>DivQAT: Enhancing Robustness of Quantized Convolutional Neural Networks against Model Extraction Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their quantized counterparts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, posing a significant threat of IP theft. Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, combining our quantization technique with other defense mechanisms improves their effectiveness compared to traditional QAT.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Graph Neural Networks for Operational Flood Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flood models inform strategic disaster management by simulating the spatiotemporal hydrodynamics of flooding. While physics-based numerical flood models are accurate, their substantial computational cost limits their use in operational settings where rapid predictions are essential. Models designed with graph neural networks (GNNs) provide both speed and accuracy while having the ability to process unstructured spatial domains. Given its flexible input and architecture, GNNs can be leveraged alongside physics-informed techniques with ease, significantly improving interpretability. This study introduces a novel flood GNN architecture, DUALFloodGNN, which embeds physical constraints at both global and local scales through explicit loss terms. The model jointly predicts water volume at nodes and flow along edges through a shared message-passing framework. To improve performance for autoregressive inference, model training is conducted with a multi-step loss enhanced with dynamic curriculum learning. Compared with standard GNN architectures and state-of-the-art GNN flood models, DUALFloodGNN achieves substantial improvements in predicting multiple hydrologic variables while maintaining high computational efficiency. The model is open-sourced at https://github.com/acostacos/dual_flood_gnn.</description>

      <title>Causify DataFlow: A Framework For High-performance Machine Learning Stream Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DataFlow, a computational framework for building, testing, and deploying high-performance machine learning systems on unbounded time-series data. Traditional data science workflows assume finite datasets and require substantial reimplementation when moving from batch prototypes to streaming production systems. This gap introduces causality violations, batch boundary artifacts, and poor reproducibility of real-time failures.
  DataFlow resolves these issues through a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency: outputs at any time t depend only on a fixed-length context window preceding t. This guarantee ensures that models developed in batch mode execute identically in streaming production without code changes. The framework enforces strict causality by automatically tracking knowledge time across all transformations, eliminating future-peeking bugs.
  DataFlow supports flexible tiling across temporal and feature dimensions, allowing the same model to operate at different frequencies and memory profiles via configuration alone. It integrates natively with the Python data science stack and provides fit/predict semantics for online learning, caching and incremental computation, and automatic parallelization through DAG-based scheduling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across domains including financial trading, IoT, fraud detection, and real-time analytics.</description>

      <title>Assured Autonomy: How Operations Research Powers and Orchestrates Generative AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is shifting from conversational assistants toward agentic systems -- autonomous decision-making systems that sense, decide, and act within operational workflows. This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Quality Metric of Low-Dimensional Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the quality of low-dimensional embeddings from an explicitly information-theoretic perspective. We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Heart's Pathways: ECG Representation Learning from a Cardiac Conduction Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) stands as a cornerstone of cardiac diagnosis. Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines.</description>

      <title>Hyperspherical Graph Representation Learning via Adaptive Neighbor-Mean Alignment and Uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) aims to encode structural and semantic dependencies of graph-structured data into low-dimensional embeddings. However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of geometrically grounded, sampling-free contrastive objectives for graph representation learning.</description>

      <title>How and Why LLMs Generalize: A Fine-Grained Analysis of LLM Reasoning from Cognitive Behaviors to Low-Level Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display strikingly different generalization behaviors: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often narrows capability, whereas reinforcement-learning (RL) tuning tends to preserve it. The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns. This work provides new insights into the nature of reasoning in LLMs and points toward principles for designing training strategies that foster broad, robust generalization.</description>

      <title>Time-varying Mixing Matrix Design for Energy-efficient Decentralized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the design of mixing matrices to minimize the operation cost for decentralized federated learning (DFL) in wireless networks, with focus on minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption. As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scenario Highway Lane-Change Intention Prediction: A Temporal Physics-Informed Multi-Modal Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane-change intention prediction is safety-critical for autonomous driving and ADAS, but remains difficult in naturalistic traffic due to noisy kinematics, severe class imbalance, and limited generalization across heterogeneous highway scenarios. We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s. TPI-AI outperforms standalone LightGBM and Bi-LSTM baselines, achieving macro-F1 of 0.9562, 0.9124, 0.8345 on highD and 0.9247, 0.8197, 0.7605 on exiD at T = 1, 2, 3 s, respectively. These results show that combining physics-informed interaction features with learned temporal embeddings yields robust multi-scenario lane-change intention prediction.</description>

      <title>Autoregressivity in the Latent Space of a GP-VAE Language Model: An Empirical Ablation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an ablation-based analysis of latent autoregression in GP-VAE models, building upon our previous work introducing the architecture. Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior. These findings highlight the role of latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure, while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling. They should be interpreted as an empirical analysis of representational structure rather than as a proposal for a new architecture.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM Planning Capabilities through Intrinsic Self-Critique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an approach for LLMs to critique their \emph{own} answers with the goal of enhancing their performance that leads to significant improvements over established planning benchmarks. Despite the findings of earlier research that has cast doubt on the effectiveness of LLMs leveraging self critique methods, we show significant performance gains on planning datasets in the Blocksworld domain through intrinsic self-critique, without external source such as a verifier. We also demonstrate similar improvements on Logistics and Mini-grid datasets, exceeding strong baseline accuracies. We employ a few-shot learning technique and progressively extend it to a many-shot approach as our base method and demonstrate that it is possible to gain substantial improvement on top of this already competitive approach by employing an iterative process for correction and refinement. We illustrate how self-critique can significantly boost planning performance. Our empirical results present new state-of-the-art on the class of models considered, namely LLM model checkpoints from October 2024. Our primary focus lies on the method itself, demonstrating intrinsic self-improvement capabilities that are applicable regardless of the specific model version, and we believe that applying our method to more complex search techniques and more capable models will lead to even better performance.</description>

      <title>OptRot: Mitigating Weight Outliers via Data-Free Rotations for Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) weights and activations makes them difficult to quantize. Recent work has leveraged rotations to mitigate these outliers. In this work, we propose methods that learn fusible rotations by minimizing principled and cheap proxy objectives to the weight quantization error. We primarily focus on GPTQ as the quantization method. Our main method is OptRot, which reduces weight outliers simply by minimizing the element-wise fourth power of the rotated weights. We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance. In the W4A4 setting, we see that both OptRot and OptRot$^{+}$ perform worse, highlighting a trade-off between weight and activation quantization.</description>

      <title>GARDO: Reinforcing Diffusion Models without Reward Hacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>Colorful Pinball: Density-Weighted Quantile Regression for Conditional Guarantee of Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While conformal prediction provides robust marginal coverage guarantees, achieving reliable conditional coverage for specific inputs remains challenging. Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \(1-\alpha \pm \delta\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss. We provide a theoretical analysis with exact non-asymptotic guarantees characterizing the resulting excess risk. Extensive experiments on diverse high-dimensional real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable improvements in conditional coverage performance.</description>

      <title>Paired Seed Evaluation: Statistical Reliability for Learning-Based Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning systems appear stochastic but are deterministically random, as seeded pseudorandom number generators produce identical realisations across executions. Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not.</description>

      <title>Micro-Macro Tensor Neural Surrogates for Uncertainty Quantification in Collisional Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma kinetic equations exhibit pronounced sensitivity to microscopic perturbations in model parameters and data, making reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) essential for predictive simulations. However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension.</description>

      <title>Early Prediction of Sepsis using Heart Rate Signals and Genetic Optimized LSTM Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, results in significant mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs. The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring. The models were initially tailored for a prediction window of one hour, later extended to four hours through transfer learning. The encouraging outcomes of this study suggest the potential for wearable technology to facilitate early sepsis detection outside ICU and ward environments.</description>

      <title>Empower Low-Altitude Economy: A Reliability-Aware Dynamic Weighting Allocation for Multi-modal UAV Beam Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly expanding driven by urban air mobility, logistics drones, and aerial sensing, while fast and accurate beam prediction in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications is crucial for achieving reliable connectivity. Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the "multi-source representation beam semantics" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Tubular Riemannian Laplace Approximations for Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laplace approximations are among the simplest and most practical methods for approximate Bayesian inference in neural networks, yet their Euclidean formulation struggles with the highly anisotropic, curved loss surfaces and large symmetry groups that characterize modern deep models. Recent work has proposed Riemannian and geometric Gaussian approximations to adapt to this structure. Building on these ideas, we introduce the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation. TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost. TRL effectively bridges the gap between single-model efficiency and ensemble-grade reliability.</description>

      <title>Lifting Vision: Ground to Aerial Localization with Reasoning Guided Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal intelligence development recently show strong progress in visual understanding and high level reasoning. Though, most reasoning system still reply on textual information as the main medium for inference. This limit their effectiveness in spatial tasks such as visual navigation and geo-localization. This work discuss about the potential scope of this field and eventually propose an idea visual reasoning paradigm Geo-Consistent Visual Planning, our introduced framework called Visual Reasoning for Localization, or ViReLoc, which performs planning and localization using only visual representations. The proposed framework learns spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text based reasoning often suffer to understand. By encoding step by step inference in the visual domain and optimizing with reinforcement based objectives, ViReLoc plans routes between two given ground images. The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences. Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross view retrieval performance. These results establish visual reasoning as a strong complementary approach for navigation and localization, and show that such tasks can be performed without real time global positioning system data, leading to more secure navigation solutions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inference for Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Dynamic Discrete Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models explain sequential decision-making by recovering reward functions that rationalize observed behavior. Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency. Our framework extends classical inference for DDC models to nonparametric rewards and modern machine-learning tools, providing a unified and computationally tractable approach to statistical inference in IRL.</description>

      <title>Sparse classification with positive-confidence data in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional learning problems, where the number of features exceeds the sample size, often require sparse regularization for effective prediction and variable selection. While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches, effectively bridging the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learning Guided by Bias-Noise-Alignment Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Generative forecasting with joint probability models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit strong sensitivity to initial conditions and often contain unresolved multiscale processes, making deterministic forecasting fundamentally limited. Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.</description>

      <title>HOLOGRAPH: Active Causal Discovery via Sheaf-Theoretic Alignment of Large Language Model Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data remains fundamentally limited by identifiability constraints. Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (&lt;10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of "fair" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Generalising E-prop to Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent networks are typically trained with backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.</description>

      <title>More Than Bits: Multi-Envelope Double Binary Factorization for Extreme Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For extreme low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs), Double Binary Factorization (DBF) is attractive as it enables efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy. However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.</description>

      <title>From Perception to Punchline: Empowering VLM with the Art of In-the-wild Meme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating humorous memes is a challenging multimodal task that moves beyond direct image-to-caption supervision. It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group.</description>

      <title>CPR: Causal Physiological Representation Learning for Robust ECG Analysis under Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Large Concept Models: Latent Reasoning in an Adaptive Semantic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) apply uniform computation to all tokens, despite language exhibiting highly non-uniform information density. This token-uniform regime wastes capacity on locally predictable spans while under-allocating computation to semantically critical transitions. We propose $\textbf{Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM)}$, a hierarchical language modeling framework that learns semantic boundaries from latent representations and shifts computation from tokens to a compressed concept space where reasoning is more efficient. DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior. We introduce the first $\textbf{compression-aware scaling law}$, which disentangles token-level capacity, concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, enabling principled compute allocation under fixed FLOPs. To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\textbf{decoupled $\mu$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\textbf{+2.69$\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.</description>

      <title>AutoFed: Manual-Free Federated Traffic Prediction via Personalized Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

      <title>A Scalable Framework for logP Prediction: From Terabyte-Scale Data Integration to Interpretable Ensemble Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a large-scale predictive modeling framework for logP prediction using 426850 bioactive compounds rigorously curated from the intersection of three authoritative chemical databases: PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules. We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>HeteroHBA: A Generative Structure-Manipulating Backdoor Attack on Heterogeneous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved strong performance in many real-world applications, yet targeted backdoor poisoning on heterogeneous graphs remains less studied. We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.</description>

      <title>Mobility-Assisted Decentralized Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training among users without relying on a central server. However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.</description>

      <title>Nested Learning: The Illusion of Deep Learning Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery with Mixed Latent Confounding via Precision Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study causal discovery from observational data in linear Gaussian systems affected by \emph{mixed latent confounding}, where some unobserved factors act broadly across many variables while others influence only small subsets. This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure.
  We propose \textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.
  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.</description>

      <title>BandiK: Efficient Multi-Task Decomposition Using a Multi-Bandit Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.
  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language processing tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>From Trial to Deployment: A SEM Analysis of Traveler Adoptions to Fully Operational Autonomous Taxis</title>

Abstract: Autonomous taxi services represent a transformative advancement in urban mobility, offering safety, efficiency, and round-the-clock operations. While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \&amp; Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent as Implicit EM in Distance-Based Neural Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks trained with standard objectives exhibit behaviors characteristic of probabilistic inference: soft clustering, prototype specialization, and Bayesian uncertainty tracking. These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\partial L / \partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Neural Architecture Search for Multimodal Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the architectural design process of deep neural networks (DNN), has attracted increasing attention. Multimodal DNNs that necessitate feature fusion from multiple modalities benefit from NAS due to their structural complexity; however, constructing an architecture for multimodal DNNs through NAS requires a substantial amount of labeled training data. Thus, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for architecture search of multimodal DNNs. The proposed method applies SSL comprehensively for both the architecture search and model pretraining processes. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method successfully designed architectures for DNNs from unlabeled training data.</description>

      <title>DTI-GP: Bayesian operations for drug-target interactions using deep kernel Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise probabilistic information about drug-target interaction (DTI) predictions is vital for understanding limitations and boosting predictive performance. Gaussian processes (GP) offer a scalable framework to integrate state-of-the-art DTI representations and Bayesian inference, enabling novel operations, such as Bayesian classification with rejection, top-$K$ selection, and ranking. We propose a deep kernel learning-based GP architecture (DTI-GP), which incorporates a combined neural embedding module for chemical compounds and protein targets, and a GP module. The workflow continues with sampling from the predictive distribution to estimate a Bayesian precedence matrix, which is used in fast and accurate selection and ranking operations. DTI-GP outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, and it allows (1) the construction of a Bayesian accuracy-confidence enrichment score, (2) rejection schemes for improved enrichment, and (3) estimation and search for top-$K$ selections and ranking with high expected utility.</description>

      <title>Unregularized Linear Convergence in Zero-Sum Game from Preference Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results. Experiments corroborate the theoretical strengths of $\mathtt{OMWU}$ in both tabular and neural policy classes, demonstrating its potential for LLM applications.</description>

      <title>Discovering Coordinated Joint Options via Inter-Agent Relative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.</description>

      <title>AODDiff: Probabilistic Reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth via Diffusion-based Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) fields is critical for Atmosphere monitoring, yet current models remain constrained by the scarcity of complete training data and a lack of uncertainty quantification.To address these limitations, we propose AODDiff, a probabilistic reconstruction framework based on diffusion-based Bayesian inference. By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Transfer Using Multi-task Learning Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer effects manifest themselves both during training using a fixed data set and in inductive inference using accumulating data. We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models.</description>

      <title>PRISM: A hierarchical multiscale approach for time series forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting is critical in areas such as finance, biology, and healthcare. Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

      <title>Spectral Graph Neural Networks for Cognitive Task Classification in fMRI Connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive task classification using machine learning plays a central role in decoding brain states from neuroimaging data. By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25\%. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/gnnplayground/SpectralBrainGNN to support reproducibility and future research.</description>

      <title>Frequent subgraph-based persistent homology for graph classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MSACL: Multi-Step Actor-Critic Learning with Lyapunov Certificates for Exponentially Stabilizing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $\lambda$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control. Source code and benchmark environments will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Semi-overlapping Multi-bandit Best Arm Identification for Sequential Support Network Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern AI and ML problems require evaluating partners' contributions through shared yet asymmetric, computationally intensive processes and the simultaneous selection of the most beneficial candidates. Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.
  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.
  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).</description>

      <title>Attribution-Guided Distillation of Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle model activations into monosemantic, human-interpretable features. In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels</description>

      <title>Efficiently Estimating Data Efficiency for Language Model Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task. Our experiment results and implementation code are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Language Models are Provably Optimal Parallel Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models for faster inference via parallel token generation. We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.</description>

      <title>ResponseRank: Data-Efficient Reward Modeling through Preference Strength Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.</description>

      <title>Generative Classifiers Avoid Shortcut Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.</description>

      <title>On the geometry and topology of representations: the manifolds of modular addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Clock and Pizza interpretations, associated with architectures differing in either uniform or learnable attention, were introduced to argue that different architectural designs can yield distinct circuits for modular addition. In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and geometrically equivalent representations. Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms.</description>

      <title>Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.
  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.</description>

      <title>Scaling Open-Ended Reasoning to Predict the Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-stakes decision making involves reasoning under uncertainty about the future. In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is beginning to ease long-standing bottlenecks in the CAD-to-mesh pipeline. This survey reviews recent advances where machine learning aids part classification, mesh quality prediction, and defeaturing. We explore methods that improve unstructured and block-structured meshing, support volumetric parameterizations, and accelerate parallel mesh generation. We also examine emerging tools for scripting automation, including reinforcement learning and large language models. Across these efforts, AI acts as an assistive technology, extending the capabilities of traditional geometry and meshing tools. The survey highlights representative methods, practical deployments, and key research challenges that will shape the next generation of data-driven meshing workflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for understanding brain function, while neural activity in the brain is inherently spike-based. This paper bridges these two perspectives by designing spiking neural networks that simulate Bayesian inference through message passing for Bernoulli messages. To train the networks, we employ spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a biologically plausible mechanism for synaptic plasticity which is based on the Hebbian rule. Our results demonstrate that the network's performance closely matches the true numerical solution. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by implementing a factor graph example from coding theory, illustrating signal transmission over an unreliable channel.</description>

      <title>Governing Cloud Data Pipelines with Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud data pipelines increasingly operate under dynamic workloads, evolving schemas, cost constraints, and strict governance requirements. Despite advances in cloud-native orchestration frameworks, most production pipelines rely on static configurations and reactive operational practices, resulting in prolonged recovery times, inefficient resource utilization, and high manual overhead. This paper presents Agentic Cloud Data Engineering, a policy-aware control architecture that integrates bounded AI agents into the governance and control plane of cloud data pipelines. In Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform, specialized agents analyze pipeline telemetry and metadata, reason over declarative cost and compliance policies, and propose constrained operational actions such as adaptive resource reconfiguration, schema reconciliation, and automated failure recovery. All agent actions are validated against governance policies to ensure predictable and auditable behavior. We evaluate Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform using representative batch and streaming analytics workloads constructed from public enterprise-style datasets. Experimental results show that Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform reduces mean pipeline recovery time by up to 45%, lowers operational cost by approximately 25%, and decreases manual intervention events by over 70% compared to static orchestration, while maintaining data freshness and policy compliance. These results demonstrate that policy-bounded agentic control provides an effective and practical approach for governing cloud data pipelines in enterprise environments.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Discrimination Clusters: Quantifying and Explaining Systematic Fairness Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness in algorithmic decision-making is often framed in terms of individual fairness, which requires that similar individuals receive similar outcomes. A system violates individual fairness if there exists a pair of inputs differing only in protected attributes (such as race or gender) that lead to significantly different outcomes-for example, one favorable and the other unfavorable. While this notion highlights isolated instances of unfairness, it fails to capture broader patterns of systematic or clustered discrimination that may affect entire subgroups. We introduce and motivate the concept of discrimination clustering, a generalization of individual fairness violations. Rather than detecting single counterfactual disparities, we seek to uncover regions of the input space where small perturbations in protected features lead to k-significantly distinct clusters of outcomes. That is, for a given input, we identify a local neighborhood-differing only in protected attributes-whose members' outputs separate into many distinct clusters. These clusters reveal significant arbitrariness in treatment solely based on protected attributes that help expose patterns of algorithmic bias that elude pairwise fairness checks. We present HyFair, a hybrid technique that combines formal symbolic analysis (via SMT and MILP solvers) to certify individual fairness with randomized search to discover discriminatory clusters. This combination enables both formal guarantees-when no counterexamples exist-and the detection of severe violations that are computationally challenging for symbolic methods alone. Given a set of inputs exhibiting high k-unfairness, we introduce a novel explanation method to generate interpretable, decision-tree-style artifacts. Our experiments demonstrate that HyFair outperforms state-of-the-art fairness verification and local explanation methods.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Induced Over-Generation as Denial-of-Service: A Black-Box Attack-Side Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be driven into over-generation, emitting thousands of tokens before producing an end-of-sequence (EOS) token. This degrades answer quality, inflates latency and cost, and can be weaponized as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Recent work has begun to study DoS-style prompt attacks, but typically focuses on a single attack algorithm or assumes white-box access, without an attack-side benchmark that compares prompt-based attackers in a black-box, query-only regime with a known tokenizer. We introduce such a benchmark and study two prompt-only attackers. The first is Evolutionary Over-Generation Prompt Search (EOGen), which searches the token space for prefixes that suppress EOS and induce long continuations. The second is a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning attacker (RL-GOAL) that trains a network to generate prefixes conditioned on a target length. To characterize behavior, we introduce Over-Generation Factor (OGF), the ratio of produced tokens to a model's context window, along with stall and latency summaries. Our evolutionary attacker achieves mean OGF = 1.38 +/- 1.15 and Success@OGF &gt;= 2 of 24.5 percent on Phi-3. RL-GOAL is stronger: across victims it achieves higher mean OGF (up to 2.81 +/- 1.38).</description>

      <title>Fitted Q Evaluation Without Bellman Completeness via Stationary Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fitted Q-evaluation (FQE) is a central method for off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, but it generally requires Bellman completeness: that the hypothesis class is closed under the evaluation Bellman operator. This requirement is challenging because enlarging the hypothesis class can worsen completeness. We show that the need for this assumption stems from a fundamental norm mismatch: the Bellman operator is gamma-contractive under the stationary distribution of the target policy, whereas FQE minimizes Bellman error under the behavior distribution. We propose a simple fix: reweight each regression step using an estimate of the stationary density ratio, thereby aligning FQE with the norm in which the Bellman operator contracts. This enables strong evaluation guarantees in the absence of realizability or Bellman completeness, avoiding the geometric error blow-up of standard FQE in this setting while maintaining the practicality of regression-based evaluation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Mitigation with Attention Graph Transformers for Burgers Equation Solvers on NISQ Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.</description>

Abstract: Denoising and score estimation have long been known to be linked via the classical Tweedie's formula. In this work, we first extend the latter to a wider range of distributions often called "energy models" and denoted elliptical distributions in this work. Next, we examine an alternative view: we consider the denoising posterior $P(X|Y)$ as the optimizer of the energy score (a scoring rule) and derive a fundamental identity that connects the (path-) derivative of a (possibly) non-Euclidean energy score to the score of the noisy marginal. This identity can be seen as an analog of Tweedie's identity for the energy score, and allows for several interesting applications; for example, score estimation, noise distribution parameter estimation, as well as using energy score models in the context of "traditional" diffusion model samplers with a wider array of noising distributions.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for inverse problems using connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are important mathematical problems that seek to recover model parameters from noisy data. Since inverse problems are often ill-posed, they require regularization or incorporation of prior information about the underlying model or unknown variables. Proximal operators, ubiquitous in nonsmooth optimization, are central to this because they provide a flexible and convenient way to encode priors and build efficient iterative algorithms. They have also recently become key to modern machine learning methods, e.g., for plug-and-play methods for learned denoisers and deep neural architectures for learning priors of proximal operators. The latter was developed partly due to recent work characterizing proximal operators of nonconvex priors as subdifferential of convex potentials. In this work, we propose to leverage connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) to develop novel deep learning architectures for learning the prior. In contrast to other existing methods, we learn the prior directly without recourse to inverting the prior after training. We present several numerical results that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Question Answering: When Should LLMs Admit Ignorance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Lens: Exploiting Attention Layers to Generate Adversarial Examples for Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.</description>

      <title>A Test of Lookahead Bias in LLM Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a statistical test to detect lookahead bias in economic forecasts generated by large language models (LLMs). Using state-of-the-art pre-training data detection techniques, we estimate the likelihood that a given prompt appeared in an LLM's training corpus, a statistic we term Lookahead Propensity (LAP). We formally show that a positive correlation between LAP and forecast accuracy indicates the presence and magnitude of lookahead bias, and apply the test to two forecasting tasks: news headlines predicting stock returns and earnings call transcripts predicting capital expenditures. Our test provides a cost-efficient, diagnostic tool for assessing the validity and reliability of LLM-generated forecasts.</description>

      <title>Integrating Domain Knowledge for Financial QA: A Multi-Retriever RAG Approach with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (&gt;7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.</description>

      <title>Security Without Detection: Economic Denial as a Primitive for Edge and IoT Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection-based security fails against sophisticated attackers using encryption, stealth, and low-rate techniques, particularly in IoT/edge environments where resource constraints preclude ML-based intrusion detection. We present Economic Denial Security (EDS), a detection-independent framework that makes attacks economically infeasible by exploiting a fundamental asymmetry: defenders control their environment while attackers cannot. EDS composes four mechanisms adaptive computational puzzles, decoy-driven interaction entropy, temporal stretching, and bandwidth taxation achieving provably superlinear cost amplification. We formalize EDS as a Stackelberg game, deriving closed-form equilibria for optimal parameter selection (Theorem 1) and proving that mechanism composition yields 2.1x greater costs than the sum of individual mechanisms (Theorem 2). EDS requires &lt; 12KB memory, enabling deployment on ESP32 class microcontrollers. Evaluation on a 20-device heterogeneous IoT testbed across four attack scenarios (n = 30 trials, p &lt; 0.001) demonstrates: 32-560x attack slowdown, 85-520:1 cost asymmetry, 8-62% attack success reduction, &lt; 20ms latency overhead, and close to 0% false positives. Validation against IoT-23 malware (Mirai, Torii, Hajime) shows 88% standalone mitigation; combined with ML-IDS, EDS achieves 94% mitigation versus 67% for IDS alone a 27% improvement. EDS provides detection-independent protection suitable for resource-constrained environments where traditional approaches fail. The ability to detect and mitigate the malware samples tested was enhanced; however, the benefits provided by EDS were realized even without the inclusion of an IDS. Overall, the implementation of EDS serves to shift the economic balance in favor of the defender and provides a viable method to protect IoT and edge systems methodologies.</description>

      <title>The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.</description>

      <title>Lifelong Domain Adaptive 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.</description>

      <title>A multimodal Transformer for InSAR-based ground deformation forecasting with cross-site generalization across Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-real-time regional-scale monitoring of ground deformation is increasingly required to support urban planning, critical infrastructure management, and natural hazard mitigation. While Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continental-scale services such as the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provide dense observations of past motion, predicting the next observation remains challenging due to the superposition of long-term trends, seasonal cycles, and occasional abrupt discontinuities (e.g., co-seismic steps), together with strong spatial heterogeneity. In this study we propose a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series (resampled to a 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles). The model ingests recent displacement snapshots together with (i) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from the training window only, and (ii) harmonic day-of-year encodings. On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the STGCN is strongest in the displacement-only setting, whereas the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and $R^2$ = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies.</description>

      <title>Tensor Computing Interface: An Application-Oriented, Lightweight Interface for Portable High-Performance Tensor Network Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) are a central computational tool in quantum science and artificial intelligence. However, the lack of unified software interface across tensor-computing frameworks severely limits the portability of TN applications, coupling algorithmic development to specific hardware and software back ends. To address this challenge, we introduce the Tensor Computing Interface (TCI) -- an application-oriented, lightweight application programming interface designed to enable framework-independent, high-performance TN applications. TCI provides a well-defined type system that abstracts tensor objects together with a minimal yet expressive set of core functions covering essential tensor manipulations and tensor linear-algebra operations. Through numerical demonstrations on representative tensor-network applications, we show that codes written against TCI can be migrated seamlessly across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms while achieving performance comparable to native framework implementations. We further release an open-source implementation of TCI based on \textit{Cytnx}, demonstrating its practicality and ease of integration with existing tensor-computing frameworks.</description>

      <title>Stationary Reweighting Yields Local Convergence of Soft Fitted Q-Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fitted Q-iteration (FQI) and its entropy-regularized variant, soft FQI, are central tools for value-based model-free offline reinforcement learning, but can behave poorly under function approximation and distribution shift. In the entropy-regularized setting, we show that the soft Bellman operator is locally contractive in the stationary norm of the soft-optimal policy, rather than in the behavior norm used by standard FQI. This geometric mismatch explains the instability of soft Q-iteration with function approximation in the absence of Bellman completeness. To restore contraction, we introduce stationary-reweighted soft FQI, which reweights each regression update using the stationary distribution of the current policy. We prove local linear convergence under function approximation with geometrically damped weight-estimation errors, assuming approximate realizability. Our analysis further suggests that global convergence may be recovered by gradually reducing the softmax temperature, and that this continuation approach can extend to the hardmax limit under a mild margin condition.</description>

      <title>Assessing generative modeling approaches for free energy estimates in condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate estimation of free energy differences between two states is a long-standing challenge in molecular simulations. Traditional approaches generally rely on sampling multiple intermediate states to ensure sufficient overlap in phase space and are, consequently, computationally expensive. Several generative-model-based methods have recently addressed this challenge by learning a direct bridge between distributions, bypassing the need for intermediate states. However, it remains unclear which approaches provide the best trade-off between efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. In this work, we systematically review these methods and benchmark selected approaches with a focus on condensed-matter systems. In particular, we investigate the performance of discrete and continuous normalizing flows in the context of targeted free energy perturbation as well as FEAT (Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport) together with the escorted Jarzynski equality, using coarse-grained monatomic ice and Lennard-Jones solids as benchmark systems. We evaluate accuracy, data efficiency, computational cost, and scalability with system size. Our results provide a quantitative framework for selecting effective free energy estimation strategies in condensed-phase systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical Guarantees in the Search for Less Discriminatory Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent scholarship has argued that firms building data-driven decision systems in high-stakes domains like employment, credit, and housing should search for "less discriminatory algorithms" (LDAs) (Black et al., 2024). That is, for a given decision problem, firms considering deploying a model should make a good-faith effort to find equally performant models with lower disparate impact across social groups. Evidence from the literature on model multiplicity shows that randomness in training pipelines can lead to multiple models with the same performance, but meaningful variations in disparate impact. This suggests that developers can find LDAs simply by randomly retraining models. Firms cannot continue retraining forever, though, which raises the question: What constitutes a good-faith effort? In this paper, we formalize LDA search via model multiplicity as an optimal stopping problem, where a model developer with limited information wants to produce strong evidence that they have sufficiently explored the space of models. Our primary contribution is an adaptive stopping algorithm that yields a high-probability upper bound on the gains achievable from a continued search, allowing the developer to certify (e.g., to a court) that their search was sufficient. We provide a framework under which developers can impose stronger assumptions about the distribution of models, yielding correspondingly stronger bounds. We validate the method on real-world credit, employment and housing datasets.</description>

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for continuous normalizing flows, yet standard FM implicitly performs an unweighted $L^2$ regression over the entire ambient space. In high dimensions, this leads to a fundamental inefficiency: the vast majority of the integration domain consists of low-density ``void'' regions where the target velocity fields are often chaotic or ill-defined. In this paper, we propose {$\gamma$-Flow Matching ($\gamma$-FM)}, a density-weighted variant that aligns the regression geometry with the underlying probability flow. While density weighting is desirable, naive implementations would require evaluating the intractable target density. We circumvent this by introducing a Dynamic Density-Weighting strategy that estimates the \emph{target} density directly from training particles. This approach allows us to dynamically downweight the regression loss in void regions without compromising the simulation-free nature of FM. Theoretically, we establish that $\gamma$-FM minimizes the transport cost on a statistical manifold endowed with the $\gamma$-Stein metric. Spectral analysis further suggests that this geometry induces an implicit Sobolev regularization, effectively damping high-frequency oscillations in void regions. Empirically, $\gamma$-FM significantly improves vector field smoothness and sampling efficiency on high-dimensional latent datasets, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to outliers.</description>

      <title>Improving Multi-step RAG with Hypergraph-based Memory for Long-Context Complex Relational Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Spiking Neural Networks in UWB Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although existing deep learning-based Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) channel estimation methods achieve high accuracy, their computational intensity clashes sharply with the resource constraints of low-cost edge devices. Motivated by this, this letter explores the potential of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for this task and develops a fully unsupervised SNN solution. To enable a comprehensive performance analysis, we devise an extensive set of comparative strategies and evaluate them on a compelling public benchmark. Experimental results show that our unsupervised approach still attains 80% test accuracy, on par with several supervised deep learning-based strategies. Moreover, compared with complex deep learning methods, our SNN implementation is inherently suited to neuromorphic deployment and offers a drastic reduction in model complexity, bringing significant advantages for future neuromorphic practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the task of generating samples from a tilted distribution of a random vector whose underlying distribution is unknown, but samples from it are available. This finds applications in fields such as finance and climate science, and in rare event simulation. In this article, we discuss the asymptotic efficiency of a self-normalized importance sampler of the tilted distribution. We provide a sharp characterization of its accuracy, given the number of samples and the degree of tilt. Our findings reveal a surprising dichotomy: while the number of samples needed to accurately tilt a bounded random vector increases polynomially in the tilt amount, it increases at a super polynomial rate for unbounded distributions.</description>

      <title>MeLeMaD: Adaptive Malware Detection via Chunk-wise Feature Selection and Meta-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confronting the substantial challenges of malware detection in cybersecurity necessitates solutions that are both robust and adaptable to the ever-evolving threat environment. The paper introduces Meta Learning Malware Detection (MeLeMaD), a novel framework leveraging the adaptability and generalization capabilities of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for malware detection. MeLeMaD incorporates a novel feature selection technique, Chunk-wise Feature Selection based on Gradient Boosting (CFSGB), tailored for handling large-scale, high-dimensional malware datasets, significantly enhancing the detection efficiency. Two benchmark malware datasets (CIC-AndMal2020 and BODMAS) and a custom dataset (EMBOD) were used for rigorously validating the MeLeMaD, achieving a remarkable performance in terms of key evaluation measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, MCC, and AUC. With accuracies of 98.04\% on CIC-AndMal2020 and 99.97\% on BODMAS, MeLeMaD outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The custom dataset, EMBOD, also achieves a commendable accuracy of 97.85\%. The results underscore the MeLeMaD's potential to address the challenges of robustness, adaptability, and large-scale, high-dimensional datasets in malware detection, paving the way for more effective and efficient cybersecurity solutions.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Reasoning Behaviors and Where to Find Them: Unsupervised Discovery of the Reasoning Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>RepetitionCurse: Measuring and Understanding Router Imbalance in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs under DoS Stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts architectures have become the standard for scaling large language models due to their superior parameter efficiency. To accommodate the growing number of experts in practice, modern inference systems commonly adopt expert parallelism to distribute experts across devices. However, the absence of explicit load balancing constraints during inference allows adversarial inputs to trigger severe routing concentration. We demonstrate that out-of-distribution prompts can manipulate the routing strategy such that all tokens are consistently routed to the same set of top-$k$ experts, which creates computational bottlenecks on certain devices while forcing others to idle. This converts an efficiency mechanism into a denial-of-service attack vector, leading to violations of service-level agreements for time to first token. We propose RepetitionCurse, a low-cost black-box strategy to exploit this vulnerability. By identifying a universal flaw in MoE router behavior, RepetitionCurse constructs adversarial prompts using simple repetitive token patterns in a model-agnostic manner. On widely deployed MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B, our method increases end-to-end inference latency by 3.063x, degrading service availability significantly.</description>

      <title>Policy Mirror Descent with Temporal Difference Learning: Sample Complexity under Online Markov Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the policy mirror descent (PMD) method, which is a general policy optimization framework in reinforcement learning and can cover a wide range of policy gradient methods by specifying difference mirror maps. Existing sample complexity analysis for policy mirror descent either focuses on the generative sampling model, or the Markovian sampling model but with the action values being explicitly approximated to certain pre-specified accuracy. In contrast, we consider the sample complexity of policy mirror descent with temporal difference (TD) learning under the Markovian sampling model. Two algorithms called Expected TD-PMD and Approximate TD-PMD have been presented, which are off-policy and mixed policy algorithms respectively. Under a small enough constant policy update step size, the $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (a logarithm factor about $\varepsilon$ is hidden in $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$) sample complexity can be established for them to achieve average-time $\varepsilon$-optimality. The sample complexity is further improved to $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (without the hidden logarithm factor) to achieve the last-iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality based on adaptive policy update step sizes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hallucinations: A Composite Score for Measuring Reliability in Open-Source Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma are increasingly used in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, law, and finance, yet their reliability remains uncertain. They often make overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates. Existing evaluations are fragmented, addressing only isolated aspects. We introduce the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified framework that integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single interpretable metric. Through experiments on ten leading open-source LLMs across five QA datasets, we assess performance under baselines, perturbations, and calibration methods. CRS delivers stable model rankings, uncovers hidden failure modes missed by single metrics, and highlights that the most dependable systems balance accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Random Multiplexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wireless communication applications evolve from traditional multipath environments to high-mobility scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles, multiplexing techniques have advanced accordingly. Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.</description>

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has primarily been driven by resource-rich research groups and industry partners. Due to the lack of on-premise computing resources required for increasingly complex models, many researchers are turning to cloud services like AWS SageMaker to train Hugging Face models. However, the steep learning curve of cloud platforms often presents a barrier for researchers accustomed to local environments. Existing documentation frequently leaves knowledge gaps, forcing users to seek fragmented information across the web. This demo paper aims to democratize cloud adoption by centralizing the essential information required for researchers to successfully train their first Hugging Face model on AWS SageMaker from scratch.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a class of stochastic interpolation neural network operators (SINNOs) with random coefficients activated by sigmoidal functions. We establish their boundedness, interpolation accuracy, and approximation capabilities in the mean square sense, in probability, as well as path-wise within the space of second-order stochastic (random) processes \( L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) \). Additionally, we provide quantitative error estimates using the modulus of continuity of the processes. These results highlight the effectiveness of SINNOs for approximating stochastic processes with potential applications in COVID-19 case prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) play a central role in describing experimental data at colliders and provide insight into the structure of nucleons. As the LHC enters an era of high-precision measurements, a robust PDF determination with a reliable uncertainty quantification has become mandatory in order to match the experimental precision. The NNPDF collaboration has pioneered the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for PDF determinations, using Neural Networks (NNs) to parametrise the unknown PDFs in a flexible and unbiased way. The NNs are then trained on experimental data by means of stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The statistical robustness of the results is validated by extensive closure tests using synthetic data. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyse the training dynamics of neural networks. This approach allows us to derive, under precise assumptions, an analytical description of the neural network evolution during training, enabling a quantitative understanding of the training process. Having an analytical handle on the training dynamics allows us to clarify the role of the NN architecture and the impact of the experimental data in a transparent way. Similarly, we are able to describe the evolution of the covariance of the NN output during training, providing a quantitative description of how uncertainties are propagated from the data to the fitted function. While our results are not a substitute for PDF fitting, they do provide a powerful diagnostic tool to assess the robustness of current fitting methodologies. Beyond its relevance for particle physics phenomenology, our analysis of PDF determinations provides a testbed to apply theoretical ideas about the learning process developed in the ML community.</description>

      <title>Score-based sampling without diffusions: Guidance from a simple and modular scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling based on score diffusions has led to striking empirical results, and has attracted considerable attention from various research communities. It depends on availability of (approximate) Stein score functions for various levels of additive noise. We describe and analyze a modular scheme that reduces score-based sampling to solving a short sequence of ``nice'' sampling problems, for which high-accuracy samplers are known. We show how to design forward trajectories such that both (a) the terminal distribution, and (b) each of the backward conditional distribution is defined by a strongly log concave (SLC) distribution. This modular reduction allows us to exploit \emph{any} SLC sampling algorithm in order to traverse the backwards path, and we establish novel guarantees with short proofs for both uni-modal and multi-modal densities. The use of high-accuracy routines yields $\varepsilon$-accurate answers, in either KL or Wasserstein distances, with polynomial dependence on $\log(1/\varepsilon)$ and $\sqrt{d}$ dependence on the dimension.</description>

      <title>Deep Global Clustering for Hyperspectral Image Segmentation: Concepts, Applications, and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

Abstract: Quantum brushes are computational arts software introduced by Ferreira et al (2025) that leverage quantum behavior to generate novel artistic effects. In this outreach paper, we introduce the mathematical framework and describe the implementation of two quantum brushes based on variational quantum algorithms, Steerable and Chemical. While Steerable uses quantum geometric control theory to merge two works of art, Chemical mimics variational eigensolvers for estimating molecular ground energies to evolve colors on an underlying canvas. The implementation of both brushes is available open-source at https://github.com/moth-quantum/QuantumBrush and is fully compatible with the original quantum brushes.</description>

      <title>Guiding a Diffusion Transformer with the Internal Dynamics of Itself</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.</description>

      <title>Medical Image Classification on Imbalanced Data Using ProGAN and SMA-Optimized ResNet: Application to COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.</description>

      <title>MotivNet: Evolving Meta-Sapiens into an Emotionally Intelligent Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Solving the Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) is a prominent variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), extensively studied in operations research and computational science. FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a novel policy network, termed FRIPN, that seamlessly integrates fleet composition and routing decisions. Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios. These strengths highlight the potential of our approach for practical applications and provide valuable inspiration for extending DRL-based techniques to other variants of VRP.</description>

      <title>Joint Selection for Large-Scale Pre-Training Data via Policy Gradient-based Mask Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.</description>

      <title>Fast reconstruction-based ROI triggering via anomaly detection in the CYGNO optical TPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical-readout Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) produce megapixel-scale images whose fine-grained topological information is essential for rare-event searches, but whose size challenges real-time data selection. We present an unsupervised, reconstruction-based anomaly-detection strategy for fast Region-of-Interest (ROI) extraction that operates directly on minimally processed camera frames. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images learns the detector noise morphology without labels, simulation, or fine-grained calibration. Applied to standard data-taking frames, localized reconstruction residuals identify particle-induced structures, from which compact ROIs are extracted via thresholding and spatial clustering. Using real data from the CYGNO optical TPC prototype, we compare two pedestal-trained autoencoder configurations that differ only in their training objective, enabling a controlled study of its impact. The best configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with an inference time of approximately 25 ms per frame on a consumer GPU. The results demonstrate that careful design of the training objective is critical for effective reconstruction-based anomaly detection and that pedestal-trained autoencoders provide a transparent and detector-agnostic baseline for online data reduction in optical TPCs.</description>

      <title>MaRCA: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Computation Allocation in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recommender systems face significant computational challenges due to growing model complexity and traffic scale, making efficient computation allocation critical for maximizing business revenue. Existing approaches typically simplify multi-stage computation resource allocation, neglecting inter-stage dependencies, thus limiting global optimality. In this paper, we propose MaRCA, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for end-to-end computation resource allocation in large-scale recommender systems. MaRCA models the stages of a recommender system as cooperative agents, using Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) to optimize revenue under computation resource constraints. We introduce an AutoBucket TestBench for accurate computation cost estimation, and a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Revenue-Cost Balancer to proactively forecast traffic loads and adjust the revenue-cost trade-off accordingly. Since its end-to-end deployment in the advertising pipeline of a leading global e-commerce platform in November 2024, MaRCA has consistently handled hundreds of billions of ad requests per day and has delivered a 16.67% revenue uplift using existing computation resources.</description>

      <title>Topological Spatial Graph Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial graphs are particular graphs for which the nodes are localized in space (e.g., public transport network, molecules, branching biological structures). In this work, we consider the problem of spatial graph reduction, that aims to find a smaller spatial graph (i.e., with less nodes) with the same overall structure as the initial one. In this context, performing the graph reduction while preserving the main topological features of the initial graph is particularly relevant, due to the additional spatial information. Thus, we propose a topological spatial graph coarsening approach based on a new framework that finds a trade-off between the graph reduction and the preservation of the topological characteristics. The coarsening is realized by collapsing short edges. In order to capture the topological information required to calibrate the reduction level, we adapt the construction of classical topological descriptors made for point clouds (the so-called persistent diagrams) to spatial graphs. This construction relies on the introduction of a new filtration called triangle-aware graph filtration. Our coarsening approach is parameter-free and we prove that it is equivariant under rotations, translations and scaling of the initial spatial graph. We evaluate the performances of our method on synthetic and real spatial graphs, and show that it significantly reduces the graph sizes while preserving the relevant topological information.</description>

      <title>OptiVote: Non-Coherent FSO Over-the-Air Majority Vote for Communication-Efficient Distributed Federated Learning in Space Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of mega-constellations is driving the long-term vision of space data centers (SDCs), where interconnected satellites form in-orbit distributed computing and learning infrastructures. Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Geotechnical Engineering: A Critical Assessment of PINNs and Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods -- physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), deep operator networks (DeepONet), and graph network simulators (GNS) -- are increasingly proposed for geotechnical problems. This paper tests these methods against traditional solvers on canonical problems: wave propagation and beam-foundation interaction. PINNs run 90,000 times slower than finite difference with larger errors. DeepONet requires thousands of training simulations and breaks even only after millions of evaluations. Multi-layer perceptrons fail catastrophically when extrapolating beyond training data -- the common case in geotechnical prediction. GNS shows promise for geometry-agnostic simulation but faces scaling limits and cannot capture path-dependent soil behavior. For inverse problems, automatic differentiation through traditional solvers recovers material parameters with sub-percent accuracy in seconds. We recommend: use automatic differentiation for inverse problems; apply site-based cross-validation to account for spatial autocorrelation; reserve neural networks for problems where traditional solvers are genuinely expensive and predictions remain within the training envelope. When a method is four orders of magnitude slower with less accuracy, it is not a viable replacement for proven solvers.</description>

      <title>Implicit score matching meets denoising score matching: improved rates of convergence and log-density Hessian estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the score function using both implicit score matching and denoising score matching. Assuming that the data distribution exhibiting a low-dimensional structure, we prove that implicit score matching is able not only to adapt to the intrinsic dimension, but also to achieve the same rates of convergence as denoising score matching in terms of the sample size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both methods allow us to estimate log-density Hessians without the curse of dimensionality by simple differentiation. This justifies convergence of ODE-based samplers for generative diffusion models. Our approach is based on Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type inequalities relating weighted $L^2$-norms of smooth functions and their derivatives.</description>

      <title>Virasoro Symmetry in Neural Network Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Network Field Theories (NN-FTs) can realize global conformal symmetries via embedding space architectures. These models describe Generalized Free Fields (GFFs) in the infinite width limit. However, they typically lack a local stress-energy tensor satisfying conformal Ward identities. This presents an obstruction to realizing infinite-dimensional, local conformal symmetry typifying 2d Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). We present the first construction of an NN-FT that encodes the full Virasoro symmetry of a 2d CFT. We formulate a neural free boson theory with a local stress tensor $T(z)$ by properly choosing the architecture and prior distribution of network parameters. We verify the analytical results through numerical simulation; computing the central charge and the scaling dimensions of vertex operators. We then construct an NN realization of a Majorana Fermion and an $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ scalar multiplet, which then enables an extension of the formalism to include super-Virasoro symmetry. Finally, we extend the framework by constructing boundary NN-FTs that preserve (super-)conformal symmetry via the method of images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large data-driven physics models like DeepMind's weather model GraphCast have empirically succeeded in parameterizing time operators for complex dynamical systems with an accuracy reaching or in some cases exceeding that of traditional physics-based solvers. Unfortunately, how these data-driven models perform computations is largely unknown and whether their internal representations are interpretable or physically consistent is an open question. Here, we adapt tools from interpretability research in Large Language Models to analyze intermediate computational layers in GraphCast, leveraging sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features in the neuron space of the model. We uncover distinct features on a wide range of length and time scales that correspond to tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, diurnal and seasonal behavior, large-scale precipitation patterns, specific geographical coding, and sea-ice extent, among others. We further demonstrate how the precise abstraction of these features can be probed via interventions on the prediction steps of the model. As a case study, we sparsely modify a feature corresponding to tropical cyclones in GraphCast and observe interpretable and physically consistent modifications to evolving hurricanes. Such methods offer a window into the black-box behavior of data-driven physics models and are a step towards realizing their potential as trustworthy predictors and scientifically valuable tools for discovery.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Semantic Communications via Multi-Task Learning and Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications conveys task-relevant meaning rather than focusing solely on message reconstruction, improving bandwidth efficiency and robustness for next-generation wireless systems. However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task. This comprehensive framework motivates semantic communication designs with tunable, end-to-end privacy against adaptive adversaries in realistic wireless settings.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Spatial Graph Learning for Multispectral Solar Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

      <title>What Drives Success in Physical Planning with Joint-Embedding Predictive World Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks. Code, data and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/jepa-wms.</description>

      <title>Improving the stability of the covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin thermostat for large-scale Bayesian sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and its variants approximate the likelihood of an entire dataset, via random (and typically much smaller) subsets, in the setting of Bayesian sampling. Due to the (often substantial) improvement of the computational efficiency, they have been widely used in large-scale machine learning applications. It has been demonstrated that the so-called covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (CCAdL) thermostat, which incorporates an additional term involving the covariance matrix of the noisy force, outperforms popular alternative methods. A moving average is used in CCAdL to estimate the covariance matrix of the noisy force, in which case the covariance matrix will converge to a constant matrix in long-time limit. Moreover, it appears in our numerical experiments that the use of a moving average could reduce the stability of the numerical integrators, thereby limiting the largest usable stepsize. In this article, we propose a modified CCAdL (i.e., mCCAdL) thermostat that uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential to numerically approximate the exact solution to the subsystem involving the additional term proposed in CCAdL. We also propose a symmetric splitting method for mCCAdL, instead of an Euler-type discretisation used in the original CCAdL thermostat. We demonstrate in our numerical experiments that the newly proposed mCCAdL thermostat achieves a substantial improvement in the numerical stability over the original CCAdL thermostat, while significantly outperforming popular alternative stochastic gradient methods in terms of the numerical accuracy for large-scale machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>A Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Task Learning for Missing PMU Data Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states efficiently represent many-body wavefunctions with neural networks, but the cost of Monte Carlo sampling limits their scaling to large system sizes. Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Steering the Cognitive Behaviors of Reasoning Models at Test-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian Dynamic Programming for On-policy Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) that incorporates robustness against transition uncertainty. We define two distinct yet coupled risk measures: an inner risk measure addressing state and cost randomness and an outer risk measure capturing transition dynamics uncertainty. Our framework unifies and generalizes most existing RL frameworks by permitting general coherent risk measures for both inner and outer risk measures. Within this framework, we construct a risk-sensitive robust Markov decision process (RSRMDP), derive its Bellman equation, and provide error analysis under a given posterior distribution. We further develop a Bayesian Dynamic Programming (Bayesian DP) algorithm that alternates between posterior updates and value iteration. The approach employs an estimator for the risk-based Bellman operator that combines Monte Carlo sampling with convex optimization, for which we prove strong consistency guarantees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges to a near-optimal policy in the training environment and analyze both the sample complexity and the computational complexity under the Dirichlet posterior and CVaR. Finally, we validate our approach through two numerical experiments. The results exhibit excellent convergence properties while providing intuitive demonstrations of its advantages in both risk-sensitivity and robustness. Empirically, we further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm through an application on option hedging.</description>

      <title>MultiRisk: Multiple Risk Control via Iterative Score Thresholding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As generative AI systems are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, regulating multiple dimensions of model behavior has become essential. We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constraints with user-defined priorities, and introduce two efficient dynamic programming algorithms that leverage this sequential structure. The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks. The analysis requires an intricate iterative argument, upper bounding the risks by introducing several forms of intermediate symmetrized risk functions, and carefully lower bounding the risks by recursively counting jumps in symmetrized risk functions between appropriate risk levels. We evaluate our framework on a three-constraint Large Language Model alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, where the goal is to maximize helpfulness subject to multiple safety constraints, and where scores are generated by a Large Language Model judge and a perplexity filter. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can control each individual risk at close to the target level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and the development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Acoustic Voice Biomarker-Based Hierarchical Classification of Benign Laryngeal Voice Disorders from Sustained Vowels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benign laryngeal voice disorders affect nearly one in five individuals and often manifest as dysphonia, while also serving as non-invasive indicators of broader physiological dysfunction. We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment. These results highlight the potential of quantitative voice biomarkers as scalable, non-invasive tools for early screening, diagnostic triage, and longitudinal monitoring of vocal health.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of classical numerical solvers, such as Petviashvili's method or finite difference with Newton iterations, and neural network-based methods for computing ground states or profiles of solitary-wave solutions to the one-dimensional dispersive PDEs that include the nonlinear Schr\"odinger, the nonlinear Klein-Gordon and the generalized KdV equations. We confirm that classical approaches retain high-order accuracy and strong computational efficiency for single-instance problems in the one-dimensional setting. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are also able to reproduce qualitative solutions but are generally less accurate and less efficient in low dimensions than classical solvers due to expensive training and slow convergence. We also investigate the operator-learning methods, which, although computationally intensive during training, can be reused across many parameter instances, providing rapid inference after pretraining, making them attractive for applications involving repeated simulations or real-time predictions. For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Robot Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots operating in complex, dynamic environments face the dual challenge of navigating large-scale, structurally diverse spaces with static obstacles while safely interacting with various moving agents. Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.</description>

      <title>A New Decomposition Paradigm for Graph-structured Nonlinear Programs via Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-sum nonlinear programs whose decision variables interact locally according to a graph or hypergraph. We propose MP-Jacobi (Message Passing-Jacobi), a graph-compliant decentralized framework that couples min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters. At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates. This design uses only single-hop communication and yields a convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.
  For strongly convex objectives we establish global linear convergence and explicit rates that quantify how curvature, coupling strength, and the chosen partition affect scalability and provide guidance for clustering. To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity. We further extend MP-Jacobi to hypergraphs; in heavily overlapping regimes, a surrogate-based hyperedge-splitting scheme restores finite-time intra-cluster message updates and maintains convergence. Experiments validate the theory and show consistent improvements over decentralized gradient baselines.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Insurance Pricing: A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning improves predictive accuracy in insurance pricing but exacerbates trade-offs between competing fairness criteria across different discrimination measures, challenging regulators and insurers to reconcile profitability with equitable outcomes. While existing fairness-aware models offer partial solutions under GLM and XGBoost estimation methods, they remain constrained by single-objective optimization, failing to holistically navigate a conflicting landscape of accuracy, group fairness, individual fairness, and counterfactual fairness. To address this, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework that jointly optimizes all four criteria via the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), generating a diverse Pareto front of trade-off solutions. We use a specific selection mechanism to extract a premium on this front. Our results show that XGBoost outperforms GLM in accuracy but amplifies fairness disparities; the Orthogonal model excels in group fairness, while Synthetic Control leads in individual and counterfactual fairness. Our method consistently achieves a balanced compromise, outperforming single-model approaches.</description>

      <title>Sparse Offline Reinforcement Learning with Corruption Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate robustness to strong data corruption in offline sparse reinforcement learning (RL). In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Adversarial Attack using Physics-in-the-Loop Optimization for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.</description>

      <title>LeanCat: A Benchmark Suite for Formal Category Theory in Lean (Part I: 1-Categories)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in formal theorem proving, yet current benchmarks under-measure the kind of abstraction and library-mediated reasoning that organizes modern mathematics. In parallel with FATE's emphasis on frontier algebra, we introduce LeanCat, a Lean benchmark for category-theoretic formalization -- a unifying language for mathematical structure and a core layer of modern proof engineering -- serving as a stress test of structural, interface-level reasoning. Part I: 1-Categories contains 100 fully formalized statement-level tasks, curated into topic families and three difficulty tiers via an LLM-assisted + human grading process. The best model solves 8.25% of tasks at pass@1 (32.50%/4.17%/0.00% by Easy/Medium/High) and 12.00% at pass@4 (50.00%/4.76%/0.00%). We also evaluate LeanBridge which use LeanExplore to search Mathlib, and observe consistent gains over single-model baselines. LeanCat is intended as a compact, reusable checkpoint for tracking both AI and human progress toward reliable, research-level formalization in Lean.</description>

      <title>Limits of quantum generative models with classical sampling hardness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling tasks have been successful in establishing quantum advantages both in theory and experiments. This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration.</description>

      <title>Learning Temporally Consistent Turbulence Between Sparse Snapshots via Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical accuracy of temporally interpolated spatiotemporal flow sequences between sparse, decorrelated snapshots of turbulent flow fields using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The developed method is presented as a proof-of-concept generative surrogate for reconstructing coherent turbulent dynamics between sparse snapshots, demonstrated on a 2D Kolmogorov Flow, and a 3D Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI). We analyse the generated flow sequences through the lens of statistical turbulence, examining the time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy spectra over generated sequences, and temporal decay of turbulent structures. For the non-stationary Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability, we assess the ability of the proposed method to capture evolving flow statistics across the most strongly time-varying flow regime. We additionally examine instantaneous fields and physically motivated metrics at key stages of the KHI flow evolution.</description>

      <title>mHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.</description>

      <title>Are First-Order Diffusion Samplers Really Slower? A Fast Forward-Value Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order ODE solvers have become a standard tool for accelerating diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling, motivating the widespread view that first-order methods are inherently slower and that increasing discretization order is the primary path to faster generation. This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.
  We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization Framework for Multi-Step LLM Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.</description>

      <title>Iterative Deployment Improves Planning Skills in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search relevance plays a central role in web e-commerce. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant results on relevance task, existing benchmarks lack sufficient complexity for comprehensive model assessment, resulting in an absence of standardized relevance evaluation metrics across the industry. To address this limitation, we propose Rule-Aware benchmark with Image for Relevance assessment(RAIR), a Chinese dataset derived from real-world scenarios. RAIR established a standardized framework for relevance assessment and provides a set of universal rules, which forms the foundation for standardized evaluation. Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR data are now available, serving as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment while providing new insights into general LLM and Visual Language Model(VLM) evaluation.</description>

      <title>ProDM: Synthetic Reality-driven Property-aware Progressive Diffusion Model for Coronary Calcium Motion Correction in Non-gated Chest CT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.</description>

      <title>SymSeqBench: a unified framework for the generation and analysis of rule-based symbolic sequences and datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential structure is a key feature of multiple domains of natural cognition and behavior, such as language, movement and decision-making. Likewise, it is also a central property of tasks to which we would like to apply artificial intelligence. It is therefore of great importance to develop frameworks that allow us to evaluate sequence learning and processing in a domain agnostic fashion, whilst simultaneously providing a link to formal theories of computation and computability. To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms. The tool is modular, openly available and accessible to the research community.</description>

      <title>DarkEQA: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Embodied Question Answering in Low-Light Indoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Basic Inequalities for First-Order Optimization with Applications to Statistical Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce \textit{basic inequalities} for first-order iterative optimization algorithms, forming a simple and versatile framework that connects implicit and explicit regularization. While related inequalities appear in the literature, we isolate and highlight a specific form and develop it as a well-rounded tool for statistical analysis. Let $f$ denote the objective function to be optimized. Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $\theta_0$ with current iterate $\theta_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(\theta_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $\theta_0$, $\theta_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors. We illustrate and supplement these theoretical findings with experiments on generalized linear models.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the generalization error for deep gradient flow methods for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide a firm mathematical foundation for the application of deep gradient flow methods (DGFMs) for the solution of (high-dimensional) partial differential equations (PDEs). We decompose the generalization error of DGFMs into an approximation and a training error. We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approximated by neural networks, thus the approximation error tends to zero as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity. These results combined show that the generalization error of DGFMs tends to zero as the number of neurons and the training time tend to infinity.</description>

      <title>Reliable and Resilient Collective Communication Library for LLM Training and Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern ML training and inference now span tens to tens of thousands of GPUs, where network faults can waste 10--15\% of GPU hours due to slow recovery. Common network errors and link fluctuations trigger timeouts that often terminate entire jobs, forcing expensive checkpoint rollback during training and request reprocessing during inference. We present R$^2$CCL, a fault-tolerant communication library that provides lossless, low-overhead failover by exploiting multi-NIC hardware. R$^2$CCL performs rapid connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient collective algorithms to maintain progress under failures. We evaluate R$^2$CCL on two 8-GPU H100 InfiniBand servers and via large-scale ML simulators modeling hundreds of GPUs with diverse failure patterns. Experiments show that R$^2$CCL is highly robust to NIC failures, incurring less than 1\% training and less than 3\% inference overheads. R$^2$CCL outperforms baselines AdapCC and DejaVu by 12.18$\times$ and 47$\times$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Humanoid Manipulation with Choice Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge. We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Approximation -- Smoothness Tradeoffs for Soft-Max Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.11450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A soft-max function has two main efficiency measures: (1) approximation - which corresponds to how well it approximates the maximum function, (2) smoothness - which shows how sensitive it is to changes of its input. Our goal is to identify the optimal approximation-smoothness tradeoffs for different measures of approximation and smoothness. This leads to novel soft-max functions, each of which is optimal for a different application. The most commonly used soft-max function, called exponential mechanism, has optimal tradeoff between approximation measured in terms of expected additive approximation and smoothness measured with respect to R\'enyi Divergence. We introduce a soft-max function, called "piecewise linear soft-max", with optimal tradeoff between approximation, measured in terms of worst-case additive approximation and smoothness, measured with respect to $\ell_q$-norm. The worst-case approximation guarantee of the piecewise linear mechanism enforces sparsity in the output of our soft-max function, a property that is known to be important in Machine Learning applications [Martins et al. '16, Laha et al. '18] and is not satisfied by the exponential mechanism. Moreover, the $\ell_q$-smoothness is suitable for applications in Mechanism Design and Game Theory where the piecewise linear mechanism outperforms the exponential mechanism. Finally, we investigate another soft-max function, called power mechanism, with optimal tradeoff between expected \textit{multiplicative} approximation and smoothness with respect to the R\'enyi Divergence, which provides improved theoretical and practical results in differentially private submodular optimization.</description>

      <title>Active Learning with Neural Networks: Insights from Nonparametric Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have great representation power, but typically require large numbers of training examples. This motivates deep active learning methods that can significantly reduce the amount of labeled training data. Empirical successes of deep active learning have been recently reported in the literature, however, rigorous label complexity guarantees of deep active learning have remained elusive. This constitutes a significant gap between theory and practice. This paper tackles this gap by providing the first near-optimal label complexity guarantees for deep active learning. The key insight is to study deep active learning from the nonparametric classification perspective. Under standard low noise conditions, we show that active learning with neural networks can provably achieve the minimax label complexity, up to disagreement coefficient and other logarithmic terms. When equipped with an abstention option, we further develop an efficient deep active learning algorithm that achieves $\mathsf{polylog}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ label complexity, without any low noise assumptions. We also provide extensions of our results beyond the commonly studied Sobolev/H\"older spaces and develop label complexity guarantees for learning in Radon $\mathsf{BV}^2$ spaces, which have recently been proposed as natural function spaces associated with neural networks.</description>

      <title>The Power of Preconditioning in Overparameterized Low-Rank Matrix Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$, a preconditioned gradient descent method to tackle the low-rank matrix sensing problem when the true rank is unknown, and when the matrix is possibly ill-conditioned. Using overparametrized factor representations, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ starts from a small random initialization, and proceeds by gradient descent with a specific form of damped preconditioning to combat bad curvatures induced by overparameterization and ill-conditioning. At the expense of light computational overhead incurred by preconditioners, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ is remarkably robust to ill-conditioning compared to vanilla gradient descent ($\textsf{GD}$) even with overprameterization. Specifically, we show that, under the Gaussian design, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ converges to the true low-rank matrix at a constant linear rate after a small number of iterations that scales only logarithmically with respect to the condition number and the problem dimension. This significantly improves over the convergence rate of vanilla $\textsf{GD}$ which suffers from a polynomial dependency on the condition number. Our work provides evidence on the power of preconditioning in accelerating the convergence without hurting generalization in overparameterized learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most real-world graphs exhibit a hierarchical structure, which is often overlooked by existing graph generation methods. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph generative network that captures the hierarchical nature of graphs and successively generates the graph sub-structures in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of hierarchy, this model generates communities in parallel, followed by the prediction of cross-edges between communities using separate neural networks. This modular approach enables scalable graph generation for large and complex graphs. Moreover, we model the output distribution of edges in the hierarchical graph with a multinomial distribution and derive a recursive factorization for this distribution. This enables us to generate community graphs with integer-valued edge weights in an autoregressive manner. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed generative model, achieving state-ofthe-art performance in terms of graph quality across various benchmark datasets.

      <description>arXiv:2402.18508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of deep learning, the demand for models that are both expressive and computationally efficient has never been more critical. This paper introduces Orchid, a novel architecture designed to address the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms without compromising the ability to capture long-range dependencies and in-context learning. At the core of this architecture lies a new data-dependent global convolution layer, which contextually adapts its kernel conditioned on input sequence using a dedicated conditioning neural network. We design two simple conditioning networks that maintain shift equivariance in our data-dependent convolution operation. The dynamic nature of the proposed convolution kernel grants Orchid high expressivity while maintaining quasilinear scalability for long sequences. We evaluate the proposed model across multiple domains, including language modeling and image classification, to highlight its performance and generality. Our experiments demonstrate that this architecture not only outperforms traditional attention-based architectures such as BERT and Vision Transformers with smaller model sizes, but also extends the feasible sequence length beyond the limitations of the dense attention layers. This achievement represents a significant step towards more efficient and scalable deep learning models for sequence modeling.

      <description>arXiv:2403.07688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When training neural networks, dying neurons -- units becoming inactive or saturated -- are traditionally seen as harmful. This paper sheds new light on this phenomenon. By exploring the impact of various hyperparameter configurations on dying neurons during training, we gather insights on how to improve upon sparse training approaches to pruning. We introduce Demon Pruning (DemP), a method that controls the proliferation of dead neurons through a combination of noise injection on active units and a one-cycle schedule regularization strategy, dynamically leading to network sparsity. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that DemP outperforms existing dense-to-sparse structured pruning methods, achieving better accuracy-sparsity tradeoffs and accelerating training by up to 3.56$\times$. These findings provide a novel perspective on dying neurons as a resource for efficient model compression and optimization.</description>

      <title>Spectral Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13182v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are meta-learning models that learn to map sets of observations to approximations of the corresponding posterior predictive distributions. By accommodating variable-sized, unstructured collections of observations and enabling probabilistic predictions at arbitrary query points, NPs provide a flexible framework for modeling functions over continuous domains. Since their introduction, numerous variants have emerged; however, early formulations shared a fundamental limitation: they compressed the observed data into finite-dimensional global representations via aggregation operations such as mean pooling. This strategy induces an intrinsic mismatch with the infinite-dimensional nature of the stochastic processes that NPs intend to model. Convolutional conditional neural processes (ConvCNPs) address this limitation by constructing infinite-dimensional functional embeddings processed through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enforce translation equivariance. Yet CNNs with local spatial kernels struggle to capture long-range dependencies without resorting to large kernels, which impose significant computational costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose spectral ConvCNPs (SConvCNPs), which perform global convolution in the frequency domain. Inspired by Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs), our approach directly parameterizes convolution kernels in the frequency domain, leveraging the relatively compact yet global Fourier representation of many natural signals. We validate the effectiveness of SConvCNPs on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating how ideas from operator learning can advance the capabilities of NPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jacobian-Enhanced Neural Networks (JENN) are densely connected multi-layer perceptrons, whose training process is modified to predict partial derivatives accurately. Their main benefit is better accuracy with fewer training points compared to standard neural networks. These attributes are particularly desirable in the field of computer-aided design, where there is often the need to replace computationally expensive, physics-based models with fast running approximations, known as surrogate models or meta-models. Since a surrogate emulates the original model accurately in near-real time, it yields a speed benefit that can be used to carry out orders of magnitude more function calls quickly. However, in the special case of gradient-enhanced methods, there is the additional value proposition that partial derivatives are accurate, which is a critical property for one important use-case: surrogate-based optimization. This work derives the complete theory and exemplifies its superiority over standard neural nets for surrogate-based optimization.</description>

      <title>UnPaSt: unsupervised patient stratification by biclustering of omics data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised patient stratification is essential for disease subtype discovery, yet, despite growing evidence of molecular heterogeneity of non-oncological diseases, popular methods are benchmarked primarily using cancers with mutually exclusive molecular subtypes well-differentiated by numerous biomarkers. Evaluating 22 unsupervised methods, including clustering and biclustering, using simulated and real transcriptomics data revealed their inefficiency in scenarios with non-mutually exclusive subtypes or subtypes discriminated only by few biomarkers. To address these limitations and advance precision medicine, we developed UnPaSt, a novel biclustering algorithm for unsupervised patient stratification based on differentially expressed biclusters. UnPaSt outperformed widely used patient stratification approaches in the de novo identification of known subtypes of breast cancer and asthma. In addition, it detected many biologically insightful patterns across bulk transcriptomics, proteomics, single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, and multi-omics datasets, enabling a more nuanced and interpretable view of high-throughput data heterogeneity than traditionally used methods.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of state-based potential games for process optimization in decentralized manufacturing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel online transfer learning approach in state-based potential games (TL-SbPGs) for distributed self-optimization in manufacturing systems. The approach targets practical industrial scenarios where knowledge sharing among similar players enhances learning in large-scale and decentralized environments. TL-SbPGs enable players to reuse learned policies from others, which improves learning outcomes and accelerates convergence. To accomplish this goal, we develop transfer learning concepts and similarity criteria for players, which offer two distinct settings: (a) predefined similarities between players and (b) dynamically inferred similarities between players during training. The applicability of the SbPG framework to transfer learning is formally established. Furthermore, we present a method to optimize the timing and weighting of knowledge transfer. Experimental results from a laboratory-scale testbed show that TL-SbPGs improve production efficiency and reduce power consumption compared to vanilla SbPGs.</description>

      <title>Model Merging in LLMs, MLLMs, and Beyond: Methods, Theories, Applications and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07666v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model merging is an efficient empowerment technique in the machine learning community that does not require the collection of raw training data and does not require expensive computation. As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a systematic and thorough review of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of model merging methods and theories, their applications in various domains and settings, and future research directions. Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and more than ten machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions. A comprehensive list of papers about model merging is available at https://github.com/EnnengYang/Awesome-Model-Merging-Methods-Theories-Applications.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Survey on Large Language Models for Algorithm Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14716v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithm design is crucial for effective problem-solving across various domains. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has notably enhanced the automation and innovation within this field, offering new perspectives and promising solutions. In just a few years, this integration has yielded remarkable progress in areas ranging from combinatorial optimization to scientific discovery. Despite this rapid expansion, a holistic understanding of the field is hindered by the lack of a systematic review, as existing surveys either remain limited to narrow sub-fields or with different objectives. This paper seeks to provide a systematic review of algorithm design with LLMs. We introduce a taxonomy that categorises the roles of LLMs as optimizers, predictors, extractors and designers, analyzing the progress, advantages, and limitations within each category. We further synthesize literature across the three phases of the algorithm design pipeline and across diverse algorithmic applications that define the current landscape. Finally, we outline key open challenges and opportunities to guide future research.</description>

      <title>Minibatch Optimal Transport and Perplexity Bound Estimation in Discrete Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete flow matching, a recent framework for modeling categorical data, has shown competitive performance with autoregressive models. However, unlike continuous flow matching, the rectification strategy cannot be applied due to the stochasticity of discrete paths, necessitating alternative methods to minimize state transitions. We propose a dynamic-optimal-transport-like minimization objective and derive its Kantorovich formulation for discrete flows with convex interpolants, where transport cost depends solely on inter-state similarity and can be optimized via minibatch strategies. In the case of bag-of-words (BoW) sourced flows, we show that such methods can reduce the number of transitions up to 8 times (1024 to 128) to reach the same generative perplexity without compromising diversity. Additionally, path nondeterminism in discrete flows precludes an instantaneous change-of-variables analogue, preventing precise probability estimation available to continuous flows. We therefore propose two upper bounds on perplexity, enabling principled training, evaluation and model comparison. Finally, we introduce Multimask Flows which outperform masked flows in generative perplexity, particularly when utilizing minibatch Optimal Transport, without sacrificing diversity.</description>

      <title>The Generalization Error of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the method of gaps, a technique for deriving closed-form expressions in terms of information measures for the generalization error of supervised machine learning algorithms is introduced. The method relies on the notion of \emph{gaps}, which characterize the variation of the expected empirical risk (when either the model or dataset is kept fixed) with respect to changes in the probability measure on the varying parameter (either the dataset or the model, respectively). This distinction results in two classes of gaps: Algorithm-driven gaps (fixed dataset) and data-driven gaps (fixed model). In general, the method relies on two central observations: $(i)$~The generalization error is the expectation of an algorithm-driven gap or a data-driven gap. In the first case, the expectation is with respect to a measure on the datasets; and in the second case, with respect to a measure on the models. $(ii)$~Both, algorithm-driven gaps and data-driven gaps exhibit closed-form expressions in terms of relative entropies. In particular, algorithm-driven gaps involve a Gibbs probability measure on the set of models, which represents a supervised Gibbs algorithm. Alternatively, data-driven gaps involve a worst-case data-generating (WCDG) probability measure on the set of data points, which is also a Gibbs probability measure. Interestingly, such Gibbs measures, which are exogenous to the analysis of generalization, place both the supervised Gibbs algorithm and the WCDG probability measure as natural references for the analysis of supervised learning algorithms. All existing exact expressions for the generalization error of supervised machine learning algorithms can be obtained with the proposed method. Also, this method allows obtaining numerous new exact expressions, which allows establishing connections with other areas in statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear regression is a fundamental tool for statistical analysis, which has motivated the development of linear regression methods that satisfy provable privacy guarantees so that the learned model reveals little about any one data point used to construct it. Most existing privacy-preserving linear regression methods rely on the well-established framework of differential privacy, while the newly proposed PAC Privacy has not yet been explored in this context. In this paper, we systematically compare linear regression models trained with differential privacy and PAC privacy across three real-world datasets, observing several key findings that impact the performance of privacy-preserving linear regression.</description>

      <title>SoundnessBench: A Soundness Benchmark for Neural Network Verifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network (NN) verification aims to formally verify properties of NNs, which is crucial for ensuring the behavior of NN-based models in safety-critical applications. In recent years, the community has developed many NN verifiers and benchmarks to evaluate them. However, existing benchmarks typically lack ground-truth for hard instances where no current verifier can verify the property and no counterexample can be found. This makes it difficult to validate the soundness of a verifier, when it claims verification on such challenging instances that no other verifier can handle. In this work, we develop a new benchmark for NN verification, named SoundnessBench, specifically for testing the soundness of NN verifiers. SoundnessBench consists of instances with deliberately inserted counterexamples that are hidden from adversarial attacks commonly used to find counterexamples. Thereby, it can identify false verification claims when hidden counterexamples are known to exist. We design a training method to produce NNs with hidden counterexamples and systematically construct our SoundnessBench with instances across various model architectures, activation functions, and input data. We demonstrate that our training effectively produces hidden counterexamples and our SoundnessBench successfully identifies bugs in state-of-the-art NN verifiers. Our code is available at https://github.com/mvp-harry/SoundnessBench and our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SoundnessBench/SoundnessBench.</description>

      <title>Tazza: Shuffling Neural Network Parameters for Secure and Private Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning enables decentralized model training without sharing raw data, preserving data privacy. However, its vulnerability towards critical security threats, such as gradient inversion and model poisoning by malicious clients, remain unresolved. Existing solutions often address these issues separately, sacrificing either system robustness or model accuracy. This work introduces Tazza, a secure and efficient federated learning framework that simultaneously addresses both challenges. By leveraging the permutation equivariance and invariance properties of neural networks via weight shuffling and shuffled model validation, Tazza enhances resilience against diverse poisoning attacks, while ensuring data confidentiality and high model accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations on various datasets and embedded platforms show that Tazza achieves robust defense with up to 6.7x improved computational efficiency compared to alternative schemes, without compromising performance.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Index Policy for Restless Bandits with Average Reward</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Lagrangian Index Policy (LIP) for restless multi-armed bandits with long-run average reward. In particular, we compare the performance of LIP with the performance of the Whittle Index Policy (WIP), both heuristic policies known to be asymptotically optimal under certain natural conditions. Even though in most cases their performances are very similar, in the cases when WIP shows bad performance, LIP continues to perform very well. We then propose reinforcement learning algorithms, both tabular and NN-based, to obtain online learning schemes for LIP in the model-free setting. The proposed reinforcement learning schemes for LIP require significantly less memory than the analogous schemes for WIP. We calculate analytically the Lagrangian index for the restart model, which applies to the optimal web crawling and the minimization of the weighted age of information. We also give a new proof of asymptotic optimality in case of homogeneous arms as the number of arms goes to infinity, based on exchangeability and de Finetti's theorem.</description>

      <title>Detection of AI Deepfake and Fraud in Online Payments Using GAN-Based Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to detect AI deepfakes and fraudulent activities in online payment systems. With the growing prevalence of deepfake technology, which can manipulate facial features in images and videos, the potential for fraud in online transactions has escalated. Traditional security systems struggle to identify these sophisticated forms of fraud. This research proposes a novel GAN-based model that enhances online payment security by identifying subtle manipulations in payment images. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of real-world online payment images and deepfake images generated using advanced GAN architectures, such as StyleGAN and DeepFake. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately distinguish between legitimate transactions and deepfakes, achieving a high detection rate above 95%. This approach significantly improves the robustness of payment systems against AI-driven fraud. The paper contributes to the growing field of digital security, offering insights into the application of GANs for fraud detection in financial services.

      <title>Knowledge-Driven Federated Graph Learning on Model Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative graph representation learning, enabling multiple parties to jointly train models while preserving data privacy. However, most existing approaches assume homogeneous client models and largely overlook the challenge of model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL), which frequently arises in practice when organizations employ graph neural networks (GNNs) of different scales and architectures.Such architectural diversity not only undermines smooth server-side aggregation, which presupposes a unified representation space shared across clients' updates, but also further complicates the transfer and integration of structural knowledge across clients. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework. FedGKC introduces a lightweight Copilot Model on each client to facilitate knowledge exchange while local architectures are heterogeneous across clients, and employs two complementary mechanisms: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which transfers effective knowledge between local and copilot models through bidirectional distillation with multi-view perturbation; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which dynamically assigns aggregation weights based on knowledge provided by clients. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy gain of 3.88% over baselines in MHtFGL scenarios, while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>Local-Cloud Inference Offloading for LLMs in Multi-Modal, Multi-Task, Multi-Dialogue Settings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to traditional machine learning models, recent large language models (LLMs) can exhibit multi-task-solving capabilities through multiple dialogues and multi-modal data sources. These unique characteristics of LLMs, together with their large model size, make their deployment more challenging. Specifically, (i) deploying LLMs on local devices faces computational, memory, and energy resource issues, while (ii) deploying them in the cloud cannot guarantee real-time service and incurs communication/usage costs. In this paper, we design TMO, a local-cloud LLM inference system with Three-M Offloading: Multi-modal, Multi-task, and Multi-dialogue. TMO incorporates (i) a lightweight local LLM that can process simple tasks at high speed and (ii) a large-scale cloud LLM that can handle multi-modal data sources. We develop a resource-constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) strategy for TMO that optimizes the inference location (i.e., local vs. cloud) and multi-modal data sources to use for each task/dialogue, aiming to maximize the long-term reward (response quality, latency, and usage cost) while adhering to resource constraints. We also contribute M4A1, a new dataset we curated that contains reward and cost metrics across multiple modality, task, dialogue, and LLM configurations, enabling evaluation of offloading decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TMO compared to several exploration-decision and LLM-as-Agent baselines, showing significant improvements in latency, cost, and response quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boosting is a key method in statistical learning, allowing for converting weak learners into strong ones. While well studied in the realizable case, the statistical properties of weak-to-strong learning remain less understood in the agnostic setting, where there are no assumptions on the distribution of the labels. In this work, we propose a new agnostic boosting algorithm with substantially improved sample complexity compared to prior works under very general assumptions. Our approach is based on a reduction to the realizable case, followed by a margin-based filtering of high-quality hypotheses. Furthermore, we show a nearly-matching lower bound, settling the sample complexity of agnostic boosting up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Count Quantification Learning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantification learning is the task of predicting the label distribution of a set of instances. We study this problem in the context of graph-structured data, where the instances are vertices. Previously, this problem has only been addressed via node clustering methods. In this paper, we extend the popular Adjusted Classify &amp; Count (ACC) method to graphs. We show that the prior probability shift assumption upon which ACC relies is often not applicable to graph quantification problems. To address this issue, we propose structural importance sampling (SIS), the first graph quantification method that is applicable under (structural) covariate shift. Additionally, we propose Neighborhood-aware ACC, which improves quantification in the presence of non-homophilic edges. We show the effectiveness of our techniques on multiple graph quantification tasks.</description>

      <title>Lattice: Learning to Efficiently Compress the Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized sequence learning but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper introduces \model, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) mechanism that leverages the inherent low-rank structure of K-V matrices to efficiently compress the cache into a fixed number of memory slots, achieving sub-quadratic complexity. We formulate this compression as an online optimization problem and derive a dynamic memory update rule based on a single gradient descent step. The resulting recurrence features a state- and input-dependent gating mechanism, offering an interpretable memory update process. The core innovation is the orthogonal update: each memory slot is updated exclusively with information orthogonal to its current state, hence incorporating only novel, non-redundant data to minimize interference with previously stored information. We derive an efficient computation for this orthogonal update rule and further approximate it with chunk-wise parallelization to ensure training scalability. Empirically, Lattice outperforms strong baselines on language modeling and associative recall tasks across diverse context lengths and model sizes, achieving superior memory efficiency with significantly reduced memory sizes.</description>

      <title>ParetoHqD: Fast Offline Multiobjective Alignment of Large Language Models using Pareto High-quality Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning large language models with multiple human expectations and values is crucial for ensuring that they adequately serve a variety of user needs. To this end, offline multiobjective alignment algorithms such as the Rewards-in-Context algorithm have shown strong performance and efficiency. However, inappropriate preference representations and training with imbalanced reward scores limit the performance of such algorithms. In this work, we introduce ParetoHqD that addresses the above issues by representing human preferences as preference directions in the objective space and regarding data near the Pareto front as "high-quality" data. For each preference, ParetoHqD follows a two-stage supervised fine-tuning process, where each stage uses an individual Pareto high-quality training set that best matches its preference direction. The experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of ParetoHqD over five baselines on two multiobjective alignment tasks.</description>

      <title>ALF: Advertiser Large Foundation Model for Multi-Modal Advertiser Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ALF (Advertiser Large Foundation model), a multi-modal transformer architecture for understanding advertiser behavior and intent across text, image, video, and structured data modalities. Through contrastive learning and multi-task optimization, ALF creates unified advertiser representations that capture both content and behavioral patterns. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on critical tasks including fraud detection, policy violation identification, and advertiser similarity matching. In production deployment, ALF demonstrates significant real-world impact by delivering simultaneous gains in both precision and recall, for instance boosting recall by over 40 percentage points on one critical policy and increasing precision to 99.8% on another. The architecture's effectiveness stems from its novel combination of multi-modal transformations, inter-sample attention mechanism, spectrally normalized projections, and calibrated probabilistic outputs.</description>

      <title>Automatic Stage Lighting Control: Is it a Rule-Driven Process or Generative Task?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stage lighting is a vital component in live music performances, shaping an engaging experience for both musicians and audiences. In recent years, Automatic Stage Lighting Control (ASLC) has attracted growing interest due to the high costs of hiring or training professional lighting engineers. However, most existing ASLC solutions only classify music into limited categories and map them to predefined light patterns, resulting in formulaic and monotonous outcomes that lack rationality. To address this gap, this paper presents Skip-BART, an end-to-end model that directly learns from experienced lighting engineers and predict vivid, human-like stage lighting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to conceptualize ASLC as a generative task rather than merely a classification problem. Our method adapts the BART model to take audio music as input and produce light hue and value (intensity) as output, incorporating a novel skip connection mechanism to enhance the relationship between music and light within the frame grid. To address the lack of available datasets, we create the first stage lighting dataset, along with several pre-training and transfer learning techniques to improve model training with limited data. We validate our method through both quantitative analysis and an human evaluation, demonstrating that Skip-BART outperforms conventional rule-based methods across all evaluation metrics and shows only a limited gap compared to real lighting engineers. To support further research, we have made our self-collected dataset, code, and trained model parameters available at https://github.com/RS2002/Skip-BART .</description>

      <title>Not All Tokens Are Meant to Be Forgotten</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on massive text corpora, exhibit remarkable human-level language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities. However, they tend to memorize unwanted information, such as private or copyrighted content, raising significant privacy and legal concerns. Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution, but existing methods face a significant challenge of over-forgetting. This issue arises because they indiscriminately suppress the generation of all the tokens in forget samples, leading to a substantial loss of model utility. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Targeted Information Forgetting (TIF) framework, which consists of (1) a flexible targeted information identifier designed to differentiate between unwanted words (UW) and general words (GW) in the forget samples, and (2) a novel Targeted Preference Optimization approach that leverages Logit Preference Loss to unlearn unwanted information associated with UW and Preservation Loss to retain general information in GW, effectively improving the unlearning process while mitigating utility degradation. Extensive experiments on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TIF framework enhances unlearning effectiveness while preserving model utility and achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically Tightened Linear Relaxation-based Perturbation Analysis for Neural Network Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present $\textbf{P}$robabilistically $\textbf{T}$ightened $\textbf{Li}$near $\textbf{R}$elaxation-based $\textbf{P}$erturbation $\textbf{A}$nalysis ($\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$), a novel framework that combines over-approximation techniques from LiRPA-based approaches with a sampling-based method to compute tight intermediate reachable sets. In detail, we show that with negligible computational overhead, $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$ exploiting the estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear bounds of a neural network's output, reducing the computational cost of formal verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks, including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates, i.e., the certified lower bound of $\varepsilon$ perturbation tolerated by the models, by up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic approach results in a valuable solution for challenging competition entries where state-of-the-art formal verification methods fail, allowing us to provide answers with high confidence (i.e., at least 99%).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for solving differential equations (DEs), yet prevailing methodologies remain constrained by dual limitations: data-driven methods demand costly labeled datasets while model-driven techniques face efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. We present the Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) framework, a new paradigm that integrates physical laws with data-driven learning to facilitate large-scale operator discovery. By exploiting DEs' intrinsic mathematical structure to generate physics-embedded analytical solutions and associated synthetic data, MAD fundamentally eliminates dependence on experimental or simulated training data. This enables computationally efficient operator learning across multi-parameter systems while maintaining mathematical rigor. Through numerical demonstrations spanning 2D parametric problems where both the boundary values and source term are functions, we showcase MAD's generalizability and superior efficiency/accuracy across various DE scenarios. This physics-embedded-data-driven framework and its capacity to handle complex parameter spaces gives it the potential to become a universal paradigm for physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Gaussian Processes: A Tutorial and Applications in Global Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulations and physical experiments are essential for engineering analysis and design, yet their high cost often makes two critical tasks--global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and optimization--prohibitively expensive. This limitation motivates the common use of Gaussian processes (GPs) as proxy regression models that provide uncertainty-aware predictions from a limited number of high-quality observations. GPs naturally enable efficient sampling strategies that support informed decision-making under uncertainty by extracting information from a subset of possible functions for the model of interest. However, direct sampling from GPs is inefficient due to their infinite-dimensional nature and the high cost associated with large covariance matrix operations. Despite their popularity in machine learning and statistics communities, sampling from GPs has received little attention in the community of engineering optimization. In this paper, we present the formulation and detailed implementation of two notable sampling methods--random Fourier features and pathwise conditioning--for generating posterior samples from GPs at reduced computational cost. Alternative approaches are briefly described. Importantly, we detail how the generated samples can be applied in GSA, single-objective optimization, and multi-objective optimization. We show successful applications of these sampling methods through a series of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Learning Network Dismantling Without Handcrafted Inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of message-passing Graph Neural Networks has been a breakthrough for important network science problems. However, the competitive performance often relies on using handcrafted structural features as inputs, which increases computational cost and introduces bias into the otherwise purely data-driven network representations. Here, we eliminate the need for handcrafted features by introducing an attention mechanism and utilizing message-iteration profiles, in addition to an effective algorithmic approach to generate a structurally diverse training set of small synthetic networks. Thereby, we build an expressive message-passing framework and use it to efficiently solve the NP-hard problem of Network Dismantling, virtually equivalent to vital node identification, with significant real-world applications. Trained solely on diversified synthetic networks, our proposed model -- MIND: Message Iteration Network Dismantler -- generalizes to large, unseen real networks with millions of nodes, outperforming state-of-the-art network dismantling methods. Increased efficiency and generalizability of the proposed model can be leveraged beyond dismantling in a range of complex network problems.</description>

      <title>Forgetting: A New Mechanism Towards Better Large Language Model Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts -- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We conduct experiments across diverse and well-established benchmarks using various model architectures, demonstrating that this forgetting mechanism enhances model performance.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization with Heavy Tails: Old Algorithms, New Regrets, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Online Convex Optimization (OCO), when the stochastic gradient has a finite variance, many algorithms provably work and guarantee a sublinear regret. However, limited results are known if the gradient estimate has a heavy tail, i.e., the stochastic gradient only admits a finite $\mathsf{p}$-th central moment for some $\mathsf{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$. Motivated by it, this work examines different old algorithms for OCO (e.g., Online Gradient Descent) in the more challenging heavy-tailed setting. Under the standard bounded domain assumption, we establish new regrets for these classical methods without any algorithmic modification. Remarkably, these regret bounds are fully optimal in all parameters (can be achieved even without knowing $\mathsf{p}$), suggesting that OCO with heavy tails can be solved effectively without any extra operation (e.g., gradient clipping). Our new results have several applications. A particularly interesting one is the first provable and optimal convergence result for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise without gradient clipping. Furthermore, we explore broader settings (e.g., smooth OCO) and extend our ideas to optimistic algorithms to handle different cases simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Generalising Traffic Forecasting to Regions without Traffic Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally, we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>CrystalDiT: A Diffusion Transformer for Crystal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs, CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 8.78% SUN (Stable, Unique, Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including FlowMM (4.21%) and MatterGen (3.66%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28% unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates, demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.</description>

      <title>STRelay: A Universal Spatio-Temporal Relaying Framework for Location Prediction over Human Trajectory Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility modeling, enabling applications like travel planning and urban mobility management. Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay}, a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We evaluate STRelay integrated with five state-of-the-art location prediction base models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by 2.49\%-11.30\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at modeling regular daily routine patterns.</description>

      <title>RAST: A Retrieval Augmented Spatio-Temporal Framework for Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Natural Image Classification via Quasi-Cyclic Graph Ensembles and Random-Bond Ising Models at the Nishimori Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern multi-class image classification relies on high-dimensional CNN feature vectors, which are computationally expensive and obscure the underlying data geometry. Conventional graph-based classifiers degrade on natural multi-class images because typical graphs fail to preserve separability on feature manifolds with complex topology. We address this with a physics-inspired pipeline frozen MobileNetV2 embeddings are treated as Ising spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph forming a Random Bond Ising Model. The system is tuned to its Nishimori temperature identified where the smallest Bethe-Hessian eigenvalue vanishes. Our method rests on two innovations: we prove a spectral-topological correspondence linking graph trapping sets to invariants via the Ihara-Bass zeta function removing these structures boosts top-1 accuracy over four-fold in multi-class settings; we develop a quadratic-Newton estimator for the Nishimori temperature converging in around 9 Arnoldi iterations for a 6-times speedup enabling spectral embedding on scales like ImageNet-100. The resulting graphs compress 1280-dimensional MobileNetV2 features to 32 dimensions for ImageNet10 and 64 for ImageNet-100 We achieve 98.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 84.92% on ImageNet-100 with a three-graph soft ensemble Versus MobileNetV2 our hard ensemble increases top-1 by 0.1% while cutting FLOPs by 2.67-times compared to ResNet50 the soft ensemble drops top1 by only 1.09% yet reduces FLOPs by 29-times. Novelty lies in (a) rigorously linking trapping sets to topological defects, (b) an efficient Nishimori temperature estimator and (c) demonstrating that topology-guided LDPC embedding produces highly compressed accurate classifiers for resource-constrained deployment</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce open-sci-ref, a family of dense transformer models trained as research baselines across multiple model (0.13B to 1.7B parameters) and token scales (up to 1T) on 8 recent open reference datasets. Evaluating the models on various standardized benchmarks, our training runs set establishes reference points that enable researchers to assess the sanity and quality of alternative training approaches across scales and datasets. Intermediate checkpoints allow comparison and studying of the training dynamics. The established reference baselines allow training procedures to be compared through their scaling trends, aligning them on a common compute axis. Comparison of open reference datasets reveals that training on NemoTron-CC HQ consistently outperforms other reference datasets, followed by DCLM-baseline and FineWeb-Edu. In addition to intermediate training checkpoints, the release includes logs, code, and downstream evaluations to simplify reproduction, standardize comparison, and facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Towards Privacy-Preserving and Heterogeneity-aware Split Federated Learning via Probabilistic Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as an efficient alternative to traditional Federated Learning (FL) by reducing client-side computation through model partitioning. However, exchanging of intermediate activations and model updates introduces significant privacy risks, especially from data reconstruction attacks that recover original inputs from intermediate representations. Existing defenses using noise injection often degrade model performance. To overcome these challenges, we present PM-SFL, a scalable and privacy-preserving SFL framework that incorporates Probabilistic Mask training to add structured randomness without relying on explicit noise. This mitigates data reconstruction risks while maintaining model utility. To address data heterogeneity, PM-SFL employs personalized mask learning that tailors submodel structures to each client's local data. For system heterogeneity, we introduce a layer-wise knowledge compensation mechanism, enabling clients with varying resources to participate effectively under adaptive model splitting. Theoretical analysis confirms its privacy protection, and experiments on image and wireless sensing tasks demonstrate that PM-SFL consistently improves accuracy, communication efficiency, and robustness to privacy attacks, with particularly strong performance under data and system heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Personalized Enhanced Federated Multi-View Clustering via Heat-Kernel Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces mathematical frameworks that address the challenges of multi-view clustering in federated learning environments. The objective is to integrate optimization techniques based on new objective functions employing heat-kernel coefficients to replace conventional distance metrics with quantum-inspired measures. The proposed frameworks utilize advanced tensor decomposition methods, specifically, PARAFAC2 and Tucker decomposition to efficiently represent high-dimensional, multi-view data while preserving inter-view relationships. The research has yielded the development of four novel algorithms, an efficient federated kernel multi-view clustering (E-FKMVC) model, FedHK-PARAFAC2, FedHK-Tucker, and FedHK-MVC-Person with PARAFAC2 Decomposition (Personalized FedHK-PARAFAC2). The primary objective of these algorithms is to enhance the efficacy of clustering processes while ensuring the confidentiality and efficient communication in federated learning environments. Theoretical analyses of convergence guarantees, privacy bounds, and complexity are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In essence, this paper makes a significant academic contribution to the field of federated multi-view clustering through its innovative integration of mathematical modeling and algorithm design. This approach addresses the critical challenges of data heterogeneity and privacy concerns, paving the way for enhanced data management and analytics in various contexts.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Framework for ESP Cheater Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which further complicates detection and detector development. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing effective cheat detectors.</description>

      <title>Triple-BERT: Do We Really Need MARL for Order Dispatch on Ride-Sharing Platforms?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, face the intricate real-time challenge of bundling and matching passengers-each with distinct origins and destinations-to available vehicles, all while navigating significant system uncertainties. Due to the extensive observation space arising from the large number of drivers and orders, order dispatching, though fundamentally a centralized task, is often addressed using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, independent MARL methods fail to capture global information and exhibit poor cooperation among workers, while Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these challenges, we propose Triple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method designed specifically for large-scale order dispatching on ride-sharing platforms. Built on a variant TD3, our approach addresses the vast action space through an action decomposition strategy that breaks down the joint action probability into individual driver action probabilities. To handle the extensive observation space, we introduce a novel BERT-based network, where parameter reuse mitigates parameter growth as the number of drivers and orders increases, and the attention mechanism effectively captures the complex relationships among the large pool of driver and orders. We validate our method using a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Manhattan. Triple-BERT achieves approximately an 11.95% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, with a 4.26% increase in served orders and a 22.25% reduction in pickup times. Our code, trained model parameters, and processed data are publicly available at the repository https://github.com/RS2002/Triple-BERT .</description>

      <title>Graph Learning is Suboptimal in Causal Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study regret minimization in causal bandits under causal sufficiency where the underlying causal structure is not known to the agent. Previous work has focused on identifying the reward's parents and then applying classic bandit methods to them, or jointly learning the parents while minimizing regret. We investigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively, our results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by proving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze both the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret lower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space. Building on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass graph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed unnecessary for regret minimization. Experiments confirm that there exists a large performance gap between our method and existing baselines in various environments.</description>

      <title>On the limitation of evaluating machine unlearning using only a single training seed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically. Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model training. We illustrate that this is particularly relevant for MU methods that are deterministic, i.e., which always produce the same result when started from the same trained model. We therefore recommend that empirical comparisons of MU algorithms should also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.</description>

      <title>Deep sequence models tend to memorize geometrically; it is unclear why</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep sequence models are said to store atomic facts predominantly in the form of associative memory: a brute-force lookup of co-occurring entities. We identify a dramatically different form of storage of atomic facts that we term as geometric memory. Here, the model has synthesized embeddings encoding novel global relationships between all entities, including ones that do not co-occur in training. Such storage is powerful: for instance, we show how it transforms a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn $1$-step navigation task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, as against a lookup of local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical supervisory, architectural, or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, a geometry is learned even when it is more complex than the brute-force lookup.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points out to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery, and unlearning.</description>

Abstract: The Turing Test is no longer adequate for distinguishing human and machine intelligence. With advanced artificial intelligence systems already passing the original Turing Test and contributing to serious ethical and environmental concerns, we urgently need to update the test. This work expands upon the original imitation game by accounting for an additional factor: the energy spent answering the questions. By adding the constraint of energy, the new test forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources. Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial intelligence against its total resource cost.</description>

      <title>Feedback Descent: Open-Ended Text Optimization via Pairwise Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce \textit{Feedback Descent}, a framework that optimizes text artifacts -- prompts, code, and molecules -- through structured textual feedback, rather than relying solely on scalar rewards. By preserving detailed critiques instead of compressing them to binary preferences, Feedback Descent widens the information bottleneck in preference learning, enabling directed optimization in text space rather than weight space. We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision. The iteration loop is done purely at inference time, without modifying any model weights, and is task-agnostic. We evaluate Feedback Descent on three diverse domains and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization (GEPA), reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, REINVENT), and even specialized graph-based molecular optimizers. In the DOCKSTRING molecule discovery benchmark, Feedback Descent identifies novel drug-like molecules surpassing the $99.9$th percentile of a database with more than $260{,}000$ compounds across six protein targets.</description>

      <title>Complex variational autoencoders admit K\"ahler structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15172v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been discovered that latent-Euclidean variational autoencoders (VAEs) admit, in various capacities, Riemannian structure. We adapt these arguments but for complex VAEs with a complex latent stage. We show that complex VAEs reveal to some level K\"ahler geometric structure. Our methods will be tailored for decoder geometry. We derive the Fisher information metric in the complex case under a latent complex Gaussian with trivial relation matrix. It is well known from statistical information theory that the Fisher information coincides with the Hessian of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Thus, the metric K\"ahler potential relation is exactly achieved under relative entropy. We propose a K\"ahler potential derivative of complex Gaussian mixtures that acts as a rough proxy to the Fisher information metric while still being faithful to the underlying K\"ahler geometry. Computation of the metric via this potential is efficient, and through our potential, valid as a plurisubharmonic (PSH) function, large scale computational burden of automatic differentiation is displaced to small scale. Our methods leverage the law of total covariance to bridge behavior between our potential and the Fisher metric. We show that we can regularize the latent space with decoder geometry, and that we can sample in accordance with a weighted complex volume element. We demonstrate these strategies, at the exchange of sample variation, yield consistently smoother representations and fewer semantic outliers.</description>

      <title>GRASP: GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Robust Inference of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) provides a scalable alternative to full-model adaptation by updating only a small subset of parameters in large pre-trained models. We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K &lt;&lt; D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base &amp; RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit. Under varying levels of noise, StochGRASP consistently outperforms deterministic variants, demonstrating its suitability for energy-efficient and noise-prone hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>Group Representational Position Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GRAPE (Group RepresentAtional Position Encoding), a unified framework for positional encoding based on group actions. GRAPE brings together two families of mechanisms: (i) multiplicative rotations (Multiplicative GRAPE) in $\mathrm{SO}(d)$ and (ii) additive logit biases (Additive GRAPE) arising from unipotent actions in the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}$. In Multiplicative GRAPE, a position $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ (or $t \in \mathbb{R}$) acts as $\mathbf{G}(n)=\exp(n\,\omega\,\mathbf{L})$ with a rank-2 skew generator $\mathbf{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, yielding a relative, compositional, norm-preserving map with a closed-form matrix exponential. RoPE is recovered exactly when the $d/2$ planes are the canonical coordinate pairs with log-uniform spectrum. Learned commuting subspaces and compact non-commuting mixtures strictly extend this geometry to capture cross-subspace feature coupling at $O(d)$ and $O(r d)$ cost per head, respectively. In Additive GRAPE, additive logits arise as rank-1 (or low-rank) unipotent actions, recovering ALiBi and the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) as exact special cases while preserving an exact relative law and streaming cacheability. Altogether, GRAPE supplies a principled design space for positional geometry in long-context models, subsuming RoPE and ALiBi as special cases.

      <title>OPTIMA: Optimal One-shot Pruning for LLMs via Quadratic Programming Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-training model pruning is a promising solution, yet it faces a trade-off: simple heuristics that zero weights are fast but degrade accuracy, while principled joint optimization methods recover accuracy but are computationally infeasible at modern scale. One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement. On an NVIDIA H100, OPTIMA prunes a 8B-parameter transformer end-to-end in 40 hours with 60GB peak memory. Together, these results set a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for one-shot post-training pruning.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Perturbation Modeling Through Biomedical Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how small molecules perturb gene expression is essential for uncovering drug mechanisms, predicting off-target effects, and identifying repurposing opportunities. While prior deep learning frameworks have integrated multimodal embeddings into biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) and further improved these representations through graph neural network message-passing paradigms, these models have been applied to tasks such as link prediction and binary drug-disease association, rather than the task of gene perturbation, which may unveil more about mechanistic transcriptomic effects. To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits. Ablation experiments with edge shuffling and node feature randomization further demonstrate that the edges provided by biomedical KGs enhance perturbation-level prediction. More broadly, our framework provides a path toward mechanistic drug modeling: moving beyond binary drug-disease association tasks to granular transcriptional effects of therapeutic intervention.</description>

      <title>Federated Multi-Task Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral clustering has emerged as one of the most effective clustering algorithms due to its superior performance. However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Context-Aware Temporal Modeling through Unified Multi-Scale Temporal Encoding and Hierarchical Sequence Learning for Single-Channel EEG Sleep Staging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic sleep staging is a critical task in healthcare due to the global prevalence of sleep disorders. This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively improves sleep staging performance while maintaining interpretability and suitability for real-world clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Parameter Efficient Methods for RLVR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically evaluate Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods under the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). RLVR incentivizes language models to enhance their reasoning capabilities through verifiable feedback; however, while methods like LoRA are commonly used, the optimal PEFT architecture for RLVR remains unidentified. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results challenge the default adoption of standard LoRA with three main findings. First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization. Furthermore, our ablations reveal that extreme parameter reduction (\textit{e.g.,} VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity. We further conduct ablation studies and scaling experiments to validate our findings. This work provides a definitive guide for advocating for more exploration for parameter-efficient RL methods.</description>

      <title>KernelEvolve: Scaling Agentic Kernel Coding for Heterogeneous AI Accelerators at Meta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note introduces Isometric Policy Optimization (ISOPO), an efficient method to approximate the natural policy gradient in a single gradient step. In comparison, existing proximal policy methods such as GRPO or CISPO use multiple gradient steps with variants of importance ratio clipping to approximate a natural gradient step relative to a reference policy. In its simplest form, ISOPO normalizes the log-probability gradient of each sequence in the Fisher metric before contracting with the advantages. Another variant of ISOPO transforms the microbatch advantages based on the neural tangent kernel in each layer. ISOPO applies this transformation layer-wise in a single backward pass and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead compared to vanilla REINFORCE.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Test-Time Training for Long Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Efficient Active Learning with Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of active learning is to achieve the same accuracy achievable by passive learning, while using much fewer labels. Exponential savings in terms of label complexity have been proved in very special cases, but fundamental lower bounds show that such improvements are impossible in general. This suggests a need to explore alternative goals for active learning. Learning with abstention is one such alternative. In this setting, the active learning algorithm may abstain from prediction and incur an error that is marginally smaller than random guessing. We develop the first computationally efficient active learning algorithm with abstention. Our algorithm provably achieves $\mathsf{polylog}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ label complexity, without any low noise conditions. Such performance guarantee reduces the label complexity by an exponential factor, relative to passive learning and active learning that is not allowed to abstain. Furthermore, our algorithm is guaranteed to only abstain on hard examples (where the true label distribution is close to a fair coin), a novel property we term proper abstention that also leads to a host of other desirable characteristics (e.g., recovering minimax guarantees in the standard setting, and avoiding the undesirable "noise-seeking" behavior often seen in active learning). We also provide novel extensions of our algorithm that achieve constant label complexity and deal with model misspecification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop empirical models that efficiently process large amounts of unstructured product data (text, images, prices, quantities) to produce accurate hedonic price estimates and derived indices. To achieve this, we generate abstract product attributes (or ``features'') from descriptions and images using deep neural networks. These attributes are then used to estimate the hedonic price function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we apply the models to Amazon's data for first-party apparel sales, and estimate hedonic prices. The resulting models have a very high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ ranging from $80\%$ to $90\%$. Finally, we construct the AI-based hedonic Fisher price index, chained at the year-over-year frequency, and contrast it with the CPI and other electronic indices.</description>

Abstract: We consider the supervised learning problem of learning the price of an option or the implied volatility given appropriate input data (model parameters) and corresponding output data (option prices or implied volatilities). The majority of articles in this literature considers a (plain) feed forward neural network architecture in order to connect the neurons used for learning the function mapping inputs to outputs. In this article, motivated by methods in image classification and recent advances in machine learning methods for PDEs, we investigate empirically whether and how the choice of network architecture affects the accuracy and training time of a machine learning algorithm. We find that the generalized highway network architecture achieves the best performance, when considering the mean squared error and the training time as criteria, within the considered parameter budgets for the Black-Scholes and Heston option pricing problems. Considering the transformed implied volatility problem, a simplified DGM variant achieves the lowest error among the tested architectures. We also carry out a capacity-normalised comparison for completeness, where all architectures are evaluated with an equal number of parameters. Finally, for the implied volatility problem, we additionally include experiments using real market data.</description>

      <title>Generative Modelling of L\'evy Area for High Order SDE Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well understood that, when numerically simulating SDEs with general noise, achieving a strong convergence rate better than $O(\sqrt{h})$ (where h is the step size) requires the use of certain iterated integrals of Brownian motion, commonly referred to as its "L\'evy areas". However, these stochastic integrals are difficult to simulate due to their non-Gaussian nature and for a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion with $d &gt; 2$, no fast almost-exact sampling algorithm is known.
  In this paper, we propose L\'evyGAN, a deep-learning-based model for generating approximate samples of L\'evy area conditional on a Brownian increment. Due to our "Bridge-flipping" operation, the output samples match all joint and conditional odd moments exactly. Our generator employs a tailored GNN-inspired architecture, which enforces the correct dependency structure between the output distribution and the conditioning variable. Furthermore, we incorporate a mathematically principled characteristic-function based discriminator. Lastly, we introduce a novel training mechanism termed "Chen-training", which circumvents the need for expensive-to-generate training data-sets. This new training procedure is underpinned by our two main theoretical results.
  For 4-dimensional Brownian motion, we show that L\'evyGAN exhibits state-of-the-art performance across several metrics which measure both the joint and marginal distributions. We conclude with a numerical experiment on the log-Heston model, a popular SDE in mathematical finance, demonstrating that high-quality synthetic L\'evy area can lead to high order weak convergence and variance reduction when using multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation engines suggest content, products, or services to the user by using machine learning algorithms. This paper proposes a content-based recommendation engine that provides personalized video suggestions based on users' previous interactions and preferences. The engine uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) text vectorization technique to evaluate the relevance of words in video descriptions, followed by the computation of cosine similarity between content items to determine their degree of similarity. The system's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of content-based filtering in delivering relevant and personalized video recommendations to users. This approach can enhance user engagement on video streaming platforms and reduce search time, providing a more intuitive, preference-based viewing experience.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resided at the intersection of multi-fidelity optimization (MFO) and Bayesian optimization (BO), MF BO has found a niche in solving expensive engineering design optimization problems, thanks to its advantages in incorporating physical and mathematical understandings of the problems, saving resources, addressing exploitation-exploration trade-off, considering uncertainty, and processing parallel computing. The increasing number of works dedicated to MF BO suggests the need for a comprehensive review of this advanced optimization technique. In this paper, we survey recent developments of two essential ingredients of MF BO: Gaussian process (GP) based MF surrogates and acquisition functions. We first categorize the existing MF modeling methods and MFO strategies to locate MF BO in a large family of surrogate-based optimization and MFO algorithms. We then exploit the common properties shared between the methods from each ingredient of MF BO to describe important GP-based MF surrogate models and review various acquisition functions. By doing so, we expect to provide a structured understanding of MF BO. Finally, we attempt to reveal important aspects that require further research for applications of MF BO in solving intricate yet important design optimization problems, including constrained optimization, high-dimensional optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and multi-objective optimization.</description>

      <title>Are Ensembles Getting Better all the Time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble methods combine the predictions of several base models. We study whether or not including more models always improves their average performance. This question depends on the kind of ensemble considered, as well as the predictive metric chosen. We focus on situations where all members of the ensemble are a priori expected to perform equally well, which is the case of several popular methods such as random forests or deep ensembles. In this setting, we show that ensembles are getting better all the time if, and only if, the considered loss function is convex. More precisely, in that case, the loss of the ensemble is a decreasing function of the number of models. When the loss function is nonconvex, we show a series of results that can be summarised as: ensembles of good models keep getting better, and ensembles of bad models keep getting worse. To this end, we prove a new result on the monotonicity of tail probabilities that may be of independent interest. We illustrate our results on a medical problem (diagnosing melanomas using neural nets) and a "wisdom of crowds" experiment (guessing the ratings of upcoming movies).</description>

      <title>Distribution-Dependent Rates for Multi-Distribution Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the needs of modeling uncertainty in sensitive machine learning applications, the setup of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) seeks good performance uniformly across a variety of tasks. The recent multi-distribution learning (MDL) framework tackles this objective in a dynamic interaction with the environment, where the learner has sampling access to each target distribution. Drawing inspiration from the field of pure-exploration multi-armed bandits, we provide distribution-dependent guarantees in the MDL regime, that scale with suboptimality gaps and result in superior dependence on the sample size when compared to the existing distribution-independent analyses. We investigate two non-adaptive strategies, uniform and non-uniform exploration, and present non-asymptotic regret bounds using novel tools from empirical process theory. Furthermore, we devise an adaptive optimistic algorithm, LCB-DR, that showcases enhanced dependence on the gaps, mirroring the contrast between uniform and optimistic allocation in the multi-armed bandit literature. We also conduct a small synthetic experiment illustrating the comparative strengths of each strategy.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Descent for Nonparametric Additive Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00691v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an iterative algorithm for training nonparametric additive models that enjoys favorable memory storage and computational requirements. The algorithm can be viewed as the functional counterpart of stochastic gradient descent, applied to the coefficients of a truncated basis expansion of the component functions. We show that the resulting estimator satisfies an oracle inequality that allows for model mis-specification. In the well-specified setting, by choosing the learning rate carefully across three distinct stages of training, we demonstrate that its risk is minimax optimal in terms of the dependence on both the dimensionality of the data and the size of the training sample. Unlike past work, we also provide polynomial convergence rates even when the covariates do not have full support on their domain.</description>

      <title>FEDSTR: Money-In AI-Out | A Decentralized Marketplace for Federated Learning and LLM Training on the NOSTR Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NOSTR is a communication protocol for the social web, based on the w3c websockets standard. Although it is still in its infancy, it is well known as a social media protocol, with thousands of trusted users and multiple user interfaces, offering a unique experience and enormous capabilities. To name a few, the NOSTR applications include but are not limited to direct messaging, file sharing, audio/video streaming, collaborative writing, blogging and data processing through distributed AI directories. In this work, we propose an approach that builds upon the existing protocol structure with end goal a decentralized marketplace for federated learning and LLM training. In this proposed design there are two parties: on one side there are customers who provide a dataset that they want to use for training an AI model. On the other side, there are service providers, who receive (parts of) the dataset, train the AI model, and for a payment as an exchange, they return the optimized AI model. To demonstrate viability, we present a proof-of-concept implementation over public NOSTR relays. The decentralized and censorship resistant features of the NOSTR enable the possibility of designing a fair and open marketplace for training AI models and LLMs.</description>

      <title>Myopically Verifiable Probabilistic Certificates for Safe Control and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of safety certificates for stochastic systems, with a focus on ensuring long-term safety through fast real-time control. In stochastic environments, set invariance-based methods that restrict the probability of risk events in infinitesimal time intervals may exhibit significant long-term risks due to cumulative uncertainties/risks. On the other hand, reachability-based approaches that account for the long-term future may require prohibitive computation in real-time decision making. To overcome this challenge involving stringent long-term safety vs. computation tradeoffs, we first introduce a novel technique termed `probabilistic invariance'. This technique characterizes the invariance conditions of the probability of interest. When the target probability is defined using long-term trajectories, this technique can be used to design myopic conditions/controllers with assured long-term safe probability. Then, we integrate this technique into safe control and learning. The proposed control methods efficiently assure long-term safety using neural networks or model predictive controllers with short outlook horizons. The proposed learning methods can be used to guarantee long-term safety during and after training. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed techniques in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Linear Bandits with Hidden Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional linear bandits with low-dimensional structure have received considerable attention in recent studies due to their practical significance. The most common structure in the literature is sparsity. However, it may not be available in practice. Symmetry, where the reward is invariant under certain groups of transformations on the set of arms, is another important inductive bias in the high-dimensional case that covers many standard structures, including sparsity. In this work, we study high-dimensional symmetric linear bandits where the symmetry is hidden from the learner, and the correct symmetry needs to be learned in an online setting. We examine the structure of a collection of hidden symmetry and provide a method based on model selection within the collection of low-dimensional subspaces. Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $ O(d_0^{2/3} T^{2/3} \log(d))$, where $d$ is the ambient dimension which is potentially very large, and $d_0$ is the dimension of the true low-dimensional subspace such that $d_0 \ll d$. With an extra assumption on well-separated models, we can further improve the regret to $ O(d_0\sqrt{T\log(d)} )$.</description>

      <title>MM-SpuBench: Towards Better Understanding of Spurious Biases in Multimodal LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spurious bias, a tendency to exploit spurious correlations between superficial input attributes and prediction targets, has revealed a severe robustness pitfall in classical machine learning problems. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which leverage pretrained vision and language models, have recently demonstrated strong capability in joint vision-language understanding. However, both the presence and severity of spurious biases in MLLMs remain poorly understood. In this work, we address this gap by analyzing the spurious biases in the multimodal setting and uncovering the specific inference-time data patterns that can manifest this problem. To support this analysis, we introduce MM-SpuBench, a comprehensive, human-verified benchmark dataset consisting of image-class pairs annotated with core and spurious attributes, grounded in our taxonomy of nine distinct types of spurious correlations. The benchmark is constructed using human-interpretable attribute information to capture a wide range of spurious patterns reflective of real-world knowledge. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary MLLMs with both standard accuracy and the proposed Conditional Generation Likelihood Advantage (CGLA). Our findings highlight the persistence of reliance on spurious correlations and the difficulty of mitigation on our benchmark. We hope this work can inspire new technical strides to mitigate these biases. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/mmbench/MM-SpuBench.</description>

      <title>The Z-Gromov-Wasserstein Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08233v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is a powerful tool for comparing metric measure spaces which has found broad applications in data science and machine learning. Driven by the need to analyze datasets whose objects have increasingly complex structure (such as node and edge-attributed graphs), several variants of GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature. With a view toward establishing a general framework for the theory of GW-like distances, this paper considers a vast generalization of the notion of a metric measure space: for an arbitrary metric space $Z$, we define a $Z$-network to be a measure space endowed with a kernel valued in $Z$. We introduce a method for comparing $Z$-networks by defining a generalization of GW distance, which we refer to as $Z$-Gromov-Wasserstein ($Z$-GW) distance. This construction subsumes many previously known metrics and offers a unified approach to understanding their shared properties. This paper demonstrates that the $Z$-GW distance defines a metric on the space of $Z$-networks which retains desirable properties of $Z$, such as separability, completeness, and geodesicity. Many of these properties were unknown for existing variants of GW distance that fall under our framework. Our focus is on foundational theory, but our results also include computable lower bounds and approximations of the distance which will be useful for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Stock Price Responses to Firm-Level News in Supply Chain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines how positive and negative news about firms are associated with stock prices and whether these associations extend to suppliers and clients linked via supply chain relationships, using large samples of publicly listed firms worldwide and in Japan. News sentiment is measured using FinBERT, a natural language processing model fine-tuned for financial text, and supply chain links are identified from financial statements for global firms and from large-scale firm-level surveys for Japanese firms. We find that stock prices exhibit systematic associations with positive and negative news even before public disclosure. These associations are also observed for suppliers and clients before and after disclosure. In general, post-disclosure associations are larger than pre-disclosure associations, with the difference concentrated around the time of public news disclosure relative to the pre-disclosure period. However, for Japanese firms, the post-disclosure associations for suppliers and clients are smaller than the pre-disclosure associations, in contrast to the pattern observed for firms outside Japan.</description>

      <title>Automatic identification of diagnosis from hospital discharge letters via weakly-supervised Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying patient diagnoses from discharge letters is essential to enable large-scale cohort selection and epidemiological research, but traditional supervised approaches rely on extensive manual annotation, which is often impractical for large textual datasets. In this study, we present a novel weakly-supervised Natural Language Processing pipeline designed to classify Italian discharge letters without requiring manual labelling. After extracting diagnosis-related sentences, the method leverages a transformer-based model with an additional pre-training on Italian medical documents to generate semantic embeddings. A two-level clustering procedure is applied to these embeddings, and the resulting clusters are mapped to the diseases of interest to derive weak labels for a subset of data, eventually used to train a transformer-based classifier. We evaluate the approach on a real-world case study on bronchiolitis in a corpus of 33,176 Italian discharge letters of children admitted to 44 emergency rooms or hospitals in the Veneto Region between 2017 and 2020. The pipeline achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 77.68% ($\pm 4.30\%)$ and an F1-score of 78.14% ($\pm 4.89\%$) against manual annotations. Its performance surpasses other unsupervised methods and approaches fully supervised models, maintaining robustness to cluster selection and promising generalizability across different disease types. It allows saving approximately 3 minutes of expert time per discharge letter, resulting in more than 1,500 hours for a dataset like ours. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a weakly-supervised strategy for identifying diagnoses from Italian discharge letters. The pipeline achieves strong performance, is adaptable to various diseases, and offers a scalable solution for clinical text classification, reducing the need for manual annotation while maintaining reliable accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Oracle Complexity of Simplex-based Matrix Games: Linear Separability and Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of solving matrix games of the form $\max_{\mathbf{w}\in\mathcal{W}}\min_{\mathbf{p}\in\Delta}\mathbf{p}^{\top}A\mathbf{w}$, where $A$ is some matrix and $\Delta$ is the probability simplex. This problem encapsulates canonical tasks such as finding a linear separator and computing Nash equilibria in zero-sum games. However, perhaps surprisingly, its inherent complexity (as formalized in the standard framework of oracle complexity [Nemirovski and Yudin, 1983]) is not well-understood. In this work, we first identify different oracle models which are implicitly used by prior algorithms, amounting to multiplying the matrix $A$ by a vector from either one or both sides. We then prove complexity lower bounds for algorithms under both access models, which in particular imply a separation between them. Specifically, we start by showing that algorithms for linear separability based on one-sided multiplications must require $\Omega(\gamma_A^{-2})$ iterations, where $\gamma_A$ is the margin, as matched by the Perceptron algorithm. We then prove that accelerated algorithms for this task, which utilize multiplications from both sides, must require $\tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{A}^{-2/3})$ iterations, establishing the first oracle complexity barrier for such algorithms. Finally, by adapting our lower bound to $\ell_1$ geometry, we prove that computing an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ iterations, which is an exponential improvement over the previously best-known lower bound due to Hadiji et al. [2024].</description>

      <title>A Particle Algorithm for Mean-Field Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20385v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational inference is a fast and scalable alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo and has been widely applied to posterior inference tasks in statistics and machine learning. A traditional approach for implementing mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI), which relies crucially on parametric assumptions on complete conditionals. We introduce a novel particle-based algorithm for MFVI, named PArticle VI (PAVI), for nonparametric mean-field approximation. We obtain non-asymptotic error bounds for our algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end guarantee for particle-based MFVI.</description>

      <title>NeuroPMD: Neural Fields for Density Estimation on Product Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel deep neural network methodology for density estimation on product Riemannian manifold domains. In our approach, the network directly parameterizes the unknown density function and is trained using a penalized maximum likelihood framework, with a penalty term formed using manifold differential operators. The network architecture and estimation algorithm are carefully designed to handle the challenges of high-dimensional product manifold domains, effectively mitigating the curse of dimensionality that limits traditional kernel and basis expansion estimators, as well as overcoming the convergence issues encountered by non-specialized neural network methods. Extensive simulations and a real-world application to brain structural connectivity data highlight the clear advantages of our method over the competing alternatives.</description>

      <title>coverforest: Conformal Predictions with Random Forest in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a framework for uncertainty quantification, specifically in the forms of prediction intervals and sets with distribution-free guaranteed coverage. While recent cross-conformal techniques such as CV+ and Jackknife+-after-bootstrap achieve better data efficiency than traditional split conformal methods, they incur substantial computational costs due to required pairwise comparisons between training and test samples' out-of-bag scores. Observing that these methods naturally extend from ensemble models, particularly random forests, we leverage existing optimized random forest implementations to enable efficient cross-conformal predictions.
  We present coverforest, a Python package that implements efficient conformal prediction methods specifically optimized for random forests. coverforest supports both regression and classification tasks through various conformal prediction methods, including split conformal, CV+, Jackknife+-after-bootstrap, and adaptive prediction sets. Our package leverages parallel computing and Cython optimizations to speed up out-of-bag calculations. Our experiments demonstrate that coverforest's predictions achieve the desired level of coverage. In addition, its training and prediction times can be faster than an existing implementation by 2--9 times. The source code for the coverforest is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/donlap/coverforest.</description>

      <title>MaxInfo: A Training-Free Key-Frame Selection Method Using Maximum Volume for Enhanced Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) often rely on uniform frame sampling for video understanding, but this approach frequently fails to capture critical information due to frame redundancy and variations in video content. We propose MaxInfo, the first training-free method based on the maximum volume principle, which is available in Fast and Slow versions and a Chunk-based version that selects and retains the most representative frames from a video. By maximizing the geometric volume formed by selected embeddings, MaxInfo ensures that the chosen frames cover the most informative regions of the embedding space, effectively reducing redundancy while preserving diversity. This method enhances the quality of input representations and improves long video comprehension performance across benchmarks. For instance, MaxInfo achieves a 3.28% improvement on LongVideoBench and a 6.4% improvement on EgoSchema for LLaVA-Video-7B. Moreover, MaxInfo boosts LongVideoBench performance by 3.47% on LLaVA-Video-72B and 3.44% on MiniCPM4.5. The approach is simple to implement and works with existing VLLMs without the need for additional training and very lower latency, making it a practical and effective alternative to traditional uniform sampling methods.

      <title>Large Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Languages: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we systematically analyze techniques used to adapt large multimodal models (LMMs) for low-resource (LR) languages, examining approaches ranging from visual enhancement and data creation to cross-modal transfer and fusion strategies. Through a comprehensive analysis of 117 studies across 96 LR languages, we identify key patterns in how researchers tackle the challenges of limited data and computational resources. We categorize works into resource-oriented and method-oriented contributions, further dividing contributions into relevant sub-categories. We compare method-oriented contributions in terms of performance and efficiency, discussing benefits and limitations of representative studies. We find that visual information often serves as a crucial bridge for improving model performance in LR settings, though significant challenges remain in areas such as hallucination mitigation and computational efficiency. In summary, we provide researchers with a clear understanding of current approaches and remaining challenges in making LMMs more accessible to speakers of LR (understudied) languages. We complement our survey with an open-source repository available at: https://github.com/marianlupascu/LMM4LRL-Survey.</description>

      <title>Concentration Inequalities for Stochastic Optimization of Unbounded Objective Functions with Application to Denoising Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive novel concentration inequalities that bound the statistical error for a large class of stochastic optimization problems, focusing on the case of unbounded objective functions. Our derivations utilize the following key tools: 1) A new form of McDiarmid's inequality that is based on sample-dependent one-component mean-difference bounds and which leads to a novel uniform law of large numbers result for unbounded functions. 2) A new Rademacher complexity bound for families of functions that satisfy an appropriate sample-dependent Lipschitz property, which allows for application to a large class of distributions with unbounded support. As an application of these results, we derive statistical error bounds for denoising score matching (DSM), an application that inherently requires one to consider unbounded objective functions and distributions with unbounded support, even in cases where the data distribution has bounded support. In addition, our results quantify the benefit of sample-reuse in algorithms that employ easily-sampled auxiliary random variables in addition to the training data, e.g., as in DSM, which uses auxiliary Gaussian random variables.</description>

      <title>CAML: Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal learning has emerged as a key technique for improving performance across domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and reasoning. However, in certain scenarios, particularly in resource-constrained environments, some modalities available during training may be absent during inference. While existing frameworks effectively utilize multiple data sources during training and enable inference with reduced modalities, they are primarily designed for single-agent settings. This poses a critical limitation in dynamic environments such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), where incomplete data coverage can lead to decision-making blind spots. Conversely, some works explore multi-agent collaboration but without addressing missing modality at test time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning (CAML), a novel multi-modal multi-agent framework that enables agents to collaborate and share multi-modal data during training, while allowing inference with reduced modalities during testing. Experimental results in collaborative decision-making for CAV in accident-prone scenarios demonstrate that CAML achieves up to a 58.1% improvement in accident detection. Additionally, we validate CAML on real-world aerial-ground robot data for collaborative semantic segmentation, achieving up to a 10.6% improvement in mIoU.</description>

      <title>Simple Self Organizing Map with Visual Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various vision tasks. However, they tend to underperform on smaller datasets due to their inherent lack of inductive biases. Current approaches address this limitation implicitly-often by pairing ViTs with pretext tasks or by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to strengthen the prior. In contrast, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a widely adopted self-supervised framework, are inherently structured to preserve topology and spatial organization, making them a promising candidate to directly address the limitations of ViTs in limited or small training datasets. Despite this potential, equipping SOMs with modern deep learning architectures remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a novel exploration on how Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can empower each other, aiming to bridge this critical research gap. Our findings demonstrate that these architectures can synergistically enhance each other, leading to significantly improved performance in both unsupervised and supervised tasks.

      <title>Redefining non-IID Data in Federated Learning for Computer Vision Tasks: Migrating from Labels to Embeddings for Task-Specific Data Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14553v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as one of the prominent paradigms for distributed machine learning (ML). However, it is well-established that its performance can degrade significantly under non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data distributions across clients. To study this effect, the existing works predominantly emulate data heterogeneity by imposing label distribution skew across clients. In this paper, we show that label distribution skew fails to fully capture the data heterogeneity in computer vision tasks beyond classification, exposing an overlooked gap in the literature. Motivated by this, by utilizing pre-trained deep neural networks to extract task-specific data embeddings, we define task-specific data heterogeneity through the lens of each vision task and introduce a new level of data heterogeneity called embedding-based data heterogeneity. Our methodology involves clustering data points based on embeddings and distributing them among clients using the Dirichlet distribution. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate the performance of different FL methods under our revamped notion of data heterogeneity, introducing new benchmark performance measures to the literature. For instance, across seven representative computer vision tasks, our embedding-based heterogeneity formulation leads to up to around 60% increase in the observed loss under FedAvg, indicating that it more accurately exposes the performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity. We further unveil a series of open research directions that can be pursued.</description>

      <title>Neurosymbolic Association Rule Mining from Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19354v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of mining patterns among data features in the form of logical rules, with applications across a myriad of domains. However, high-dimensional datasets often result in an excessive number of rules, increasing execution time and negatively impacting downstream task performance. Managing this rule explosion remains a central challenge in ARM research. To address this, we introduce Aerial+, a novel neurosymbolic ARM method. Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural representation of the data, capturing associations between features. It extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage. When integrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+ significantly reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Discovery and inference beyond linearity by integrating Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for hypothesis-free discovery of risk and protective factors in healthcare studies. ML is strong at discovering nonlinearities and interactions, but this power is compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although Shapley values provide local measures of features' effects, valid uncertainty quantification for these effects is typically lacking, thus precluding statistical inference. We propose RuleSHAP, a framework that addresses this limitation by combining a dedicated Bayesian sparse regression model with a new tree-based rule generator and Shapley value attribution. RuleSHAP provides detection of nonlinear and interaction effects with uncertainty quantification at the individual level. We derive an efficient formula for computing marginal Shapley values within this framework. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on simulated data. Finally, we apply RuleSHAP to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.</description>

      <title>Optimization over Trained (and Sparse) Neural Networks: A Surrogate within a Surrogate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In constraint learning, we use a neural network as a surrogate for part of the constraints or of the objective function of an optimization model. However, the tractability of the resulting model is heavily influenced by the size of the neural network used as a surrogate. One way to obtain a more tractable surrogate is by pruning the neural network first. In this work, we consider how to approach the setting in which the neural network is actually a given: how can we solve an optimization model embedding a large and predetermined neural network? We propose surrogating the neural network itself by pruning it, which leads to a sparse and more tractable optimization model, for which we hope to still obtain good solutions with respect to the original neural network. For network verification and function maximization models, that indeed leads to better solutions within a time limit, especially -- and surprisingly -- if we skip the standard retraining step known as finetuning. Hence, a pruned network with worse inference for lack of finetuning can be a better surrogate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new affine invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers that are easy to construct and improve upon existing methods, especially for high-dimensional problems. We first propose a simple derivative-free side move sampler that improves upon popular samplers in the \texttt{emcee} package by generating more effective proposal directions. We then develop a class of derivative-based affine invariant ensemble Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers based on antisymmetric preconditioning using complementary ensembles, which outperform standard, non-affine-invariant HMC when sampling highly anisotropic distributions. We provide asymptotic scaling analysis for high-dimensional Gaussian targets to further elucidate the properties of these affine invariant ensemble samplers. In particular, with derivative information, the affine invariant ensemble HMC can scale much better with dimension compared to derivative-free ensemble samplers.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Hyper-Parameter Optimization Methods for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) configurations for specific tasks is a complex and resource-intensive challenge. Motivated by this challenge, frameworks for RAG hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) have recently emerged, yet their effectiveness has not been rigorously benchmarked. To fill this gap, we present a comprehensive study involving five HPO algorithms over five datasets from diverse domains, including a newly curated real-world product documentation dataset. Our study explores the largest RAG HPO search space to date that includes full grid-search evaluations, and uses three evaluation metrics as optimization targets. Analysis of the results shows that RAG HPO can be done efficiently, either greedily or with random search, and that it significantly boosts RAG performance for all datasets. For greedy HPO approaches, we show that optimizing model selection first is preferable to the common practice of following the RAG pipeline order during optimization.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Understand Collaborative Signals? Diagnosis and Repair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaborative information from user-item interactions is a fundamental source of signal in successful recommender systems. Recently, researchers have attempted to incorporate this knowledge into large language model-based recommender approaches (LLMRec) to enhance their performance. However, there has been little fundamental analysis of whether LLMs can effectively reason over collaborative information. In this paper, we analyze the ability of LLMs to reason about collaborative information in recommendation tasks, comparing their performance to traditional matrix factorization (MF) models. We propose a simple and effective method to improve LLMs' reasoning capabilities using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over the user-item interaction matrix with four different prompting strategies. Our results show that the LLM outperforms the MF model whenever we provide relevant information in a clear and easy-to-follow format, and prompt the LLM to reason based on it. We observe that with this strategy, in almost all cases, the more information we provide, the better the LLM performs.</description>

      <title>Contextual Integrity in LLMs via Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04245v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds, ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$ examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families. Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

      <title>MuRating: A High Quality Data Selecting Approach to Multilingual Large Language Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.</description>

      <title>PERK: Long-Context Reasoning as Parameter-Efficient Test-Time Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive, preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline, achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models (GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Deep Learning-Based Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems on Resource-Limited Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless technologies such as 6G aim to meet demanding requirements such as ultra-high data rates, low latency, and enhanced connectivity. Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However, realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information (CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume, escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in XL-MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-step retrieval and reasoning improves radiology question answering with large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00743v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose radiology Retrieval and Reasoning (RaR), a multi-step retrieval and reasoning framework designed to improve diagnostic accuracy, factual consistency, and clinical reliability of LLMs in radiology question answering. We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to &gt;670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. To assess generalizability, we additionally tested on an unseen internal dataset of 65 real-world radiology board examination questions. RaR significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting and conventional online RAG. The greatest gains occurred in small-scale models, while very large models (&gt;200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (&lt;2% improvement). Additionally, RaR retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from RaR (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of RaR to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility. All datasets, code, and the full RaR framework are publicly available to support open research and clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Learning quadratic neural networks in high dimensions: SGD dynamics and scaling laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the optimization and sample complexity of gradient-based training of a two-layer neural network with quadratic activation function in the high-dimensional regime, where the data is generated as $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) \propto \sum_{j=1}^{r}\lambda_j \sigma\left(\langle \boldsymbol{\theta_j}, \boldsymbol{x}\rangle\right), \boldsymbol{x} \sim N(0,\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, $\sigma$ is the 2nd Hermite polynomial, and $\lbrace\boldsymbol{\theta}_j \rbrace_{j=1}^{r} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal directions. We consider the extensive-width regime $r \asymp d^\beta$ for $\beta \in [0, 1)$, and assume a power-law decay on the (non-negative) second-layer coefficients $\lambda_j\asymp j^{-\alpha}$ for $\alpha \geq 0$. We present a sharp analysis of the SGD dynamics in the feature learning regime, for both the population limit and the finite-sample (online) discretization, and derive scaling laws for the prediction risk that highlight the power-law dependencies on the optimization time, sample size, and model width. Our analysis combines a precise characterization of the associated matrix Riccati differential equation with novel matrix monotonicity arguments to establish convergence guarantees for the infinite-dimensional effective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Spatial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13142v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence (SI). We thus propose EASI for holistic Evaluation of multimodAl LLMs on Spatial Intelligence. EASI conceptualizes a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a growing collection of newly curated ones, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models. In this report, we conduct the study across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in SI, yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail the most advanced multimodal models. EASI is an ongoing community effort: we have open-sourced the EASI codebase that provides a one-stop and reproducible solution with standardized interfaces, integrated protocols and prompts that significantly reduce the friction of configuring and running multiple benchmarks; we have also launched an accompanying EASI leaderboard to provide a continually updated snapshot of model performance across the full SI spectrum, accelerating collective progress toward robust SI.</description>

      <title>MedQARo: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Medical Question Answering in Romanian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce MedQARo, the first large-scale medical QA benchmark in Romanian, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 105,880 QA pairs related to cancer patients from two medical centers. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,242 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. MedQARo is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 3,000 work hours to generate the QA pairs. Our benchmark contains both in-domain and cross-domain (cross-center and cross-cancer) test collections, enabling a precise assessment of generalization capabilities. We experiment with four open-source LLMs from distinct families of models on MedQARo. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. We also evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs exposed only through APIs, namely GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform zero-shot models, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on MedQARo. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/MedQARo.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-Guided Design of Interpolation Schedules in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the design of interpolation schedules in the stochastic interpolants framework for flow and diffusion-based generative models. We show that while all scalar interpolation schedules achieve identical statistical efficiency under Kullback-Leibler divergence in path space after optimal diffusion coefficient tuning, their numerical efficiency can differ substantially. This motivates focusing on numerical properties of the resulting drift fields rather than purely statistical criteria for schedule design. We propose averaged squared Lipschitzness minimization as a principled criterion for numerical optimization, providing an alternative to kinetic energy minimization used in optimal transport approaches. A transfer formula is derived that enables conversion between different schedules at inference time without retraining neural networks. For Gaussian distributions, the optimized schedules achieve exponential improvements in Lipschitz constants over standard linear schedules, while for Gaussian mixtures, they reduce mode collapse in few-step sampling. We also validate our approach on high-dimensional invariant distributions from stochastic Allen-Cahn equations and Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrating robust performance improvements across resolutions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Learning in Deep Asymmetric Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate recurrent neural networks with asymmetric interactions and demonstrate that the inclusion of self-couplings or sparse excitatory inter-module connections leads to the emergence of a densely connected manifold of dynamically accessible stable configurations. This representation manifold is exponentially large in system size and is reachable through simple local dynamics, despite constituting a subdominant subset of the global configuration space. We further show that learning can be implemented directly on this structure via a fully local, gradient-free mechanism that selectively stabilizes a single task-relevant network configuration. Unlike error-driven or contrastive learning schemes, this approach does not require explicit comparisons between network states obtained with and without output supervision. Instead, transient supervisory signals bias the dynamics toward the representation manifold, after which local plasticity consolidates the attained configuration, effectively shaping the latent representation space. Numerical evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks indicate performance comparable to that of multilayer perceptrons trained using backpropagation. More generally, these results suggest that the dynamical accessibility of fixed points and the stabilization of internal network dynamics constitute viable alternative principles for learning in recurrent systems, with conceptual links to statistical physics and potential implications for biologically motivated and neuromorphic computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Audio Super-Resolution with Latent Bridge Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio super-resolution (SR), i.e., upsampling the low-resolution (LR) waveform to the high-resolution (HR) version, has recently been explored with diffusion and bridge models, while previous methods often suffer from sub-optimal upsampling quality due to their uninformative generation prior. Towards high-quality audio super-resolution, we present a new system with latent bridge models (LBMs), where we compress the audio waveform into a continuous latent space and design an LBM to enable a latent-to-latent generation process that naturally matches the LR-toHR upsampling process, thereby fully exploiting the instructive prior information contained in the LR waveform. To further enhance the training results despite the limited availability of HR samples, we introduce frequency-aware LBMs, where the prior and target frequency are taken as model input, enabling LBMs to explicitly learn an any-to-any upsampling process at the training stage. Furthermore, we design cascaded LBMs and present two prior augmentation strategies, where we make the first attempt to unlock the audio upsampling beyond 48 kHz and empower a seamless cascaded SR process, providing higher flexibility for audio post-production. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated on the VCTK, ESC-50, Song-Describer benchmark datasets and two internal testsets demonstrate that we achieve state-of-the-art objective and perceptual quality for any-to-48kHz SR across speech, audio, and music signals, as well as setting the first record for any-to-192kHz audio SR.

      <title>Distributed Information Bottleneck Theory for Multi-Modal Task-Aware Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication shifts the focus from bit-level accuracy to task-relevant semantic delivery, enabling efficient and intelligent communication for next-generation networks. However, existing multi-modal solutions often process all available data modalities indiscriminately, ignoring that their contributions to downstream tasks are often unequal. This not only leads to severe resource inefficiency but also degrades task inference performance due to irrelevant or redundant information. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel task-aware distributed information bottleneck (TADIB) framework, which quantifies the contribution of any set of modalities to given tasks. Based on this theoretical framework, we design a practical coding scheme that intelligently selects and compresses only the most task-relevant modalities at the transmitter. To find the optimal selection and the codecs in the network, we adopt the probabilistic relaxation of discrete selection, enabling distributed encoders to make coordinated decisions with score function estimation and common randomness. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our solution matches or surpasses the inference quality of full-modal baselines while significantly reducing communication and computational costs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion-Based Sampling with Molecular Collective Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based samplers learn to sample complex, high-dimensional distributions using energies or log densities alone, without training data. Yet, they remain impractical for molecular sampling because they are often slower than molecular dynamics and miss thermodynamically relevant modes. Inspired by enhanced sampling, we encourage exploration by introducing a sequential bias along bespoke, information-rich, low-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates known as collective variables (CVs). We introduce a repulsive potential centered on the CVs from recent samples, which pushes future samples towards novel CV regions and effectively increases the temperature in the projected space. Our resulting method improves efficiency, mode discovery, enables the estimation of free energy differences, and retains independent sampling from the approximate Boltzmann distribution via reweighting by the bias. On standard peptide conformational sampling benchmarks, the method recovers diverse conformational states and accurate free energy profiles. We are the first to demonstrate reactive sampling using a diffusion-based sampler, capturing bond breaking and formation with universal interatomic potentials at near-first-principles accuracy. The approach resolves reactive energy landscapes at a fraction of the wall-clock time of standard sampling methods, advancing diffusion-based sampling towards practical use in molecular sciences.</description>

      <title>When Intelligence Fails: An Empirical Study on Why LLMs Struggle with Password Cracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language understanding and generation have sparked interest in their potential for cybersecurity applications, including password guessing. In this study, we conduct an empirical investigation into the efficacy of pre-trained LLMs for password cracking using synthetic user profiles. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art open-source LLMs such as TinyLLaMA, Falcon-RW-1B, and Flan-T5 by prompting them to generate plausible passwords based on structured user attributes (e.g., name, birthdate, hobbies). Our results, measured using Hit@1, Hit@5, and Hit@10 metrics under both plaintext and SHA-256 hash comparisons, reveal consistently poor performance, with all models achieving less than 1.5% accuracy at Hit@10. In contrast, traditional rule-based and combinator-based cracking methods demonstrate significantly higher success rates. Through detailed analysis and visualization, we identify key limitations in the generative reasoning of LLMs when applied to the domain-specific task of password guessing. Our findings suggest that, despite their linguistic prowess, current LLMs lack the domain adaptation and memorization capabilities required for effective password inference, especially in the absence of supervised fine-tuning on leaked password datasets. This study provides critical insights into the limitations of LLMs in adversarial contexts and lays the groundwork for future efforts in secure, privacy-preserving, and robust password modeling.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Submodular Maximization Under Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function with access to a noisy value oracle for the function instead of an exact value oracle. Similar to prior work, we assume that the noisy oracle is persistent in that multiple calls to the oracle for a specific set always return the same value. In this model, Hassidim and Singer (2017) design a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint, and Huang et al (2022) design a $(1-1/e)/2$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to any arbitrary matroid constraint. In this paper, we design a meta-algorithm that allows us to take any "robust" algorithm for exact submodular maximization as a black box and transform it into an algorithm for the noisy setting while retaining the approximation guarantee. By using the meta-algorithm with the measured continuous greedy algorithm, we obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation (resp. $1/e$-approximation) for monotone (resp. non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint under noise. Furthermore, by using the meta-algorithm with the double greedy algorithm, we obtain a $1/2$-approximation for unconstrained (non-monotone) submodular maximization under noise.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Convolution and Vision Transformer NAS Search Space for TinyML Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs, they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction. Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.</description>

      <title>Toward Autonomous Engineering Design: A Knowledge-Guided Multi-Agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains, leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this, we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature. The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature attribution methods typically provide minimal sufficient evidence justifying a model decision. However, in many applications, such as compliance and cataloging, the full set of contributing features must be identified: complete evidence. We present a case study using existing language models and a medical dataset which contains human-annotated complete evidence. Our findings show that an ensemble approach, aggregating evidence from several models, improves evidence recall over individual models. We examine different ensemble sizes, the effect of evidence-guided training, and provide qualitative insights.</description>

      <title>Training Language Models to Explain Their Own Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can language models (LMs) learn to faithfully describe their internal computations? Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.

      <title>Scaling Spatial Intelligence with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>ForensicFlow: A Tri-Modal Adaptive Network for Robust Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern deepfakes evade detection by leaving subtle, domain-speci c artifacts that single branch networks miss. ForensicFlow addresses this by fusing evidence across three forensic dimensions: global visual inconsistencies (via ConvNeXt-tiny), ne-grained texture anomalies (via Swin Transformer-tiny), and spectral noise patterns (via CNN with channel attention). Our attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive fusion weights each branch according to forgery type. Trained on CelebDF(v2) with Focal Loss, the model achieves AUC 0.9752, F1 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208 out performing single-stream detectors. Ablation studies con rm branch synergy, and Grad-CAM visualizations validate focus on genuine manipulation regions (e.g., facial boundaries). This multi-domain fusion strategy establishes robustness against increasingly sophisticated forgeries.</description>

      <title>Cross-embodied Co-design for Dexterous Hands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is limited by both control and design, without consensus as to what makes manipulators best for performing dexterous tasks. This raises a fundamental challenge: how should we design and control robot manipulators that are optimized for dexterity? We present a co-design framework that learns task-specific hand morphology and complementary dexterous control policies. The framework supports 1) an expansive morphology search space including joint, finger, and palm generation, 2) scalable evaluation across the wide design space via morphology-conditioned cross-embodied control, and 3) real-world fabrication with accessible components. We evaluate the approach across multiple dexterous tasks, including in-hand rotation with simulation and real deployment. Our framework enables an end-to-end pipeline that can design, train, fabricate, and deploy a new robotic hand in under 24 hours. The full framework will be open-sourced and available on our website: https://an-axolotl.github.io/co-design-for-dexterity.github.io/</description>

      <title>On measuring grounding and generalizing grounding problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symbol grounding problem asks how tokens like cat can be about cats, as opposed to mere shapes manipulated in a calculus. We recast grounding from a binary judgment into an audit across desiderata, each indexed by an evaluation tuple (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution): authenticity (mechanisms reside inside the agent and, for strong claims, were acquired through learning or evolution); preservation (atomic meanings remain intact); faithfulness, both correlational (realized meanings match intended ones) and etiological (internal mechanisms causally contribute to success); robustness (graceful degradation under declared perturbations); compositionality (the whole is built systematically from the parts). We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition. By operationalizing a philosophical inquiry about representation, we equip philosophers of science, computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians with a common language and technical framework for systematic investigation of grounding and meaning.</description>

      <title>Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding for Error Span Detection in Reference-Free Automatic Machine Translation Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error Span Detection (ESD) extends automatic machine translation (MT) evaluation by localizing translation errors and labeling their severity. Current generative ESD methods typically use Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) decoding, assuming that the model-estimated probabilities are perfectly correlated with similarity to the human annotation, but we often observe higher likelihood assigned to an incorrect annotation than to the human one. We instead apply Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to generative ESD. We use a sentence- or span-level similarity function for MBR decoding, which selects candidate hypotheses based on their approximate similarity to the human annotation. Experimental results on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task show that MBR decoding significantly improves span-level performance and generally matches or outperforms MAP at the system and sentence levels. To reduce the computational cost of MBR decoding, we further distill its decisions into a model decoded via greedy search, removing the inference-time latency bottleneck.</description>

      <title>Terrain Diffusion: A Diffusion-Based Successor to Perlin Noise in Infinite, Real-Time Terrain Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For decades, procedural worlds have been built on procedural noise functions such as Perlin noise, which are fast and infinite, yet fundamentally limited in realism and large-scale coherence. We introduce Terrain Diffusion, a generative framework that bridges the fidelity of diffusion models with the properties that made procedural noise indispensable: seamless infinite extent, seed-consistency, and constant-time random access. At its core is InfiniteDiffusion, a novel algorithm for infinite generation that reformulates standard diffusion sampling for unbounded domains. While noise functions remain near-instant, our framework outpaces orbital velocity by 9 times on a consumer GPU, enabling realistic terrain generation at interactive rates. We integrate a hierarchical stack of diffusion models to couple planetary context with local detail, a compact Laplacian encoding to stabilize outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges, and an open-source infinite-tensor framework for constant-memory manipulation of unbounded tensors. Together, these components position diffusion models as a practical, scalable foundation for the next generation of infinite virtual worlds.</description>

Abstract: Practically everything computers do is better, faster, and more power-efficient than the brain. For example, a calculator performs numerical computations more energy-efficiently than any human. Yet modern AI models are a thousand times less efficient than the brain. These models rely on larger and larger artificial neural networks (ANNs) to boost their encoding capacity, requiring GPUs to perform large-scale matrix multiplications. In contrast, the brain's spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit factorially explosive encoding capacity and compute through the polychronization of spikes rather than explicit matrix-vector products, resulting in lower energy requirements. This manifesto proposes a paradigm for framing popular AI models in terms of spiking networks and polychronization, and for interpreting spiking activity as nature's way of implementing look-up tables. This suggests a path toward converting AI models into a novel class of architectures with much smaller size yet combinatorially large encoding capacity, offering the promise of a thousandfold improvement in performance.

      <title>DiRe: Diversity-promoting Regularization for Dataset Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Dataset Condensation, the goal is to synthesize a small dataset that replicates the training utility of a large original dataset. Existing condensation methods synthesize datasets with significant redundancy, so there is a dire need to reduce redundancy and improve the diversity of the synthesized datasets. To tackle this, we propose an intuitive Diversity Regularizer (DiRe) composed of cosine similarity and Euclidean distance, which can be applied off-the-shelf to various state-of-the-art condensation methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the addition of our regularizer improves state-of-the-art condensation methods on various benchmark datasets from CIFAR-10 to ImageNet-1K with respect to generalization and diversity metrics.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Deep Learning for Stock Returns: A Consensus-Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Consensus-Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model (CB-APM), a framework that reconciles the predictive power of deep learning with the structural transparency of traditional finance. By embedding aggregate analyst consensus as a structural "bottleneck", the model treats professional beliefs as a sufficient statistic for the market's high-dimensional information set. We document a striking "interpretability-accuracy amplification effect" for annual horizons, the structural constraint acts as an endogenous regularizer that significantly improves out-of-sample R2 over unconstrained benchmarks. Portfolios sorted on CB-APM forecasts exhibit a strong monotonic return gradient, delivering an annualized Sharpe ratio of 1.44 and robust performance across macroeconomic regimes. Furthermore, pricing diagnostics reveal that the learned consensus captures priced variation only partially spanned by canonical factor models, identifying structured risk heterogeneity that standard linear models systematically miss. Our results suggest that anchoring machine intelligence to human-expert belief formation is not merely a tool for transparency, but a catalyst for uncovering new dimensions of belief-driven risk premiums.</description>

      <title>On The Hidden Biases of Flow Matching Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flow matching (FM) samplers via the lens of empirical flow matching. Although population FM may produce gradient-field velocities resembling optimal transport (OT), we show that the empirical FM minimizer is generally not a gradient field, even when each conditional flow is. Consequently, empirical FM is intrinsically not OT-optimal in the Benamou-Brenier sense. In view of this, we analyze the kinetic energy of generated samples. With Gaussian sources, both instantaneous and integrated kinetic energies exhibit exponential concentration, while heavy-tailed sources lead to polynomial tails. These behaviors are governed primarily by the choice of source distribution rather than the data. Overall, these notes provide a concise mathematical account of the structural and energetic biases arising in empirical FM.</description>

      <title>PolaRiS: Scalable Real-to-Sim Evaluations for Generalist Robot Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.</description>

      <title>GIMLET: Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a data-driven framework for discovering constitutive relations in models of fluid flow and scalar transport. Under the assumption that velocity and/or scalar fields are measured, our approach infers unknown closure terms in the governing equations as neural networks. The target to be discovered is the constitutive relations only, while the temporal derivative, convective transport terms, and pressure-gradient term in the governing equations are prescribed. The formulation is rooted in a variational principle from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where the dynamics is defined by a free-energy functional and a dissipation functional. The unknown constitutive terms arise as functional derivatives of these functionals with respect to the state variables. To enable a flexible and structured model discovery, the free-energy and dissipation functionals are parameterized using neural networks, while their functional derivatives are obtained via automatic differentiation. This construction enforces thermodynamic consistency by design, guaranteeing monotonic decay of the total free energy and non-negative entropy production. The resulting method, termed GIMLET (Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics), avoids reliance on a predefined library of candidate functions, unlike sparse regression or symbolic identification approaches. The learned models are generalizable in that functionals identified from one dataset can be transferred to distinct datasets governed by the same underlying equations. Moreover, the inferred free-energy and dissipation functions provide direct physical interpretability of the learned dynamics. The framework is demonstrated on several benchmark systems, including the viscous Burgers equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>AUDRON: A Deep Learning Framework with Fused Acoustic Signatures for Drone Type Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are increasingly used across diverse domains, including logistics, agriculture, surveillance, and defense. While these systems provide numerous benefits, their misuse raises safety and security concerns, making effective detection mechanisms essential. Acoustic sensing offers a low-cost and non-intrusive alternative to vision or radar-based detection, as drone propellers generate distinctive sound patterns. This study introduces AUDRON (AUdio-based Drone Recognition Network), a hybrid deep learning framework for drone sound detection, employing a combination of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms processed with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent layers for temporal modeling, and autoencoder-based representations. Feature-level fusion integrates complementary information before classification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that AUDRON effectively differentiates drone acoustic signatures from background noise, achieving high accuracy while maintaining generalizability across varying conditions. AUDRON achieves 98.51 percent and 97.11 percent accuracy in binary and multiclass classification. The results highlight the advantage of combining multiple feature representations with deep learning for reliable acoustic drone detection, suggesting the framework's potential for deployment in security and surveillance applications where visual or radar sensing may be limited.</description>

      <title>InSPO: Unlocking Intrinsic Self-Reflection for LLM Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become standard for aligning Large Language Models due to their simplicity and offline stability. However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (InSPO), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. InSPO serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.</description>

      <title>Visual Language Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient X/G is not a submanifold of X and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non homeomorphic, discriminative target for example, supervision via labels, cross-instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand and snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.</description>
