      <title>Multimodal AI for Body Fat Estimation: Computer Vision and Anthropometry with DEXA Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking body fat percentage is essential for effective weight management, yet gold-standard methods such as DEXA scans remain expensive and inaccessible for most people. This study evaluates the feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) models as low-cost alternatives using frontal body images and basic anthropometric data. The dataset consists of 535 samples: 253 cases with recorded anthropometric measurements (weight, height, neck, ankle, and wrist) and 282 images obtained via web scraping from Reddit posts with self-reported body fat percentages, including some reported as DEXA-derived by the original posters. Because no public datasets exist for computer-vision-based body fat estimation, this dataset was compiled specifically for this study. Two approaches were developed: (1) ResNet-based image models and (2) regression models using anthropometric measurements. A multimodal fusion framework is also outlined for future expansion once paired datasets become available. The image-based model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.44% and a Coefficient of Determination (R^2) of 0.807. These findings demonstrate that AI-assisted models can offer accessible and low-cost body fat estimates, supporting future consumer applications in health and fitness.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction-Driven Multimodal Representation Learning for Automated Media Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadcast and media organizations increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to automate the labor-intensive processes of content indexing, tagging, and metadata generation. However, existing AI systems typically operate on a single modality-such as video, audio, or text-limiting their understanding of complex, cross-modal relationships in broadcast material. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) that learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data, enabling end-to-end automation of metadata extraction and semantic clustering. The model is trained on the recently introduced LUMA dataset, a fully aligned benchmark of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content. By minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, the MMAE discovers modality-invariant semantic structures without relying on large paired or contrastive datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, indicating that reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as a foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives. These results highlight the potential of reconstruction-driven multimodal learning to enhance automation, searchability, and content management efficiency in modern broadcast workflows.</description>

      <title>BCWildfire: A Long-term Multi-factor Dataset and Deep Learning Benchmark for Boreal Wildfire Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfire risk prediction remains a critical yet challenging task due to the complex interactions among fuel conditions, meteorology, topography, and human activity. Despite growing interest in data-driven approaches, publicly available benchmark datasets that support long-term temporal modeling, large-scale spatial coverage, and multimodal drivers remain scarce. To address this gap, we present a 25-year, daily-resolution wildfire dataset covering 240 million hectares across British Columbia and surrounding regions. The dataset includes 38 covariates, encompassing active fire detections, weather variables, fuel conditions, terrain features, and anthropogenic factors. Using this benchmark, we evaluate a diverse set of time-series forecasting models, including CNN-based, linear-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based architectures. We also investigate effectiveness of position embedding and the relative importance of different fire-driving factors. The dataset and the corresponding code can be found at https://github.com/SynUW/mmFire</description>

      <title>Robustness of Structured Data Extraction from Perspectively Distorted Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction from documents is essential to intelligent informatics, such as digitizing medical records and recognizing road signs. Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks.</description>

      <title>3D Ground Truth Reconstruction from Multi-Camera Annotations Using UKF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D ground truth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous navigation, surveillance, and robotics. This paper introduces a novel method that uses an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to fuse 2D bounding box or pose keypoint ground truth annotations from multiple calibrated cameras into accurate 3D ground truth. By leveraging human-annotated ground-truth 2D, our proposed method, a multi-camera single-object tracking algorithm, transforms 2D image coordinates into robust 3D world coordinates through homography-based projection and UKF-based fusion. Our proposed algorithm processes multi-view data to estimate object positions and shapes while effectively handling challenges such as occlusion. We evaluate our method on the CMC, Wildtrack, and Panoptic datasets, demonstrating high accuracy in 3D localization compared to the available 3D ground truth. Unlike existing approaches that provide only ground-plane information, our method also outputs the full 3D shape of each object. Additionally, the algorithm offers a scalable and fully automatic solution for multi-camera systems using only 2D image annotations.</description>

      <title>Unified Low-Light Traffic Image Enhancement via Multi-Stage Illumination Recovery and Adaptive Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing low-light traffic images is crucial for reliable perception in autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and urban surveillance systems. Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance. The network is trained using self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses, eliminating the need for paired ground-truth images. Experiments on general and traffic-specific datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality. Our approach enhances visibility, preserves structure, and improves downstream perception reliability in real-world low-light traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>HSMix: Hard and Soft Mixing Data Augmentation for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotation or the rarity of some diseases, medical image segmentation is often limited by data scarcity and the resulting overfitting problem. Self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning can mitigate the data scarcity challenge to some extent. However, both of these paradigms are complex and require either hand-crafted pretexts or well-defined pseudo-labels. In contrast, data augmentation represents a relatively simple and straightforward approach to addressing data scarcity issues. It has led to significant improvements in image recognition tasks. However, the effectiveness of local image editing augmentation techniques in the context of segmentation has been less explored. We propose HSMix, a novel approach to local image editing data augmentation involving hard and soft mixing for medical semantic segmentation. In our approach, a hard-augmented image is created by combining homogeneous regions (superpixels) from two source images. A soft mixing method further adjusts the brightness of these composed regions with brightness mixing based on locally aggregated pixel-wise saliency coefficients. The ground-truth segmentation masks of the two source images undergo the same mixing operations to generate the associated masks for the augmented images. Our method fully exploits both the prior contour and saliency information, thus preserving local semantic information in the augmented images while enriching the augmentation space with more diversity. Our method is a plug-and-play solution that is model agnostic and applicable to a range of medical imaging modalities. Extensive experimental evidence has demonstrated its effectiveness in a variety of medical segmentation tasks. The source code is available in https://github.com/DanielaPlusPlus/HSMix.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Multi-Concept Adaptive Blending for High-Fidelity Text-to-Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single image has recently become a significant area of focus within Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods often underperform on complex multi-object scenes due to unintended alterations in both personalized and non-personalized regions. This not only fails to preserve the intended prompt structure but also disrupts interactions among regions, leading to semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce plug-and-play multi-concept adaptive blending for high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis (PnP-MIX), an innovative, tuning-free approach designed to seamlessly embed multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image. Our method leverages guided appearance attention to faithfully reflect the intended appearance of each personalized concept. To further enhance compositional fidelity, we present a mask-guided noise mixing strategy that preserves the integrity of non-personalized regions such as the background or unrelated objects while enabling the precise integration of personalized objects. Finally, to mitigate concept leakage, i.e., the inadvertent leakage of personalized concept features into other regions, we propose background dilution++, a novel strategy that effectively reduces such leakage and promotes accurate localization of features within personalized regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PnP-MIX consistently surpasses existing methodologies in both single- and multi-concept personalization scenarios, underscoring its robustness and superior performance without additional model tuning.</description>

      <title>Foundational Question Generation for Video Question Answering via an Embedding-Integrated Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional VQA approaches primarily rely on question-answer (Q&amp;A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics of video content. However, most existing annotations are event-centric, which restricts the model's ability to capture the comprehensive context of a scene. The lack of fundamental information such as object categories, spatial configurations, and descriptive visual attributes prevents the model from forming a complete understanding of the environment, ultimately limiting its generalization and reasoning capability. In this paper, we introduce Foundational Question Generation for Video Question Answering via an Embedding-Integrated Approach (FIQ), a framework designed to enhance the reasoning capability of VQA models by improving their foundational comprehension of video content. FIQ generates Q&amp;A pairs from descriptive information extracted directly from videos, thereby enriching the dataset with core scene-level attributes. These generated pairs help the model develop a more holistic understanding of the video, leading to improved generalizability and reasoning performance. In addition, we propose a VQ-CAlign module that aligns task-specific question embeddings with corresponding visual features, preserving essential contextual cues and enhancing adaptability to downstream tasks. Experimental results on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset demonstrate that FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Encoding and Annotating of 3D Bounding Box: Corner-Aware 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Center-aligned regression remains dominant in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, yet it suffers from fundamental instability: object centers often fall in sparse or empty regions of the bird's-eye-view (BEV) due to the front-surface-biased nature of LiDAR point clouds, leading to noisy and inaccurate bounding box predictions. To circumvent this limitation, we revisit bounding box representation and propose corner-aligned regression, which shifts the prediction target from unstable centers to geometrically informative corners that reside in dense, observable regions. Leveraging the inherent geometric constraints among corners and image 2D boxes, partial parameters of 3D bounding boxes can be recovered from corner annotations, enabling a weakly supervised paradigm without requiring complete 3D labels. We design a simple yet effective corner-aware detection head that can be plugged into existing detectors. Experiments on KITTI show our method improves performance by 3.5% AP over center-based baseline, and achieves 83% of fully supervised accuracy using only BEV corner clicks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our corner-aware regression strategy.</description>

      <title>BD-Net: Has Depth-Wise Convolution Ever Been Applied in Binary Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in model compression have highlighted the potential of low-bit precision techniques, with Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) attracting attention for their extreme efficiency. However, extreme quantization in BNNs limits representational capacity and destabilizes training, posing significant challenges for lightweight architectures with depth-wise convolutions. To address this, we propose a 1.58-bit convolution to enhance expressiveness and a pre-BN residual connection to stabilize optimization by improving the Hessian condition number. These innovations enable, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful binarization of depth-wise convolutions in BNNs. Our method achieves 33M OPs on ImageNet with MobileNet V1, establishing a new state-of-the-art in BNNs by outperforming prior methods with comparable OPs. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing methods across various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Tiny ImageNet, and Oxford Flowers 102, with accuracy improvements of up to 9.3 percentage points.</description>

      <title>Efficient Score Pre-computation for Diffusion Models via Cross-Matrix Krylov Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate score-based diffusion models. It first converts the standard stable diffusion model into the Fokker-Planck formulation which results in solving large linear systems for each image. For training involving many images, it can lead to a high computational cost. The core innovation is a cross-matrix Krylov projection method that exploits mathematical similarities between matrices, using a shared subspace built from ``seed" matrices to rapidly solve for subsequent ``target" matrices. Our experiments show that this technique achieves a 15.8\% to 43.7\% time reduction over standard sparse solvers. Additionally, we compare our method against DDPM baselines in denoising tasks, showing a speedup of up to 115$\times$. Furthermore, under a fixed computational budget, our model is able to produce high-quality images while DDPM fails to generate recognizable content, illustrating our approach is a practical method for efficient generation in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Upstream Probabilistic Meta-Imputation for Multimodal Pediatric Pancreatitis Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pediatric pancreatitis is a progressive and debilitating inflammatory condition, including acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis, that presents significant clinical diagnostic challenges. Machine learning-based methods also face diagnostic challenges due to limited sample availability and multimodal imaging complexity. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Upstream Probabilistic Meta-Imputation (UPMI), a light-weight augmentation strategy that operates upstream of a meta-learner in a low-dimensional meta-feature space rather than in image space. Modality-specific logistic regressions (T1W and T2W MRI radiomics) produce probability outputs that are transformed into a 7-dimensional meta-feature vector. Class-conditional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are then fit within each cross-validation fold to sample synthetic meta-features that, combined with real meta-features, train a Random Forest (RF) meta-classifier. On 67 pediatric subjects with paired T1W/T2W MRIs, UPMI achieves a mean AUC of 0.908 $\pm$ 0.072, a $\sim$5% relative gain over a real-only baseline (AUC 0.864 $\pm$ 0.061).</description>

      <title>TSRE: Channel-Aware Typical Set Refinement for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a critical capability for ensuring the safe deployment of machine learning models in open-world environments, where unexpected or anomalous inputs can compromise model reliability and performance. Activation-based methods play a fundamental role in OOD detection by mitigating anomalous activations and enhancing the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. However, existing methods apply activation rectification while often overlooking channel's intrinsic characteristics and distributional skewness, which results in inaccurate typical set estimation. This discrepancy can lead to the improper inclusion of anomalous activations across channels. To address this limitation, we propose a typical set refinement method based on discriminability and activity, which rectifies activations into a channel-aware typical set. Furthermore, we introduce a skewness-based refinement to mitigate distributional bias in typical set estimation. Finally, we leverage the rectified activations to compute the energy score for OOD detection. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-100 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes effectively across backbones and score functions.</description>

      <title>SWITCH: Benchmarking Modeling and Handling of Tangible Interfaces in Long-horizon Embodied Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous intelligence requires not only perception and reasoning, but critically, effective interaction with the existing world and its infrastructure. Everyday environments are rich in tangible control interfaces (TCIs), e.g., light switches, appliance panels, and embedded GUIs, that demand commonsense and physics reasoning, but also causal prediction and outcome verification in time and space (e.g., delayed heating, remote lights). Moreover, failures here have potential safety implications, yet current benchmarks rarely test grounding, partial observability (video), or post-hoc verification in situated settings. We introduce SWITCH (Semantic World Interface Tasks for Control and Handling), an embodied, task-driven benchmark created through iterative releases to probe these gaps. Its first iteration, SWITCH-Basic, evaluates five complementary abilities:task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state-transition prediction, and result verification, under egocentric RGB video input and device diversity. Across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices and appliances, commercial and open LMMMs exhibit inconsistent performance even on single-step interactions, often over-relying on textual cues and under-using visual or video evidence (and high aggregate scores can mask such failures). SWITCH provides data, code, and held-out splits to enable reproducible evaluation and community contributions toward more challenging future iterations of the benchmark and the creation of training datasets. Benchmark resources are available at: https://github.com/BAAI-Agents/SWITCH.</description>

      <title>Explainable Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Classification: Comprehensive Benchmarking with Dual Interpretability and Lightweight Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study provides a full deep learning system for automated classification of brain tumors from MRI images, includes six benchmarked architectures (five ImageNet-pre-trained models (VGG-16, Inception V3, ResNet-50, Inception-ResNet V2, Xception) and a custom built, compact CNN (1.31M params)). The study moves the needle forward in a number of ways, including (1) full standardization of assessment with respect to preprocessing, training sets/protocols (optimizing networks with the AdamW optimizer, CosineAnnealingLR, patiene for early stopping = 7), and metrics to assess performance were identical along all models; (2) a high level of confidence in the localizations based on prior studies as both Grad-CAM and GradientShap explanation were used to establish anatomically important and meaningful attention regions and address the black-box issue; (3) a compact 1.31 million parameter CNN was developed that achieved 96.49% testing accuracy and was 100 times smaller than Inception-ResNet V2 while permitting real-time inference (375ms) on edge devices; (4) full evaluation beyond accuracy reporting based on measures of intersection over union, Hausdorff distance, and precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices across all splits. Inception-ResNet V2 reached state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 99.53% accuracy on testing and obtaining a precision, recall, and F1-score of at least 99.50% dominant performance based on metrics of recent studies. We demonstrated a lightweight model that is suitable to deploy on devices that do not have multi-GPU infrastructure in under-resourced settings. This end-to-end solution considers accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of trustworthy AI to create the framework necessary for performance assessment and deployment within advance and low-resource healthcare systems to an extent that enabled participation at the clinical screening and triage level.</description>

      <title>MedPEFT-CL: Dual-Phase Parameter-Efficient Continual Learning with Medical Semantic Adapter and Bidirectional Memory Consolidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical vision-language segmentation models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new anatomical structures, requiring complete retraining that limits their clinical deployment. Although continual learning approaches have been studied for various applications, targeted research on continual learning approaches specifically designed for medical vision-language tasks remains underexplored. We propose MedPEFT-CL, a parameter-efficient continual learning framework that addresses both efficient learning of new tasks and preservation of previous knowledge through a dual-phase architecture based on CLIPSeg. Our dual-phase architecture features an adaptive learning phase that employs semantic similarity-based adapter allocation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for medical tasks through prompt similarity analysis, and a knowledge consolidation phase employing bi-directional Fisher-memory coordination. This creates a reinforcing cycle: consolidation directs replay priorities while new tasks provide challenging samples that improve retention strategies. Our key contributions are: (1) a semantic-driven adapter allocation mechanism that enables efficient learning of new medical tasks, (2) a bi-modal LoRA adaptation that significantly reduces trainable parameters while maintaining cross-modal learning, and (3) bidirectional Fisher-memory coordination that prevents catastrophic forgetting from previous medical tasks. Extensive experiments across diverse medical datasets demonstrate superior forgetting mitigation and performance retention with minimal parameter overhead, making the framework effective for continual learning in medical vision-language scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of airborne platforms and imaging sensors is enabling new forms of aerial surveillance due to their unprecedented advantages in scale, mobility, deployment, and covert observation capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of 150+ papers over the last 10 years of human-centric aerial surveillance tasks from a computer vision and machine learning perspective. It aims to provide readers with an in-depth systematic review and technical analysis of the current state of aerial surveillance tasks using drones, UAVs, and other airborne platforms. The object of interest is humans, where human subjects are to be detected, identified, and re-identified. More specifically, for each of these tasks, we first identify unique challenges in performing these tasks in an aerial setting compared to the popular ground-based setting and subsequently compile and analyze aerial datasets publicly available for each task. Most importantly, we delve deep into the approaches in the aerial surveillance literature with a focus on investigating how they presently address aerial challenges and techniques for improvement. We conclude the paper by discussing the gaps and open research questions to inform future research avenues.</description>

      <title>Vision-Motion-Reference Alignment for Referring Multi-Object Tracking via Multi-Modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) extends conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) by introducing natural language references for multi-modal fusion tracking. RMOT benchmarks only describe the object's appearance, relative positions, and initial motion states. This so-called static regulation fails to capture dynamic changes of the object motion, including velocity changes and motion direction shifts. This limitation not only causes a temporal discrepancy between static references and dynamic vision modality but also constrains multi-modal tracking performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Vision-Motion-Reference aligned RMOT framework, named VMRMOT. It integrates a motion modality extracted from object dynamics to enhance the alignment between vision modality and language references through multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we introduce motion-aware descriptions derived from object dynamic behaviors and, leveraging the powerful temporal-reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, extract motion features as the motion modality. We further design a Vision-Motion-Reference Alignment (VMRA) module to hierarchically align visual queries with motion and reference cues, enhancing their cross-modal consistency. In addition, a Motion-Guided Prediction Head (MGPH) is developed to explore motion modality to enhance the performance of the prediction head. To the best of our knowledge, VMRMOT is the first approach to employ MLLMs in the RMOT task for vision-reference alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple RMOT benchmarks demonstrate that VMRMOT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Understanding Counting Mechanisms in Large Language and Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) represent and compute numerical information in counting tasks. We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions. Overall, counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same general pattern in LVLMs, shaped by the properties of the vision encoder.</description>

      <title>Can Vision-Language Models Count? A Synthetic Benchmark and Analysis of Attention-Based Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research suggests that Vision Language Models (VLMs) often rely on inherent biases learned during training when responding to queries about visual properties of images. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly specific questions that require them to focus on particular areas of the image in tasks such as counting. We build upon this research by developing a synthetic benchmark dataset and evaluation framework to systematically determine how counting performance varies as image and prompt properties change. Using open-source VLMs, we then analyze how attention allocation fluctuates with varying input parameters (e.g. number of objects in the image, objects color, background color, objects texture, background texture, and prompt specificity). We further implement attention-based interventions to modulate focus on visual tokens at different layers and evaluate their impact on counting performance across a range of visual conditions. Our experiments reveal that while VLM counting performance remains challenging, especially under high visual or linguistic complexity, certain attention interventions can lead to modest gains in counting performance.</description>

      <title>AngioDG: Interpretable Channel-informed Feature-modulated Single-source Domain Generalization for Coronary Vessel Segmentation in X-ray Angiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, with X-ray Coronary Angiography (XCA) as the gold standard during real-time cardiac interventions. Segmentation of coronary vessels from XCA can facilitate downstream quantitative assessments, such as measurement of the stenosis severity and enhancing clinical decision-making. However, developing generalizable vessel segmentation models for XCA is challenging due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics that cause domain shifts. These limitations are exacerbated by the lack of annotated datasets, making Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) a necessary solution for achieving generalization. Existing SDG methods are largely augmentation-based, which may not guarantee the mitigation of overfitting to augmented or synthetic domains. We propose a novel approach, ``AngioDG", to bridge this gap by channel regularization strategy to promote generalization. Our method identifies the contributions of early feature channels to task-specific metrics for DG, facilitating interpretability, and then reweights channels to calibrate and amplify domain-invariant features while attenuating domain-specific ones. We evaluate AngioDG on 6 x-ray angiography datasets for coronary vessels segmentation, achieving the best out-of-distribution performance among the compared methods, while maintaining consistent in-domain test performance.</description>

      <title>The Potential and Limitations of Vision-Language Models for Human Motion Understanding: A Case Study in Data-Driven Stroke Rehabilitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of computer-vision tasks, sparking interest in their potential for digital health applications. Here, we apply VLMs to two fundamental challenges in data-driven stroke rehabilitation: automatic quantification of rehabilitation dose and impairment from videos. We formulate these problems as motion-identification tasks, which can be addressed using VLMs. We evaluate our proposed framework on a cohort of 29 healthy controls and 51 stroke survivors. Our results show that current VLMs lack the fine-grained motion understanding required for precise quantification: dose estimates are comparable to a baseline that excludes visual information, and impairment scores cannot be reliably predicted. Nevertheless, several findings suggest future promise. With optimized prompting and post-processing, VLMs can classify high-level activities from a few frames, detect motion and grasp with moderate accuracy, and approximate dose counts within 25% of ground truth for mildly impaired and healthy participants, all without task-specific training or finetuning. These results highlight both the current limitations and emerging opportunities of VLMs for data-driven stroke rehabilitation and broader clinical video analysis.</description>

      <title>VisReason: A Large-Scale Dataset for Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven remarkably effective for eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its potential in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains largely untapped, hindered by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the rich, spatially grounded reasoning intrinsic to visual understanding. Existing visual-CoT resources are typically small, domain-specific, or lack the human-like stepwise structure necessary for compositional visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisReason, a large-scale dataset designed to advance visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VisReason comprises 489K annotated examples spanning four diverse domains, each featuring multi-round, human-like rationales that guide MLLMs through interpretable visual reasoning steps. Building upon this, we curate VisReason-Pro, a 165K subset produced with a stronger expert-level GPT annotator, enriched with detailed reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding via depth-informed annotations. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-VL model on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization. These results demonstrate that VisReason equips MLLMs with more systematic and generalizable reasoning capabilities. We envision VisReason as a cornerstone for cultivating human-like visual reasoning, paving the way toward the next generation of multimodal intelligence.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-Ended Visual Scientific Discovery with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific archives now contain hundreds of petabytes of data across genomics, ecology, climate, and molecular biology that could reveal undiscovered patterns if systematically analyzed at scale. Large-scale, weakly-supervised datasets in language and vision have driven the development of foundation models whose internal representations encode structure (patterns, co-occurrences and statistical regularities) beyond their training objectives. Most existing methods extract structure only for pre-specified targets; they excel at confirmation but do not support open-ended discovery of unknown patterns. We ask whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can enable open-ended feature discovery from foundation model representations. We evaluate this question in controlled rediscovery studies, where the learned SAE features are tested for alignment with semantic concepts on a standard segmentation benchmark and compared against strong label-free alternatives on concept-alignment metrics. Applied to ecological imagery, the same procedure surfaces fine-grained anatomical structure without access to segmentation or part labels, providing a scientific case study with ground-truth validation. While our experiments focus on vision with an ecology case study, the method is domain-agnostic and applicable to models in other sciences (e.g., proteins, genomics, weather). Our results indicate that sparse decomposition provides a practical instrument for exploring what scientific foundation models have learned, an important prerequisite for moving from confirmation to genuine discovery.</description>

      <title>AEGIS: Preserving privacy of 3D Facial Avatars with Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of photorealistic 3D facial avatars, particularly those utilizing efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, introduces new risks of online identity theft, especially in systems that rely on biometric authentication. While effective adversarial masking methods have been developed for 2D images, a significant gap remains in achieving robust, viewpoint-consistent identity protection for dynamic 3D avatars. To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB). It also preserves key facial attributes such as age, race, gender, and emotion, demonstrating strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion.</description>

      <title>SPIDER: Spatial Image CorresponDence Estimator for Robust Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable image correspondences form the foundation of vision-based spatial perception, enabling recovery of 3D structure and camera poses. However, unconstrained feature matching across domains such as aerial, indoor, and outdoor scenes remains challenging due to large variations in appearance, scale and viewpoint. Feature matching has been conventionally formulated as a 2D-to-2D problem; however, recent 3D foundation models provides spatial feature matching properties based on two-view geometry. While powerful, we observe that these spatially coherent matches often concentrate on dominant planar regions, e.g., walls or ground surfaces, while being less sensitive to fine-grained geometric details, particularly under large viewpoint changes. To better understand these trade-offs, we first perform linear probe experiments to evaluate the performance of various vision foundation models for image matching. Building on these insights, we introduce SPIDER, a universal feature matching framework that integrates a shared feature extraction backbone with two specialized network heads for estimating both 2D-based and 3D-based correspondences from coarse to fine. Finally, we introduce an image-matching evaluation benchmark that focuses on unconstrained scenarios with large baselines. SPIDER significantly outperforms SoTA methods, demonstrating its strong ability as a universal image-matching method.</description>

      <title>CORA: Consistency-Guided Semi-Supervised Framework for Reasoning Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning segmentation seeks pixel-accurate masks for targets referenced by complex, often implicit instructions, requiring context-dependent reasoning over the scene. Recent multimodal language models have advanced instruction following segmentation, yet generalization remains limited. The key bottleneck is the high cost of curating diverse, high-quality pixel annotations paired with rich linguistic supervision leading to brittle performance under distribution shift. Therefore, we present CORA, a semi-supervised reasoning segmentation framework that jointly learns from limited labeled data and a large corpus of unlabeled images. CORA introduces three main components: 1) conditional visual instructions that encode spatial and contextual relationships between objects; 2) a noisy pseudo-label filter based on the consistency of Multimodal LLM's outputs across semantically equivalent queries; and 3) a token-level contrastive alignment between labeled and pseudo-labeled samples to enhance feature consistency. These components enable CORA to perform robust reasoning segmentation with minimal supervision, outperforming existing baselines under constrained annotation settings. CORA achieves state-of-the-art results, requiring as few as 100 labeled images on Cityscapes, a benchmark dataset for urban scene understanding, surpassing the baseline by $+2.3\%$. Similarly, CORA improves performance by $+2.4\%$ with only 180 labeled images on PanNuke, a histopathology dataset.</description>

      <title>Latent Dirichlet Transformer VAE for Hyperspectral Unmixing with Bundled Endmembers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral images capture rich spectral information that enables per-pixel material identification; however, spectral mixing often obscures pure material signatures. To address this challenge, we propose the Latent Dirichlet Transformer Variational Autoencoder (LDVAE-T) for hyperspectral unmixing. Our model combines the global context modeling capabilities of transformer architectures with physically meaningful constraints imposed by a Dirichlet prior in the latent space. This prior naturally enforces the sum-to-one and non-negativity conditions essential for abundance estimation, thereby improving the quality of predicted mixing ratios. A key contribution of LDVAE-T is its treatment of materials as bundled endmembers, rather than relying on fixed ground truth spectra. In the proposed method our decoder predicts, for each endmember and each patch, a mean spectrum together with a structured (segmentwise) covariance that captures correlated spectral variability. Reconstructions are formed by mixing these learned bundles with Dirichlet-distributed abundances garnered from a transformer encoder, allowing the model to represent intrinsic material variability while preserving physical interpretability. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, Samson, Jasper Ridge, and HYDICE Urban and show that LDVAE-T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in abundance estimation and endmember extraction, as measured by root mean squared error and spectral angle distance, respectively.</description>

      <title>Deepfake Geography: Detecting AI-Generated Satellite Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models such as StyleGAN2 and Stable Diffusion poses a growing threat to the authenticity of satellite imagery, which is increasingly vital for reliable analysis and decision-making across scientific and security domains. While deepfake detection has been extensively studied in facial contexts, satellite imagery presents distinct challenges, including terrain-level inconsistencies and structural artifacts. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) for detecting AI-generated satellite images. Using a curated dataset of over 130,000 labeled RGB images from the DM-AER and FSI datasets, we show that ViTs significantly outperform CNNs in both accuracy (95.11 percent vs. 87.02 percent) and overall robustness, owing to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global semantic structures. We further enhance model transparency using architecture-specific interpretability methods, including Grad-CAM for CNNs and Chefer's attention attribution for ViTs, revealing distinct detection behaviors and validating model trustworthiness. Our results highlight the ViT's superior performance in detecting structural inconsistencies and repetitive textural patterns characteristic of synthetic imagery. Future work will extend this research to multispectral and SAR modalities and integrate frequency-domain analysis to further strengthen detection capabilities and safeguard satellite imagery integrity in high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Target-Bench: Can World Models Achieve Mapless Path Planning with Semantic Targets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent world models generate highly realistic videos, their ability to perform robot path planning remains unclear and unquantified. We introduce Target-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate world models on mapless path planning toward semantic targets in real-world environments. Target-Bench provides 450 robot-collected video sequences spanning 45 semantic categories with SLAM-based ground truth trajectories. Our evaluation pipeline recovers camera motion from generated videos and measures planning performance using five complementary metrics that quantify target-reaching capability, trajectory accuracy, and directional consistency. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including Sora 2, Veo 3.1, and the Wan series. The best off-the-shelf model (Wan2.2-Flash) achieves only 0.299 overall score, revealing significant limitations in current world models for robotic planning tasks. We show that fine-tuning an open-source 5B-parameter model on only 325 scenarios from our dataset achieves 0.345 overall score -- an improvement of more than 400% over its base version (0.066) and 15% higher than the best off-the-shelf model. We will open-source the code and dataset.</description>

      <title>Attention Guided Alignment in Efficient Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) rely on effective multimodal alignment between pre-trained vision encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate visual and textual information. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of attention patterns in efficient VLMs, revealing that concatenation-based architectures frequently fail to distinguish between semantically matching and non-matching image-text pairs. This is a key factor for object hallucination in these models. To address this, we introduce Attention-Guided Efficient Vision-Language Models (AGE-VLM), a novel framework that enhances visual grounding through interleaved cross-attention layers to instill vision capabilities in pretrained small language models. This enforces in VLM the ability "look" at the correct image regions by leveraging spatial knowledge distilled from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), significantly reducing hallucination. We validate our approach across different vision-centric benchmarks where our method is better or comparable to prior work on efficient VLMs. Our findings provide valuable insights for future research aimed at achieving enhanced visual and linguistic understanding in VLMs.</description>

      <title>Pillar-0: A New Frontier for Radiology Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiology plays an integral role in modern medicine, yet rising imaging volumes have far outpaced workforce growth. Foundation models offer a path toward assisting with the full spectrum of radiology tasks, but existing medical models remain limited: they process volumetric CT and MRI as low-fidelity 2D slices, discard critical grayscale contrast information, and lack evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical practice. We introduce Pillar-0, a radiology foundation model pretrained on 42,990 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 86,411 chest CTs, 14,348 head CTs, and 11,543 breast MRIs from a large academic center, together with RATE, a scalable framework that extracts structured labels for 366 radiologic findings with near-perfect accuracy using LLMs. Across internal test sets of 14,230 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 10,646 chest CTs, 4,906 head CTs, and 1,585 breast MRIs, Pillar-0 establishes a new performance frontier, achieving mean AUROCs of 86.4, 88.0, 90.1, and 82.9, outperforming MedGemma (Google), MedImageInsight (Microsoft), Lingshu (Alibaba), and Merlin (Stanford) by 7.8-15.8 AUROC points and ranking best in 87.2\% (319/366) tasks. Pillar-0 similarly outperforms all baselines in an external validation on the Stanford Abdominal CT dataset, including Merlin (82.2 vs 80.6 AUROC). Pillar-0 extends to tasks beyond its pretraining, such as long-horizon lung cancer risk prediction, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art Sybil by 3.0 C-index points on NLST, and generalizes with gains of 5.9 (MGH) and 1.9 (CGMH). In brain hemorrhage detection, Pillar-0 obtained a &gt;95 AUROC when using only 1/20th of the data of the next most sample efficient baseline. Pillar-0 and RATE together provide an open, clinically rigorous foundation for building high-performance radiology systems, enabling applications that were previously infeasible due to computational, data, and evaluation constraints.</description>

      <title>A Stitch in Time: Learning Procedural Workflow via Self-Supervised Plackett-Luce Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Procedural activities, ranging from routine cooking to complex surgical operations, are highly structured as a set of actions conducted in a specific temporal order. Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.</description>

      <title>REXO: Indoor Multi-View Radar Object Detection via 3D Bounding Box Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.</description>

      <title>Importance-Weighted Non-IID Sampling for Flow Matching Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-matching models effectively represent complex distributions, yet estimating expectations of functions of their outputs remains challenging under limited sampling budgets. Independent sampling often yields high-variance estimates, especially when rare but with high-impact outcomes dominate the expectation. We propose an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework that jointly draws multiple samples to cover diverse, salient regions of a flow's distribution while maintaining unbiased estimation via estimated importance weights. To balance diversity and quality, we introduce a score-based regularization for the diversity mechanism, which uses the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log probability, to ensure samples are pushed apart within high-density regions of the data manifold, mitigating off-manifold drift. We further develop the first approach for importance weighting of non-IID flow samples by learning a residual velocity field that reproduces the marginal distribution of the non-IID samples. Empirically, our method produces diverse, high-quality samples and accurate estimates of both importance weights and expectations, advancing the reliable characterization of flow-matching model outputs. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>QAL: A Loss for Recall Precision Balance in 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volumetric learning underpins many 3D vision tasks such as completion, reconstruction, and mesh generation, yet training objectives still rely on Chamfer Distance (CD) or Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which fail to balance recall and precision. We propose Quality-Aware Loss (QAL), a drop-in replacement for CD/EMD that combines a coverage-weighted nearest-neighbor term with an uncovered-ground-truth attraction term, explicitly decoupling recall and precision into tunable components.
  Across diverse pipelines, QAL achieves consistent coverage gains, improving by an average of +4.3 pts over CD and +2.8 pts over the best alternatives. Though modest in percentage, these improvements reliably recover thin structures and under-represented regions that CD/EMD overlook. Extensive ablations confirm stable performance across hyperparameters and across output resolutions, while full retraining on PCN and ShapeNet demonstrates generalization across datasets and backbones. Moreover, QAL-trained completions yield higher grasp scores under GraspNet evaluation, showing that improved coverage translates directly into more reliable robotic manipulation.
  QAL thus offers a principled, interpretable, and practical objective for robust 3D vision and safety-critical robotics pipelines</description>

      <title>Toward explainable AI approaches for breast imaging: adapting foundation models to diverse populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models hold promise for specialized medical imaging tasks, though their effectiveness in breast imaging remains underexplored. This study leverages BiomedCLIP as a foundation model to address challenges in model generalization. BiomedCLIP was adapted for automated BI-RADS breast density classification using multi-modality mammographic data (synthesized 2D images, digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis). Using 96,995 images, we compared single-modality (s2D only) and multi-modality training approaches, addressing class imbalance through weighted contrastive learning. Both approaches achieved similar accuracy (multi-modality: 0.74, single-modality: 0.73), with the multi-modality model offering broader applicability across different imaging modalities and higher AUC values consistently above 0.84 across BI-RADS categories. External validation on the RSNA and EMBED datasets showed strong generalization capabilities (AUC range: 0.80-0.93). GradCAM visualizations confirmed consistent and clinically relevant attention patterns, highlighting the models interpretability and robustness. This research underscores the potential of foundation models for breast imaging applications, paving the way for future extensions for diagnostic tasks.</description>

      <title>Show Me: Unifying Instructional Image and Video Generation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating visual instructions in a given context is essential for developing interactive world simulators. While prior works address this problem through either text-guided image manipulation or video prediction, these tasks are typically treated in isolation. This separation reveals a fundamental issue: image manipulation methods overlook how actions unfold over time, while video prediction models often ignore the intended outcomes. To this end, we propose ShowMe, a unified framework that enables both tasks by selectively activating the spatial and temporal components of video diffusion models. In addition, we introduce structure and motion consistency rewards to improve structural fidelity and temporal coherence. Notably, this unification brings dual benefits: the spatial knowledge gained through video pretraining enhances contextual consistency and realism in non-rigid image edits, while the instruction-guided manipulation stage equips the model with stronger goal-oriented reasoning for video prediction. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms expert models in both instructional image and video generation, highlighting the strength of video diffusion models as a unified action-object state transformer.</description>

      <title>JigsawComm: Joint Semantic Feature Encoding and Transmission for Communication-Efficient Cooperative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent cooperative perception (CP) promises to overcome the inherent occlusion and sensing-range limitations of single-agent systems (e.g., autonomous driving). However, its practicality is severely constrained by the limited communication bandwidth. Existing approaches attempt to improve bandwidth efficiency via compression or heuristic message selection, without considering the semantic relevance or cross-agent redundancy of sensory data. We argue that a practical CP system must maximize the contribution of every transmitted bit to the final perception task, by extracting and transmitting semantically essential and non-redundant data. In this paper, we formulate a joint semantic feature encoding and transmission problem, which aims to maximize CP accuracy under limited bandwidth. To solve this problem, we introduce JigsawComm, an end-to-end trained, semantic-aware, and communication-efficient CP framework that learns to ``assemble the puzzle'' of multi-agent feature transmission. It uses a regularized encoder to extract semantically-relevant and sparse features, and a lightweight Feature Utility Estimator to predict the contribution of each agent's features to the final perception task. The resulting meta utility maps are exchanged among agents and leveraged to compute a provably optimal transmission policy, which selects features from agents with the highest utility score for each location. This policy inherently eliminates redundancy and achieves a scalable $\mathcal{O}(1)$ communication cost as the number of agents increases. On the benchmarks OPV2V and DAIR-V2X, JigsawComm reduces the total data volume by up to $&gt;$500$\times$ while achieving matching or superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-video diffusion models to add new generative controls, such as those over physical camera parameters (e.g., shutter speed or aperture), typically requires vast, high-fidelity datasets that are difficult to acquire. In this work, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that learns these controls from sparse, low-quality synthetic data. We show that not only does fine-tuning on such simple data enable the desired controls, it actually yields superior results to models fine-tuned on photorealistic "real" data. Beyond demonstrating these results, we provide a framework that justifies this phenomenon both intuitively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>MGA-VQA: Secure and Interpretable Graph-Augmented Visual Question Answering with Memory-Guided Protection Against Unauthorized Knowledge Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly understand textual semantics, spatial layout, and visual features. Current methods struggle with explicit spatial relationship modeling, inefficiency with high-resolution documents, multi-hop reasoning, and limited interpretability. We propose MGA-VQA, a multi-modal framework that integrates token-level encoding, spatial graph reasoning, memory-augmented inference, and question-guided compression. Unlike prior black-box models, MGA-VQA introduces interpretable graph-based decision pathways and structured memory access for enhanced reasoning transparency. Evaluation across six benchmarks (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA, STE-VQA, and RICO) demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency, with consistent improvements in both answer prediction and spatial localization.</description>

      <title>ArticFlow: Generative Simulation of Articulated Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have produced strong results for static 3D shapes, whereas articulated 3D generation remains challenging due to action-dependent deformations and limited datasets. We introduce ArticFlow, a two-stage flow matching framework that learns a controllable velocity field from noise to target point sets under explicit action control. ArticFlow couples (i) a latent flow that transports noise to a shape-prior code and (ii) a point flow that transports points conditioned on the action and the shape prior, enabling a single model to represent diverse articulated categories and generalize across actions. On MuJoCo Menagerie, ArticFlow functions both as a generative model and as a neural simulator: it predicts action-conditioned kinematics from a compact prior and synthesizes novel morphologies via latent interpolation. Compared with object-specific simulators and an action-conditioned variant of static point-cloud generators, ArticFlow achieves higher kinematic accuracy and better shape quality. Results show that action-conditioned flow matching is a practical route to controllable and high-quality articulated mechanism generation.</description>

      <title>FastMMoE: Accelerating Multimodal Large Language Models through Dynamic Expert Activation and Routing-Aware Token Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance, but high-resolution visual inputs result in long sequences of visual tokens and substantial inference latency. Reducing redundant visual tokens is critical to ease computational/memory burdens while preserving performance, enabling MLLM deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive scenarios. Current visual token pruning methods mainly rely on attention-based redundancy analysis and are tailored to dense architectures. We propose Fast Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (FastMMoE), a training-free acceleration framework for mixture-of-experts (MoE) based MLLMs, developed from a routing analysis perspective. FastMMoE combines two complementary strategies: (i) expert activation reduction for visual tokens to minimize unnecessary expert computation; and (ii) routing-aware token pruning that leverages similarity in routing probability distributions to identify and remove highly redundant visual tokens. Experiments on large-scale MoE-MLLMs such as DeepSeek-VL2 and InternVL3.5 demonstrate that FastMMoE can reduce FLOPs by up to 55.0% while retaining approximately 95.5% of the original performance, consistently outperforming dense-model pruning baselines including FastV and SparseVLM across multiple retention rates.</description>

      <title>When Better Teachers Don't Make Better Students: Revisiting Knowledge Distillation for CLIP Models in VQA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across multimodal tasks, yet their substantial computational demands hinder efficient deployment. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful approach for building lightweight but competitive models, with strong evidence from both language and vision domains. However, its application to VLMs, particularly CLIP-style models, remains limited, often constrained to small-scale teachers and narrow evaluation tasks such as classification or retrieval. In this work, we present the first systematic study of distillation across a range of CLIP-style teacher models, ranging from standard baselines to large-scale state-of-the-art models. Contrary to trends observed in NLP and vision, we find that stronger teachers do not consistently yield better students; in fact, existing distillation frameworks often fail to scale, leading to degraded performance in downstream multimodal tasks such as visual question answering. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in KD and point toward new directions for designing parameter-efficient multimodal models.</description>

      <title>MINDiff: Mask-Integrated Negative Attention for Controlling Overfitting in Text-to-Image Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the personalization process of large-scale text-to-image models, overfitting often occurs when learning specific subject from a limited number of images. Existing methods, such as DreamBooth, mitigate this issue through a class-specific prior-preservation loss, which requires increased computational cost during training and limits user control during inference time. To address these limitations, we propose Mask-Integrated Negative Attention Diffusion (MINDiff). MINDiff introduces a novel concept, negative attention, which suppresses the subject's influence in masked irrelevant regions. We achieve this by modifying the cross-attention mechanism during inference. This enables semantic control and improves text alignment by reducing subject dominance in irrelevant regions. Additionally, during the inference time, users can adjust a scale parameter lambda to balance subject fidelity and text alignment. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments on DreamBooth models demonstrate that MINDiff mitigates overfitting more effectively than class-specific prior-preservation loss. As our method operates entirely at inference time and does not alter the model architecture, it can be directly applied to existing DreamBooth models without re-training. Our code is available at https://github.com/seuleepy/MINDiff.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation aims to compress large-scale datasets into compact subsets while preserving the performance of the original data. However, conventional Distribution Matching (DM) methods struggle to capture intrinsic cross-modal alignment. Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework. DAVDD leverages a diverse pretrained bank to obtain stable modality features and uses a lightweight decoupler bank to disentangle them into common and private representations. To effectively preserve cross-modal structure, we further introduce Common Intermodal Matching together with a Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment strategy, ensuring that shared representations are aligned both at the sample level and the global distribution level. Meanwhile, private representations are entirely isolated from cross-modal interaction, safeguarding modality-specific cues throughout distillation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DAVDD achieves state-of-the-art results under all IPC settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupled representation learning for high-quality audio-visual dataset distillation. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>CUS-GS: A Compact Unified Structured Gaussian Splatting Framework for Multimodal Scene Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting based 3D scene representation have shown two major trends: semantics-oriented approaches that focus on high-level understanding but lack explicit 3D geometry modeling, and structure-oriented approaches that capture spatial structures yet provide limited semantic abstraction. To bridge this gap, we present CUS-GS, a compact unified structured Gaussian Splatting representation, which connects multimodal semantic features with structured 3D geometry. Specifically, we design a voxelized anchor structure that constructs a spatial scaffold, while extracting multimodal semantic features from a set of foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, SEEM). Moreover, we introduce a multimodal latent feature allocation mechanism to unify appearance, geometry, and semantics across heterogeneous feature spaces, ensuring a consistent representation across multiple foundation models. Finally, we propose a feature-aware significance evaluation strategy to dynamically guide anchor growing and pruning, effectively removing redundant or invalid anchors while maintaining semantic integrity. Extensive experiments show that CUS-GS achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods using as few as 6M parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than the closest rival at 35M - highlighting the excellent trade off between performance and model efficiency of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Rectifying Soft-Label Entangled Bias in Long-Tailed Dataset Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large-scale datasets into compact, highly informative synthetic data, significantly reducing storage and training costs. However, existing research primarily focuses on balanced datasets and struggles to perform under real-world long-tailed distributions. In this work, we emphasize the critical role of soft labels in long-tailed dataset distillation and uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to performance degradation. Specifically, we derive an imbalance-aware generalization bound for model trained on distilled dataset. We then identify two primary sources of soft-label bias, which originate from the distillation model and the distilled images, through systematic perturbation of the data imbalance levels. To address this, we propose ADSA, an Adaptive Soft-label Alignment module that calibrates the entangled biases. This lightweight module integrates seamlessly into existing distillation pipelines and consistently improves performance. On ImageNet-1k-LT with EDC and IPC=50, ADSA improves tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% and raises overall accuracy to 41.4%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSA provides a robust and generalizable solution under limited label budgets and across a range of distillation techniques.

      <title>Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization for Improving 3D Gaussian Splatting Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excelling in most configurations, it lacks generalization across novel viewpoints in a few-shot scenario because it overfits to the sparse observations. We revisit 3DGS optimization from a machine learning perspective, framing novel view synthesis as a generalization problem to unseen viewpoints-an underexplored direction. We propose Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR), which reformulates the 3DGS training objective, thereby guiding 3DGS to converge toward a better generalization solution. Although Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) similarly reduces the sharpness of the loss landscape to improve generalization of classification models, directly employing it to 3DGS is suboptimal due to the discrepancy between the tasks. Specifically, it hinders reconstructing high-frequency details due to excessive regularization, while reducing its strength leads to under-penalizing sharpness. To address this, we reflect the local frequency of images to set the regularization weight and the neighborhood radius when estimating the local sharpness. It prevents floater artifacts in novel viewpoints and reconstructs fine details that SAM tends to oversmooth. Across datasets with various configurations, our method consistently improves a wide range of baselines. Code will be available at https://bbangsik13.github.io/FASR.</description>

      <title>PA-FAS: Towards Interpretable and Generalizable Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing via Path-Augmented Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has recently advanced in multimodal fusion, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability. With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.</description>

      <title>MambaTAD: When State-Space Models Meet Long-Range Temporal Action Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Action Detection (TAD) aims to identify and localize actions by determining their starting and ending frames within untrimmed videos. Recent Structured State-Space Models such as Mamba have demonstrated potential in TAD due to their long-range modeling capability and linear computational complexity. On the other hand, structured state-space models often face two key challenges in TAD, namely, decay of temporal context due to recursive processing and self-element conflict during global visual context modeling, which become more severe while handling long-span action instances. Additionally, traditional methods for TAD struggle with detecting long-span action instances due to a lack of global awareness and inefficient detection heads. This paper presents MambaTAD, a new state-space TAD model that introduces long-range modeling and global feature detection capabilities for accurate temporal action detection. MambaTAD comprises two novel designs that complement each other with superior TAD performance. First, it introduces a Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space (DMBSS) module which effectively facilitates global feature fusion and temporal action detection. Second, it introduces a global feature fusion head that refines the detection progressively with multi-granularity features and global awareness. In addition, MambaTAD tackles TAD in an end-to-end one-stage manner using a new state-space temporal adapter(SSTA) which reduces network parameters and computation cost with linear complexity. Extensive experiments show that MambaTAD achieves superior TAD performance consistently across multiple public benchmarks.</description>

      <title>UniRSCD: A Unified Novel Architectural Paradigm for Remote Sensing Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, remote sensing change detection has garnered significant attention due to its critical role in resource monitoring and disaster assessment. Change detection tasks exist with different output granularities such as BCD, SCD, and BDA. However, existing methods require substantial expert knowledge to design specialized decoders that compensate for information loss during encoding across different tasks. This not only introduces uncertainty into the process of selecting optimal models for abrupt change scenarios (such as disaster outbreaks) but also limits the universality of these architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, general change detection framework named UniRSCD. Building upon a state space model backbone, we introduce a frequency change prompt generator as a unified encoder. The encoder dynamically scans bitemporal global context information while integrating high-frequency details with low-frequency holistic information, thereby eliminating the need for specialized decoders for feature compensation. Subsequently, the unified decoder and prediction head establish a shared representation space through hierarchical feature interaction and task-adaptive output mapping. This integrating various tasks such as binary change detection and semantic change detection into a unified architecture, thereby accommodating the differing output granularity requirements of distinct change detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can adapt to multiple change detection tasks and achieves leading performance on five datasets, including the binary change dataset LEVIR-CD, the semantic change dataset SECOND, and the building damage assessment dataset xBD.</description>

      <title>Novel View Synthesis from A Few Glimpses via Test-Time Natural Video Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given just a few glimpses of a scene, can you imagine the movie playing out as the camera glides through it? That's the lens we take on \emph{sparse-input novel view synthesis}, not only as filling spatial gaps between widely spaced views, but also as \emph{completing a natural video} unfolding through space.
  We recast the task as \emph{test-time natural video completion}, using powerful priors from \emph{pretrained video diffusion models} to hallucinate plausible in-between views. Our \emph{zero-shot, generation-guided} framework produces pseudo views at novel camera poses, modulated by an \emph{uncertainty-aware mechanism} for spatial coherence. These synthesized frames densify supervision for \emph{3D Gaussian Splatting} (3D-GS) for scene reconstruction, especially in under-observed regions. An iterative feedback loop lets 3D geometry and 2D view synthesis inform each other, improving both the scene reconstruction and the generated views.
  The result is coherent, high-fidelity renderings from sparse inputs \emph{without any scene-specific training or fine-tuning}. On LLFF, DTU, DL3DV, and MipNeRF-360, our method significantly outperforms strong 3D-GS baselines under extreme sparsity.</description>

      <title>V2X-RECT: An Efficient V2X Trajectory Prediction Framework via Redundant Interaction Filtering and Tracking Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V2X prediction can alleviate perception incompleteness caused by limited line of sight through fusing trajectory data from infrastructure and vehicles, which is crucial to traffic safety and efficiency. However, in dense traffic scenarios, frequent identity switching of targets hinders cross-view association and fusion. Meanwhile, multi-source information tends to generate redundant interactions during the encoding stage, and traditional vehicle-centric encoding leads to large amounts of repetitive historical trajectory feature encoding, degrading real-time inference performance. To address these challenges, we propose V2X-RECT, a trajectory prediction framework designed for high-density environments. It enhances data association consistency, reduces redundant interactions, and reuses historical information to enable more efficient and accurate prediction. Specifically, we design a multi-source identity matching and correction module that leverages multi-view spatiotemporal relationships to achieve stable and consistent target association, mitigating the adverse effects of mismatches on trajectory encoding and cross-view feature fusion. Then we introduce traffic signal-guided interaction module, encoding trend of traffic light changes as features and exploiting their role in constraining spatiotemporal passage rights to accurately filter key interacting vehicles, while capturing the dynamic impact of signal changes on interaction patterns. Furthermore, a local spatiotemporal coordinate encoding enables reusable features of historical trajectories and map, supporting parallel decoding and significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experimental results across V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj datasets demonstrate that our V2X-RECT achieves significant improvements compared to SOTA methods, while also enhancing robustness and inference efficiency across diverse traffic densities.</description>

      <title>SciEducator: Scientific Video Understanding and Educating via Deming-Cycle Multi-Agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and video agent systems have significantly improved general video understanding. However, when applied to scientific video understanding and educating, a domain that demands external professional knowledge integration and rigorous step-wise reasoning, existing approaches often struggle. To bridge this gap, we propose SciEducator, the first iterative self-evolving multi-agent system for scientific video comprehension and education. Rooted in the classical Deming Cycle from management science, our design reformulates its Plan-Do-Study-Act philosophy into a self-evolving reasoning and feedback mechanism, which facilitates the interpretation of intricate scientific activities in videos. Moreover, SciEducator can produce multimodal educational content tailored to specific scientific processes, including textual instructions, visual guides, audio narrations, and interactive references. To support evaluation, we construct SciVBench, a benchmark consisting of 500 expert-verified and literature-grounded science QA pairs across five categories, covering physical, chemical, and everyday phenomena. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SciEducator substantially outperforms leading closed-source MLLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o) and state-of-the-art video agents on the benchmark, establishing a new paradigm for the community.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Temporal Sampling for Efficient MLLM Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processing long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) poses a significant computational challenge, as the model's self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of video tokens, resulting in high computational demand and slow inference speed. Current solutions, such as rule-based sub-sampling, learned frame selector, or memory-based summarization, often introduce their own trade-offs: they compromise accuracy, necessitate additional training, or decrease inference speed. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Temporal Sampling (T3S), a training-free, plug-and-play inference wrapper that enables MLLMs to process long videos both efficiently and effectively. T3S exploits spatiotemporal redundancy by generating multiple short and diverse subsequences of video tokens at inference time, packing them within a single forward pass, and aggregating their predictions. This multi-subsequence formulation broadens visual coverage while reducing the computational cost of self-attention from $O(L^2)$ to $O(\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i^2L^2)$, where $\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i^2 &lt; 1$. Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that T3S improves accuracy by up to 3.1% and reduces first token delay by $2.04\times$, all with minimal integration effort. Our approach operates entirely at inference time, requires no model modifications or fine-tuning, and is compatible with a wide range of pretrained MLLMs. T3S turns video redundancy into a computational advantage, offering a scalable solution for long-video understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/kaibinwang3/T3S.</description>

      <title>Multi-speaker Attention Alignment for Multimodal Social Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding social interaction in video requires reasoning over a dynamic interplay of verbal and non-verbal cues: who is speaking, to whom, and with what gaze or gestures. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are natural candidates, simply adding visual inputs yields surprisingly inconsistent gains on social tasks. Our quantitative analysis of cross-modal attention inside state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a core failure mode: in multi-speaker scenes, visual and textual tokens lack speaker-consistent alignment, exhibiting substantially weaker cross-modal attention than in object-centric images. To address this, we propose a multimodal multi-speaker attention alignment method that can be integrated into existing MLLMs. First, we introduce dynamic cross-modal head selection to identify attention heads most responsible for grounding. Then, an adaptive social-aware attention bias, computed from existing attention patterns and speaker locations, is injected into the attention mechanism. This bias reinforces alignment between a speaker's visual representation and their utterances without introducing trainable parameters or architectural changes. We integrate our method into three distinct MLLMs (LLaVA-NeXT-Video, Qwen2.5-VL, and InternVL3) and evaluate on three benchmarks (TVQA+, MMSI, OnlineMMSI). Across four social tasks, results demonstrate that our approach improves the ability of MLLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results. Attention visualizations confirm our method successfully focuses the model on speaker-relevant regions, enabling more robust multi-party social reasoning. Our implementation and model will be available at https://github.com/ut-vision/SocialInteraction.</description>

      <title>HEAL: Learning-Free Source Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Cross-Modality Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing demands for clinical data privacy and storage constraints have spurred advances in Source Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA). SFUDA addresses the domain shift by adapting models from the source domain to the unseen target domain without accessing source data, even when target-domain labels are unavailable. However, SFUDA faces significant challenges: the absence of source domain data and label supervision in the target domain due to source free and unsupervised settings. To address these issues, we propose HEAL, a novel SFUDA framework that integrates Hierarchical denoising, Edge-guided selection, size-Aware fusion, and Learning-free characteristic. Large-scale cross-modality experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SFUDA approaches, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

      <title>VITAL: Vision-Encoder-centered Pre-training for LMMs in Visual Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a robust visual quality assessment (VQualA) large multi-modal model (LMM) requires achieving versatility, powerfulness, and transferability.
  However, existing VQualA LMMs typically focus on a single task and rely on full-parameter fine-tuning, which makes them prone to overfitting on specific modalities or task types, thereby limiting their generalization capacity and transferability. To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart. Overall, our work lays a cornerstone for advancing toward the foundation LMM for VQualA.</description>

      <title>X-ReID: Multi-granularity Information Interaction for Video-Based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have recently achieved remarkable performance in retrieval tasks, yet their potential for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) remains largely unexplored. The primary challenges are narrowing the modality gap and leveraging spatiotemporal information in video sequences. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality feature learning framework named X-ReID for VVI-ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Cross-modality Prototype Collaboration (CPC) to align and integrate features from different modalities, guiding the network to reduce the modality discrepancy. Then, a Multi-granularity Information Interaction (MII) is designed, incorporating short-term interactions from adjacent frames, long-term cross-frame information fusion, and cross-modality feature alignment to enhance temporal modeling and further reduce modality gaps. Finally, by integrating multi-granularity information, a robust sequence-level representation is achieved. Extensive experiments on two large-scale VVI-ReID benchmarks (i.e., HITSZ-VCM and BUPTCampus) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Signal: Selective Interaction and Global-local Alignment for Multi-Modal Object Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) is devoted to retrieving specific objects through the exploitation of complementary multi-modal image information. Existing methods mainly concentrate on the fusion of multi-modal features, yet neglecting the background interference. Besides, current multi-modal fusion methods often focus on aligning modality pairs but suffer from multi-modal consistency alignment. To address these issues, we propose a novel selective interaction and global-local alignment framework called Signal for multi-modal object ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Selective Interaction Module (SIM) to select important patch tokens with intra-modal and inter-modal information. These important patch tokens engage in the interaction with class tokens, thereby yielding more discriminative features. Then, we propose a Global Alignment Module (GAM) to simultaneously align multi-modal features by minimizing the volume of 3D polyhedra in the gramian space. Meanwhile, we propose a Local Alignment Module (LAM) to align local features in a shift-aware manner. With these modules, our proposed framework could extract more discriminative features for object ReID. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) validate the effectiveness of our method.

      <title>CADTrack: Learning Contextual Aggregation with Deformable Alignment for Robust RGBT Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGBT) tracking aims to exploit visible and thermal infrared modalities for robust all-weather object tracking. However, existing RGBT trackers struggle to resolve modality discrepancies, which poses great challenges for robust feature representation. This limitation hinders effective cross-modal information propagation and fusion, which significantly reduces the tracking accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Contextual Aggregation with Deformable Alignment framework called CADTrack for RGBT Tracking. To be specific, we first deploy the Mamba-based Feature Interaction (MFI) that establishes efficient feature interaction via state space models. This interaction module can operate with linear complexity, reducing computational cost and improving feature discrimination. Then, we propose the Contextual Aggregation Module (CAM) that dynamically activates backbone layers through sparse gating based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). This module can encode complementary contextual information from cross-layer features. Finally, we propose the Deformable Alignment Module (DAM) to integrate deformable sampling and temporal propagation, mitigating spatial misalignment and localization drift. With the above components, our CADTrack achieves robust and accurate tracking in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on five RGBT tracking benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is released at https://github.com/IdolLab/CADTrack.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Pseudo-replay for Exemplar-free Class-incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) aims to retain old knowledge acquired in the previous task while learning new classes, without storing the previous images due to storage constraints or privacy concerns. In EFCIL, the plasticity-stability dilemma, learning new tasks versus catastrophic forgetting, is a significant challenge, primarily due to the unavailability of images from earlier tasks. In this paper, we introduce adversarial pseudo-replay (APR), a method that perturbs the images of the new task with adversarial attack, to synthesize the pseudo-replay images online without storing any replay samples. During the new task training, the adversarial attack is conducted on the new task images with augmented old class mean prototypes as targets, and the resulting images are used for knowledge distillation to prevent semantic drift. Moreover, we calibrate the covariance matrices to compensate for the semantic drift after each task, by learning a transfer matrix on the pseudo-replay samples. Our method reconciles stability and plasticity, achieving state-of-the-art on challenging cold-start settings of the standard EFCIL benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FeRA: Frequency-Energy Constrained Routing for Effective Diffusion Adaptation Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, yet how to effectively adapt large pretrained models to new tasks remains challenging. We revisit the reconstruction behavior of diffusion models during denoising to unveil the underlying frequency energy mechanism governing this process. Building upon this observation, we propose FeRA, a frequency driven fine tuning framework that aligns parameter updates with the intrinsic frequency energy progression of diffusion. FeRA establishes a comprehensive frequency energy framework for effective diffusion adaptation fine tuning, comprising three synergistic components: (i) a compact frequency energy indicator that characterizes the latent bandwise energy distribution, (ii) a soft frequency router that adaptively fuses multiple frequency specific adapter experts, and (iii) a frequency energy consistency regularization that stabilizes diffusion optimization and ensures coherent adaptation across bands. Routing operates in both training and inference, with inference time routing dynamically determined by the latent frequency energy. It integrates seamlessly with adapter based tuning schemes and generalizes well across diffusion backbones and resolutions. By aligning adaptation with the frequency energy mechanism, FeRA provides a simple, stable, and compatible paradigm for effective and robust diffusion model adaptation.</description>

      <title>Plan-X: Instruct Video Generation via Semantic Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual synthesis, yet they often struggle with high-level semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. This limitation frequently leads to visual hallucinations and mis-alignments with user instructions, especially in scenarios involving complex scene understanding, human-object interactions, multi-stage actions, and in-context motion reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured "semantic sketches" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially reduces visual hallucinations and enables fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with multimodal context.</description>

      <title>HyM-UNet: Synergizing Local Texture and Global Context via Hybrid CNN-Mamba Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate organ and lesion segmentation is a critical prerequisite for computer-aided diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), constrained by their local receptive fields, often struggle to capture complex global anatomical structures. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hybrid architecture, HyM-UNet, designed to synergize the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the efficient global modeling capabilities of Mamba. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that utilizes convolutional modules in the shallow stages to preserve high-frequency texture details, while introducing Visual Mamba modules in the deep stages to capture long-range semantic dependencies with linear complexity. To bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and the decoder, we propose a Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection (MGF-Skip). This module leverages deep semantic features as gating signals to dynamically suppress background noise within shallow features, thereby enhancing the perception of ambiguous boundaries. We conduct extensive experiments on public benchmark dataset ISIC 2018. The results demonstrate that HyM-UNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice coefficient and IoU, while maintaining lower parameter counts and inference latency. This validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in handling medical segmentation tasks characterized by complex shapes and scale variations.</description>

      <title>SD-PSFNet: Sequential and Dynamic Point Spread Function Network for Image Deraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for vision applications but is challenged by the complex multi-scale physics of rain and its coupling with scenes. To address this challenge, a novel approach inspired by multi-stage image restoration is proposed, incorporating Point Spread Function (PSF) mechanisms to reveal the image degradation process while combining dynamic physical modeling with sequential feature fusion transfer, named SD-PSFNet. Specifically, SD-PSFNet employs a sequential restoration architecture with three cascaded stages, allowing multiple dynamic evaluations and refinements of the degradation process estimation. The network utilizes components with learned PSF mechanisms to dynamically simulate rain streak optics, enabling effective rain-background separation while progressively enhancing outputs through novel PSF components at each stage. Additionally, SD-PSFNet incorporates adaptive gated fusion for optimal cross-stage feature integration, enabling sequential refinement from coarse rain removal to fine detail restoration. Our model achieves state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM metrics on Rain100H (33.12dB/0.9371), RealRain-1k-L (42.28dB/0.9872), and RealRain-1k-H (41.08dB/0.9838). In summary, SD-PSFNet demonstrates excellent capability in complex scenes and dense rainfall conditions, providing a new physics-aware approach to image deraining.</description>

      <title>RAISECity: A Multimodal Agent Framework for Reality-Aligned 3D World Generation at City-Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: City-scale 3D generation is of great importance for the development of embodied intelligence and world models. Existing methods, however, face significant challenges regarding quality, fidelity, and scalability in 3D world generation. Thus, we propose RAISECity, a \textbf{R}eality-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{I}ntelligent \textbf{S}ynthesis \textbf{E}ngine that creates detailed, \textbf{C}ity-scale 3D worlds. We introduce an agentic framework that leverages diverse multimodal foundation tools to acquire real-world knowledge, maintain robust intermediate representations, and construct complex 3D scenes. This agentic design, featuring dynamic data processing, iterative self-reflection and refinement, and the invocation of advanced multimodal tools, minimizes cumulative errors and enhances overall performance. Extensive quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses validate the superior performance of RAISECity in real-world alignment, shape precision, texture fidelity, and aesthetics level, achieving over a 90% win-rate against existing baselines for overall perceptual quality. This combination of 3D quality, reality alignment, scalability, and seamless compatibility with computer graphics pipelines makes RAISECity a promising foundation for applications in immersive media, embodied intelligence, and world models.</description>

      <title>Is Complete Labeling Necessary? Understanding Active Learning in Longitudinal Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting changes in longitudinal medical imaging using deep learning requires a substantial amount of accurately labeled data. However, labeling these images is notably more costly and time-consuming than labeling other image types, as it requires labeling across various time points, where new lesions can be minor, and subtle changes are easily missed. Deep Active Learning (DAL) has shown promise in minimizing labeling costs by selectively querying the most informative samples, but existing studies have primarily focused on static tasks like classification and segmentation. Consequently, the conventional DAL approach cannot be directly applied to change detection tasks, which involve identifying subtle differences across multiple images. In this study, we propose a novel DAL framework, named Longitudinal Medical Imaging Active Learning (LMI-AL), tailored specifically for longitudinal medical imaging. By pairing and differencing all 2D slices from baseline and follow-up 3D images, LMI-AL iteratively selects the most informative pairs for labeling using DAL, training a deep learning model with minimal manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that, with less than 8% of the data labeled, LMI-AL can achieve performance comparable to models trained on fully labeled datasets. We also provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance, as guidance for future research. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HelenMa9998/Longitudinal_AL.</description>

      <title>RoadBench: Benchmarking MLLMs on Fine-Grained Spatial Understanding and Reasoning under Urban Road Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in general spatial understanding and reasoning. However, their fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities in complex urban scenarios have not received significant attention in the fields of both research and industry. To fill this gap, we focus primarily on road markings as a typical example of fine-grained spatial elements under urban scenarios, given the essential role of the integrated road traffic network they form within cities. Around road markings and urban traffic systems, we propose RoadBench, a systematic benchmark that comprehensively evaluates MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities using BEV and FPV image inputs. This benchmark comprises six tasks consisting of 9,121 strictly manually verified test cases. These tasks form a systematic evaluation framework that bridges understanding at local spatial scopes to global reasoning. They not only test MLLMs' capabilities in recognition, joint understanding, and reasoning but also assess their ability to integrate image information with domain knowledge. After evaluating 14 mainstream MLLMs, we confirm that RoadBench is a challenging benchmark for MLLMs while revealing significant shortcomings in existing MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities within urban scenarios. In certain tasks, their performance even falls short of simple rule-based or random selection baselines. These findings, along with RoadBench itself, will contribute to the comprehensive advancement of spatial understanding capabilities for MLLMs. The benchmark code, example datasets, and raw evaluation results are available in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>State and Scene Enhanced Prototypes for Weakly Supervised Open-Vocabulary Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to generalize object recognition to novel categories, while Weakly Supervised OVOD (WS-OVOD) extends this by combining box-level annotations with image-level labels. Despite recent progress, two critical challenges persist in this setting. First, existing semantic prototypes, even when enriched by LLMs, are static and limited, failing to capture the rich intra-class visual variations induced by different object states (e.g., a cat's pose). Second, the standard pseudo-box generation introduces a semantic mismatch between visual region proposals (which contain context) and object-centric text embeddings. To tackle these issues, we introduce two complementary prototype enhancement strategies. To capture intra-class variations in appearance and state, we propose the State-Enhanced Semantic Prototypes (SESP), which generates state-aware textual descriptions (e.g., "a sleeping cat") to capture diverse object appearances, yielding more discriminative prototypes. Building on this, we further introduce Scene-Augmented Pseudo Prototypes (SAPP) to address the semantic mismatch. SAPP incorporates contextual semantics (e.g., "cat lying on sofa") and utilizes a soft alignment mechanism to promote contextually consistent visual-textual representations. By integrating SESP and SAPP, our method effectively enhances both the richness of semantic prototypes and the visual-textual alignment, achieving notable improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) and Closed-form Continuous-time Networks (CfCs) for modeling retinal ganglion cell activity in tiger salamanders across three datasets. Compared to a convolutional baseline and an LSTM, both architectures achieved lower MAE, faster convergence, smaller model sizes, and favorable query times, though with slightly lower Pearson correlation. Their efficiency and adaptability make them well suited for scenarios with limited data and frequent retraining, such as edge deployments in vision prosthetics.</description>

      <title>MambaX: Image Super-Resolution with State Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) is a critical technology for overcoming the inherent hardware limitations of sensors. However, existing approaches mainly focus on directly enhancing the final resolution, often neglecting effective control over error propagation and accumulation during intermediate stages. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising approach that can represent the entire reconstruction process as a state sequence with multiple nodes, allowing for intermediate intervention. Nonetheless, its fixed linear mapper is limited by a narrow receptive field and restricted flexibility, which hampers its effectiveness in fine-grained images. To address this, we created a nonlinear state predictive control model \textbf{MambaX} that maps consecutive spectral bands into a latent state space and generalizes the SR task by dynamically learning the nonlinear state parameters of control equations. Compared to existing sequence models, MambaX 1) employs dynamic state predictive control learning to approximate the nonlinear differential coefficients of state-space models; 2) introduces a novel state cross-control paradigm for multimodal SR fusion; and 3) utilizes progressive transitional learning to mitigate heterogeneity caused by domain and modality shifts. Our evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of the dynamic spectrum-state representation model in both single-image SR and multimodal fusion-based SR tasks, highlighting its substantial potential to advance spectrally generalized modeling across arbitrary dimensions and modalities.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Event Frame Sensors: Modeling, Calibration, and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event frame hybrid sensors integrate an Active Pixel Sensor (APS) and an Event Vision Sensor (EVS) within a single chip, combining the high dynamic range and low latency of the EVS with the rich spatial intensity information from the APS. While this tight integration offers compact, temporally precise imaging, the complex circuit architecture introduces non-trivial noise patterns that remain poorly understood and unmodeled. In this work, we present the first unified, statistics-based imaging noise model that jointly describes the noise behavior of APS and EVS pixels. Our formulation explicitly incorporates photon shot noise, dark current noise, fixed-pattern noise, and quantization noise, and links EVS noise to illumination level and dark current. Based on this formulation, we further develop a calibration pipeline to estimate noise parameters from real data and offer a detailed analysis of both APS and EVS noise behaviors. Finally, we propose HESIM, a statistically grounded simulator that generates RAW frames and events under realistic, jointly calibrated noise statistics. Experiments on two hybrid sensors validate our model across multiple imaging tasks (e.g., video frame interpolation and deblurring), demonstrating strong transfer from simulation to real data.</description>

      <title>UltraFlux: Data-Model Co-Design for High-quality Native 4K Text-to-Image Generation across Diverse Aspect Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers have recently delivered strong text-to-image generation around 1K resolution, but we show that extending them to native 4K across diverse aspect ratios exposes a tightly coupled failure mode spanning positional encoding, VAE compression, and optimization. Tackling any of these factors in isolation leaves substantial quality on the table. We therefore take a data-model co-design view and introduce UltraFlux, a Flux-based DiT trained natively at 4K on MultiAspect-4K-1M, a 1M-image 4K corpus with controlled multi-AR coverage, bilingual captions, and rich VLM/IQA metadata for resolution- and AR-aware sampling. On the model side, UltraFlux couples (i) Resonance 2D RoPE with YaRN for training-window-, frequency-, and AR-aware positional encoding at 4K; (ii) a simple, non-adversarial VAE post-training scheme that improves 4K reconstruction fidelity; (iii) an SNR-Aware Huber Wavelet objective that rebalances gradients across timesteps and frequency bands; and (iv) a Stage-wise Aesthetic Curriculum Learning strategy that concentrates high-aesthetic supervision on high-noise steps governed by the model prior. Together, these components yield a stable, detail-preserving 4K DiT that generalizes across wide, square, and tall ARs. On the Aesthetic-Eval at 4096 benchmark and multi-AR 4K settings, UltraFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines across fidelity, aesthetic, and alignment metrics, and-with a LLM prompt refiner-matches or surpasses the proprietary Seedream 4.0.</description>

      <title>IE-Critic-R1: Advancing the Explanatory Measurement of Text-Driven Image Editing for Human Perception Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven image editing have been significant, yet the task of accurately evaluating these edited images continues to pose a considerable challenge. Different from the assessment of text-driven image generation, text-driven image editing is characterized by simultaneously conditioning on both text and a source image. The edited images often retain an intrinsic connection to the original image, which dynamically change with the semantics of the text. However, previous methods tend to solely focus on text-image alignment or have not well aligned with human perception. In this work, we introduce the Text-driven Image Editing Benchmark suite (IE-Bench) to enhance the assessment of text-driven edited images. IE-Bench includes a database contains diverse source images, various editing prompts and the corresponding edited results from different editing methods, and nearly 4,000 samples with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided by 15 human subjects. Furthermore, we introduce IE-Critic-R1, which, benefiting from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), provides more comprehensive and explainable quality assessment for text-driven image editing that aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate IE-Critic-R1's superior subjective-alignments on the text-driven image editing task compared with previous metrics. Related data and codes are available to the public.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning for Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of deep learning models in remote sensing (RS) strongly depends on the availability of high-quality labeled data. However, collecting large-scale annotations is costly and time-consuming, while vast amounts of unlabeled imagery remain underutilized. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning (HSSAL) framework that integrates semi-supervised learning (SSL) and a novel hierarchical active learning (HAL) in a closed iterative loop. In each iteration, SSL refines the model using both labeled data through supervised learning and unlabeled data via weak-to-strong self-training, improving feature representation and uncertainty estimation. Guided by the refined representations and uncertainty cues of unlabeled samples, HAL then conducts sample querying through a progressive clustering strategy, selecting the most informative instances that jointly satisfy the criteria of scalability, diversity, and uncertainty. This hierarchical process ensures both efficiency and representativeness in sample selection. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS scene classification datasets, including UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, demonstrate that HSSAL consistently outperforms SSL- or AL-only baselines. Remarkably, with only 8%, 4%, and 2% labeled training data on UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, respectively, HSSAL achieves over 95% of fully-supervised accuracy, highlighting its superior label efficiency through informativeness exploitation of unlabeled data. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/RS-SSAL.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight, Interpretable Deep Learning System for Automated Detection of Cervical Adenocarcinoma In Situ (AIS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is a critical premalignant lesion whose accurate histopathological diagnosis is challenging. Early detection is essential to prevent progression to invasive cervical adenocarcinoma. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based virtual pathology assistant capable of distinguishing AIS from normal cervical gland histology using the CAISHI dataset, which contains 2240 expert-labeled H&amp;E images (1010 normal and 1230 AIS). All images underwent Macenko stain normalization and patch-based preprocessing to enhance morphological feature representation. An EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network was trained using class-balanced sampling and focal loss to address dataset imbalance and emphasize difficult examples. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.7323, with an F1-score of 0.75 for the Abnormal class and 0.71 for the Normal class. Grad-CAM heatmaps demonstrated biologically interpretable activation patterns, highlighting nuclear atypia and glandular crowding consistent with AIS morphology. The trained model was deployed in a Gradio-based virtual diagnostic assistant. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight, interpretable AI systems for cervical gland pathology, with potential applications in screening workflows, education, and low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>VK-Det: Visual Knowledge Guided Prototype Learning for Open-Vocabulary Aerial Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To identify objects beyond predefined categories, open-vocabulary aerial object detection (OVAD) leverages the zero-shot capabilities of visual-language models (VLMs) to generalize from base to novel categories. Existing approaches typically utilize self-learning mechanisms with weak text supervision to generate region-level pseudo-labels to align detectors with VLMs semantic spaces. However, text dependence induces semantic bias, restricting open-vocabulary expansion to text-specified concepts. We propose $\textbf{VK-Det}$, a $\textbf{V}$isual $\textbf{K}$nowledge-guided open-vocabulary object $\textbf{Det}$ection framework $\textit{without}$ extra supervision. First, we discover and leverage vision encoder's inherent informative region perception to attain fine-grained localization and adaptive distillation. Second, we introduce a novel prototype-aware pseudo-labeling strategy. It models inter-class decision boundaries through feature clustering and maps detection regions to latent categories via prototype matching. This enhances attention to novel objects while compensating for missing supervision. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance, achieving 30.1 $\mathrm{mAP}^{N}$ on DIOR and 23.3 $\mathrm{mAP}^{N}$ on DOTA, outperforming even extra supervised methods.</description>

      <title>ActDistill: General Action-Guided Self-Derived Distillation for Efficient Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive flexibility and generalization, yet their deployment in robotic manipulation remains limited by heavy computational overhead and inference latency. In this work, we present ActDistill, a general action-guided self-derived distillation framework that transfers the action prediction capability of any existing VLA model to a lightweight counterpart. Unlike previous efficiency strategies that primarily emphasize vision-language correlations, ActDistill leverages action priors to guide knowledge transfer and model compression, achieving action-oriented efficiency for VLA models. Specifically, we employ a well-trained VLA model as the teacher and introduce a graph-structured encapsulation strategy to explicitly model the hierarchical evolution of action prediction. The student model, derived from the graph-encapsulated teacher, is further equipped with a dynamic router that adaptively selects computation paths based on action prediction demands, guided by hierarchical graph-informed supervision to ensure smooth and efficient evolution. During inference, graph-related auxiliary components are removed, allowing the student to execute only dynamically routed layers and predict high-precision actions with minimal computation and latency. Experiments on embodied benchmarks demonstrate that ActDistill achieves comparable or superior performance to full-scale VLA models while reducing computation by over 50% with up to 1.67 times speedup, thereby establishing a general paradigm toward efficient embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>Less Is More: An Explainable AI Framework for Lightweight Malaria Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Objective: Deep learning models have high computational needs and lack interpretability but are often the first choice for medical image classification tasks. This study addresses whether complex neural networks are essential for the simple binary classification task of malaria. We introduce the Extracted Morphological Feature Engineered (EMFE) pipeline, a transparent, reproducible, and low compute machine learning approach tailored explicitly for simple cell morphology, designed to achieve deep learning performance levels on a simple CPU only setup with the practical aim of real world deployment.
  Methods: The study used the NIH Malaria Cell Images dataset, with two features extracted from each cell image: the number of non background pixels and the number of holes within the cell. Logistic Regression and Random Forest were compared against ResNet18, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet across accuracy, model size, and CPU inference time. An ensemble model was created by combining Logistic Regression and Random Forests to achieve higher accuracy while retaining efficiency.
  Results: The single variable Logistic Regression model achieved a test accuracy of 94.80 percent with a file size of 1.2 kB and negligible inference latency (2.3 ms). The two stage ensemble improved accuracy to 97.15 percent. In contrast, the deep learning methods require 13.6 MB to 44.7 MB of storage and show significantly higher inference times (68 ms).
  Conclusion: This study shows that a compact feature engineering approach can produce clinically meaningful classification performance while offering gains in transparency, reproducibility, speed, and deployment feasibility. The proposed pipeline demonstrates that simple interpretable features paired with lightweight models can serve as a practical diagnostic solution for environments with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Together, Then Apart: Revisiting Multimodal Survival Analysis via a Min-Max Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating heterogeneous modalities such as histopathology and genomics is central to advancing survival analysis, yet most existing methods prioritize cross-modal alignment through attention-based fusion mechanisms, often at the expense of modality-specific characteristics. This overemphasis on alignment leads to representation collapse and reduced diversity. In this work, we revisit multi-modal survival analysis via the dual lens of alignment and distinctiveness, positing that preserving modality-specific structure is as vital as achieving semantic coherence. In this paper, we introduce Together-Then-Apart (TTA), a unified min-max optimization framework that simultaneously models shared and modality-specific representations. The Together stage minimizes semantic discrepancies by aligning embeddings via shared prototypes, guided by an unbalanced optimal transport objective that adaptively highlights informative tokens. The Apart stage maximizes representational diversity through modality anchors and a contrastive regularizer that preserve unique modality information and prevent feature collapse. Extensive experiments on five TCGA benchmarks show that TTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Beyond empirical gains, our formulation provides a new theoretical perspective of how alignment and distinctiveness can be jointly achieved in for robust, interpretable, and biologically meaningful multi-modal survival analysis.</description>

      <title>Versatile Recompression-Aware Perceptual Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perceptual image super-resolution (SR) methods restore degraded images and produce sharp outputs. In practice, those outputs are usually recompressed for storage and transmission. Ignoring recompression is suboptimal as the downstream codec might add additional artifacts to restored images. However, jointly optimizing SR and recompression is challenging, as the codecs are not differentiable and vary in configuration. In this paper, we present Versatile Recompression-Aware Perceptual Super-Resolution (VRPSR), which makes existing perceptual SR aware of versatile compression. First, we formulate compression as conditional text-to-image generation and utilize a pre-trained diffusion model to build a generalizable codec simulator. Next, we propose a set of training techniques tailored for perceptual SR, including optimizing the simulator using perceptual targets and adopting slightly compressed images as the training target. Empirically, our VRPSR saves more than 10\% bitrate based on Real-ESRGAN and S3Diff under H.264/H.265/H.266 compression. Besides, our VRPSR facilitates joint optimization of the SR and post-processing model after recompression.</description>

      <title>Spotlight: Identifying and Localizing Video Generation Errors Using VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current text-to-video models (T2V) can generate high-quality, temporally coherent, and visually realistic videos. Nonetheless, errors still often occur, and are more nuanced and local compared to the previous generation of T2V models. While current evaluation paradigms assess video models across diverse dimensions, they typically evaluate videos holistically without identifying when specific errors occur or describing their nature. We address this gap by introducing Spotlight, a novel task aimed at localizing and explaining video-generation errors. We generate 600 videos using 200 diverse textual prompts and three state-of-the-art video generators (Veo 3, Seedance, and LTX-2), and annotate over 1600 fine-grained errors across six types, including motion, physics, and prompt adherence. We observe that adherence and physics errors are predominant and persist across longer segments, whereas appearance-disappearance and body pose errors manifest in shorter segments. We then evaluate current VLMs on Spotlight and find that VLMs lag significantly behind humans in error identification and localization in videos. We propose inference-time strategies to probe the limits of current VLMs on our task, improving performance by nearly 2x. Our task paves a way forward to building fine-grained evaluation tools and more sophisticated reward models for video generators.</description>

      <title>Consolidating Diffusion-Generated Video Detection with Unified Multimodal Forgery Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of videos generated by diffusion models has raised increasing concerns about information security, highlighting the urgent need for reliable detection of synthetic media. Existing methods primarily focus on image-level forgery detection, leaving generic video-level forgery detection largely underexplored. To advance video forensics, we propose a consolidated multimodal detection algorithm, named MM-Det++, specifically designed for detecting diffusion-generated videos. Our approach consists of two innovative branches and a Unified Multimodal Learning (UML) module. Specifically, the Spatio-Temporal (ST) branch employs a novel Frame-Centric Vision Transformer (FC-ViT) to aggregate spatio-temporal information for detecting diffusion-generated videos, where the FC-tokens enable the capture of holistic forgery traces from each video frame. In parallel, the Multimodal (MM) branch adopts a learnable reasoning paradigm to acquire Multimodal Forgery Representation (MFR) by harnessing the powerful comprehension and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which discerns the forgery traces from a flexible semantic perspective. To integrate multimodal representations into a coherent space, a UML module is introduced to consolidate the generalization ability of MM-Det++. In addition, we also establish a large-scale and comprehensive Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF) dataset to advance research in video forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MM-Det++ and highlight the effectiveness of unified multimodal forgery learning in detecting diffusion-generated videos.</description>

      <title>AdaPerceiver: Transformers with Adaptive Width, Depth, and Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern transformer architectures achieve remarkable performance across tasks and domains but remain rigid in how they allocate computation at inference time. Real-world deployment often requires models to adapt to diverse hardware and latency constraints, yet most approaches to dynamic computation focus on a single axis -- such as reducing the number of tokens. We present a novel capability: AdaPerceiver, the first transformer architecture with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens within a single model. We propose an architecture that supports adaptivity along these axes. We couple this with an efficient joint training regime that ensures the model maintains performance across its various configurations. We evaluate AdaPerceiver on image classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation tasks. On image classification, AdaPerceiver expands the accuracy-throughput Pareto front. It achieves 85.4% accuracy while yielding 36% higher throughput than FlexiViT-L. On dense prediction, AdaPerceiver matches ViT-H/14 while having $\sim$26x fewer encoder FLOPs (floating-point operations) on semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Finally, we show how AdaPerceiver equipped with a policy can maintain ImageNet1K accuracy ($\pm0.1$ percentage points) while reducing FLOPs by $24-33$%.</description>

      <title>Muskie: Multi-view Masked Image Modeling for 3D Vision Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Muskie, a native multi-view vision backbone designed for 3D vision tasks. Unlike existing models, which are frame-wise and exhibit limited multi-view consistency, Muskie is designed to process multiple views simultaneously and introduce multi-view consistency in pre-training stage. Muskie is trained to reconstruct heavily masked content in one view by finding and utilizing geometric correspondences from other views. Through this pretext task and our proposed aggressive masking strategy, the model implicitly to learn view-invariant features and develop strong geometric understanding without any 3D supervision. Compared with state-of-the-art frame-wise backbones such as DINO, Muskie achieves higher multi-view correspondence accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using Muskie as a backbone consistently enhances performance on downstream 3D tasks, including camera pose estimation and pointmap reconstruction.

      <title>PromptMoE: Generalizable Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection via Visually-Guided Prompt Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) aims to identify and localize anomalous regions in images of unseen object classes. While recent methods based on vision-language models like CLIP show promise, their performance is constrained by existing prompt engineering strategies. Current approaches, whether relying on single fixed, learnable, or dense dynamic prompts, suffer from a representational bottleneck and are prone to overfitting on auxiliary data, failing to generalize to the complexity and diversity of unseen anomalies. To overcome these limitations, we propose $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$. Our core insight is that robust ZSAD requires a compositional approach to prompt learning. Instead of learning monolithic prompts, $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$ learns a pool of expert prompts, which serve as a basis set of composable semantic primitives, and a visually-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically combine them for each instance. Our framework materializes this concept through a Visually-Guided Mixture of Prompt (VGMoP) that employs an image-gated sparse MoE to aggregate diverse normal and abnormal expert state prompts, generating semantically rich textual representations with strong generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets in industrial and medical domains demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$.</description>

      <title>MVS-TTA: Test-Time Adaptation for Multi-View Stereo via Meta-Auxiliary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods are data-driven and have achieved remarkable progress due to large-scale training data and advanced architectures. However, their generalization remains sub-optimal due to fixed model parameters trained on limited training data distributions. In contrast, optimization-based methods enable scene-specific adaptation but lack scalability and require costly per-scene optimization. In this paper, we propose MVS-TTA, an efficient test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enhances the adaptability of learning-based MVS methods by bridging these two paradigms. Specifically, MVS-TTA employs a self-supervised, cross-view consistency loss as an auxiliary task to guide inference-time adaptation. We introduce a meta-auxiliary learning strategy to train the model to benefit from auxiliary-task-based updates explicitly. Our framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of MVS methods with minimal architectural changes. Extensive experiments on standard datasets (DTU, BlendedMVS) and a challenging cross-dataset generalization setting demonstrate that MVS-TTA consistently improves performance, even when applied to state-of-the-art MVS models. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate optimization-based test-time adaptation into learning-based MVS using meta-learning. The code will be available at https://github.com/mart87987-svg/MVS-TTA.</description>

      <title>VCU-Bridge: Hierarchical Visual Connotation Understanding via Semantic Bridging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmarks, their processing paradigm differs from the human ability to integrate visual information. Unlike humans who naturally bridge details and high-level concepts, models tend to treat these elements in isolation. Prevailing evaluation protocols often decouple low-level perception from high-level reasoning, overlooking their semantic and causal dependencies, which yields non-diagnostic results and obscures performance bottlenecks. We present VCU-Bridge, a framework that operationalizes a human-like hierarchy of visual connotation understanding: multi-level reasoning that advances from foundational perception through semantic bridging to abstract connotation, with an explicit evidence-to-inference trace from concrete cues to abstract conclusions. Building on this framework, we construct HVCU-Bench, a benchmark for hierarchical visual connotation understanding with explicit, level-wise diagnostics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a consistent decline in performance as reasoning progresses to higher levels. We further develop a data generation pipeline for instruction tuning guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and show that strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels. Interestingly, it not only improves on HVCU-Bench but also brings benefits on general benchmarks (average +2.53%), especially with substantial gains on MMStar (+7.26%), demonstrating the significance of the hierarchical thinking pattern and its effectiveness in enhancing MLLM capabilities.

      <title>Bias Is a Subspace, Not a Coordinate: A Geometric Rethinking of Post-hoc Debiasing in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become indispensable for multimodal reasoning, yet their representations often encode and amplify demographic biases, resulting in biased associations and misaligned predictions in downstream tasks. Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{S}$ubspace $\textbf{P}$rojection $\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.</description>

      <title>SFHand: A Streaming Framework for Language-guided 3D Hand Forecasting and Embodied Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time 3D hand forecasting is a critical component for fluid human-computer interaction in applications like AR and assistive robotics. However, existing methods are ill-suited for these scenarios, as they typically require offline access to accumulated video sequences and cannot incorporate language guidance that conveys task intent. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SFHand, the first streaming framework for language-guided 3D hand forecasting. SFHand autoregressively predicts a comprehensive set of future 3D hand states, including hand type, 2D bounding box, 3D pose, and trajectory, from a continuous stream of video and language instructions. Our framework combines a streaming autoregressive architecture with an ROI-enhanced memory layer, capturing temporal context while focusing on salient hand-centric regions. To enable this research, we also introduce EgoHaFL, the first large-scale dataset featuring synchronized 3D hand poses and language instructions. We demonstrate that SFHand achieves new state-of-the-art results in 3D hand forecasting, outperforming prior work by a significant margin of up to 35.8%. Furthermore, we show the practical utility of our learned representations by transferring them to downstream embodied manipulation tasks, improving task success rates by up to 13.4% on multiple benchmarks.

      <title>Video4Edit: Viewing Image Editing as a Degenerate Temporal Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that recent advances in multimodal foundation models have propelled instruction-driven image generation and editing into a genuinely cross-modal, cooperative regime. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art editing pipelines remain costly: beyond training large diffusion/flow models, they require curating massive high-quality triplets of \{instruction, source image, edited image\} to cover diverse user intents. Moreover, the fidelity of visual replacements hinges on how precisely the instruction references the target semantics. We revisit this challenge through the lens of temporal modeling: if video can be regarded as a full temporal process, then image editing can be seen as a degenerate temporal process. This perspective allows us to transfer single-frame evolution priors from video pre-training, enabling a highly data-efficient fine-tuning regime. Empirically, our approach matches the performance of leading open-source baselines while using only about one percent of the supervision demanded by mainstream editing models.</description>

      <title>SCALER: SAM-Enhanced Collaborative Learning for Label-Deficient Concealed Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for label-deficient concealed object segmentation (LDCOS) either rely on consistency constraints or Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. However, their performance remains limited due to the intrinsic concealment of targets and the scarcity of annotations. This study investigates two key questions: (1) Can consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision be jointly integrated to better exploit complementary information and enhance the segmenter? and (2) beyond that, can the segmenter in turn guide SAM through reciprocal supervision, enabling mutual improvement? To answer these questions, we present SCALER, a unified collaborative framework toward LDCOS that jointly optimizes a mean-teacher segmenter and a learnable SAM. SCALER operates in two alternating phases. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}}, the segmenter is optimized under fixed SAM supervision using entropy-based image-level and uncertainty-based pixel-level weighting to select reliable pseudo-label regions and emphasize harder examples. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}}, SAM is updated via augmentation invariance and noise resistance losses, leveraging its inherent robustness to perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that SCALER yields consistent performance gains across eight semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks. The results further suggest that SCALER can serve as a general training paradigm to enhance both lightweight segmenters and large foundation models under label-scarce conditions. Code will be released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical imaging confronts an efficiency-resolution tradeoff that limits large-scale morphological classification and redshift prediction. We introduce WaveletMamba, a theory-driven framework integrating wavelet decomposition with state-space modeling, mathematical regularization, and multi-level bias correction. WaveletMamba achieves 81.72% +/- 0.53% classification accuracy at 64x64 resolution with only 3.54M parameters, delivering high-resolution performance (80.93% +/- 0.27% at 244x244) at low-resolution inputs with 9.7x computational efficiency gains. The framework exhibits Resolution Multistability, where models trained on low-resolution data achieve consistent accuracy across different input scales despite divergent internal representations. The framework's multi-level bias correction synergizes HK distance (distribution-level optimal transport) with Color-Aware Weighting (sample-level fine-tuning), achieving 22.96% Log-MSE improvement and 26.10% outlier reduction without explicit selection function modeling. Here, we show that mathematical rigor enables unprecedented efficiency and comprehensive bias correction in scientific AI, bridging computer vision and astrophysics to revolutionize interdisciplinary scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>UnfoldLDM: Deep Unfolding-based Blind Image Restoration with Latent Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) combine the interpretability of model-based methods with the learning ability of deep networks, yet remain limited for blind image restoration (BIR). Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Matching-Based Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation Models Are Interpretable by Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) models achieve strong performance in segmenting novel classes with minimal labeled examples, yet their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. While explainable AI has advanced significantly in standard computer vision tasks, interpretability in FSS remains virtually unexplored despite its critical importance for understanding model behavior and guiding support set selection in data-scarce scenarios. This paper introduces the first dedicated method for interpreting matching-based FSS models by leveraging their inherent structural properties. Our Affinity Explainer approach extracts attribution maps that highlight which pixels in support images contribute most to query segmentation predictions, using matching scores computed between support and query features at multiple feature levels. We extend standard interpretability evaluation metrics to the FSS domain and propose additional metrics to better capture the practical utility of explanations in few-shot scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on FSS benchmark datasets, using different models, demonstrate that our Affinity Explainer significantly outperforms adapted standard attribution methods. Qualitative analysis reveals that our explanations provide structured, coherent attention patterns that align with model architectures and and enable effective model diagnosis. This work establishes the foundation for interpretable FSS research, enabling better model understanding and diagnostic for more reliable few-shot segmentation systems.

      <title>Nested Unfolding Network for Real-World Concealed Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have recently advanced concealed object segmentation (COS) by modeling segmentation as iterative foreground-background separation. However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>EgoControl: Controllable Egocentric Video Generation via 3D Full-Body Poses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Egocentric video generation with fine-grained control through body motion is a key requirement towards embodied AI agents that can simulate, predict, and plan actions. In this work, we propose EgoControl, a pose-controllable video diffusion model trained on egocentric data. We train a video prediction model to condition future frame generation on explicit 3D body pose sequences. To achieve precise motion control, we introduce a novel pose representation that captures both global camera dynamics and articulated body movements, and integrate it through a dedicated control mechanism within the diffusion process. Given a short sequence of observed frames and a sequence of target poses, EgoControl generates temporally coherent and visually realistic future frames that align with the provided pose control. Experimental results demonstrate that EgoControl produces high-quality, pose-consistent egocentric videos, paving the way toward controllable embodied video simulation and understanding.</description>

      <title>Unified Spherical Frontend: Learning Rotation-Equivariant Representations of Spherical Images from Any Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern perception increasingly relies on fisheye, panoramic, and other wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, yet most pipelines still apply planar CNNs designed for pinhole imagery on 2D grids, where image-space neighborhoods misrepresent physical adjacency and models are sensitive to global rotations. Frequency-domain spherical CNNs partially address this mismatch but require costly spherical harmonic transforms that constrain resolution and efficiency. We introduce the Unified Spherical Frontend (USF), a lens-agnostic framework that transforms images from any calibrated camera into a unit-sphere representation via ray-direction correspondences, and performs spherical resampling, convolution, and pooling directly in the spatial domain. USF is modular: projection, location sampling, interpolation, and resolution control are fully decoupled. Its distance-only spherical kernels offer configurable rotation-equivariance (mirroring translation-equivariance in planar CNNs) while avoiding harmonic transforms entirely. We compare standard planar backbones with their spherical counterparts across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on synthetic (Spherical MNIST) and real-world datasets (PANDORA, Stanford 2D-3D-S), and stress-test robustness to extreme lens distortions, varying FoV, and arbitrary rotations. USF processes high-resolution spherical imagery efficiently and maintains less than 1% performance drop under random test-time rotations, even without rotational augmentation, and even enables zero-shot generalization from one lens type to unseen wide-FoV lenses with minimal performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Early Lung Cancer Diagnosis from Virtual Follow-up LDCT Generation via Correlational Autoencoder and Latent Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and early diagnosis is critical because the survival rate declines sharply once the disease progresses to advanced stages. However, achieving an early diagnosis remains challenging, particularly in distinguishing subtle early signals of malignancy from those of benign conditions. In clinical practice, a patient with a high risk may need to undergo an initial baseline and several annual follow-up examinations (e.g., CT scans) before receiving a definitive diagnosis, which can result in missing the optimal treatment. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been increasingly used for early diagnosis of lung cancer, but most existing algorithms focus on radiomic features extraction from single early-stage CT scans. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models for image generation, this paper proposes a generative method, named CorrFlowNet, which creates a virtual, one-year follow-up CT scan after the initial baseline scan. This virtual follow-up would allow for an early detection of malignant/benign nodules, reducing the need to wait for clinical follow-ups. During training, our approach employs a correlational autoencoder to encode both early baseline and follow-up CT images into a latent space that captures the dynamics of nodule progression as well as the correlations between them, followed by a flow matching algorithm on the latent space with a neural ordinary differential equation. An auxiliary classifier is used to further enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Evaluations on a real clinical dataset show our method can significantly improve downstream lung nodule risk assessment compared with existing baseline models. Moreover, its diagnostic accuracy is comparable with real clinical CT follow-ups, highlighting its potential to improve cancer diagnosis.</description>

      <title>ARIAL: An Agentic Framework for Document VQA with Precise Answer Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.</description>

      <title>InfiniBench: Infinite Benchmarking for Visual Spatial Reasoning with Customizable Scene Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to have abilities of spatial reasoning with diverse scene complexities, but evaluating such abilities is difficult due to the lack of benchmarks that are not only diverse and scalable but also fully customizable. Existing benchmarks offer limited customizability over the scene complexity and are incapable of isolating and analyzing specific VLM failure modes under distinct spatial conditions. To address this gap, instead of individually presenting benchmarks for different scene complexities, in this paper we present InfiniBench, a fully automated, customizable and user-friendly benchmark generator that can synthesize a theoretically infinite variety of 3D scenes with parameterized control on scene complexity. InfiniBench uniquely translates scene descriptions in natural language into photo-realistic videos with complex and physically plausible 3D layouts. This is achieved through three key innovations: 1) a LLM-based agentic framework that iteratively refines procedural scene constraints from scene descriptions; 2) a flexible cluster-based layout optimizer that generates dense and cluttered scenes previously intractable for procedural methods; and 3) a task-aware camera trajectory optimization method that renders scenes into videos with full object coverage as VLM input. Experiments demonstrate that InfiniBench outperforms state-of-the-art procedural and LLM-based 3D generation methods in prompt fidelity and physical plausibility, especially in high-complexity scenarios. We further showcased the usefulness of InfiniBench, by generating benchmarks for representative spatial reasoning tasks including measurement, perspective-taking and spatiotemporal tracking.</description>

      <title>Generating Synthetic Human Blastocyst Images for In-Vitro Fertilization Blastocyst Grading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) at many clinics relies on the accurate morphological assessment of day 5 blastocysts, a process that is often subjective and inconsistent. While artificial intelligence can help standardize this evaluation, models require large, diverse, and balanced datasets, which are often unavailable due to data scarcity, natural class imbalance, and privacy constraints. Existing generative embryo models can mitigate these issues but face several limitations, such as poor image quality, small training datasets, non-robust evaluation, and lack of clinically relevant image generation for effective data augmentation. Here, we present the Diffusion Based Imaging Model for Artificial Blastocysts (DIA) framework, a set of latent diffusion models trained to generate high-fidelity, novel day 5 blastocyst images. Our models provide granular control by conditioning on Gardner-based morphological categories and z-axis focal depth. We rigorously evaluated the models using FID, a memorization metric, an embryologist Turing test, and three downstream classification tasks. Our results show that DIA models generate realistic images that embryologists could not reliably distinguish from real images. Most importantly, we demonstrated clear clinical value. Augmenting an imbalanced dataset with synthetic images significantly improved classification accuracy (p &lt; 0.05). Also, adding synthetic images to an already large, balanced dataset yielded statistically significant performance gains, and synthetic data could replace up to 40% of real data in some cases without a statistically significant loss in accuracy. DIA provides a robust solution for mitigating data scarcity and class imbalance in embryo datasets. By generating novel, high-fidelity, and controllable synthetic images, our models can improve the performance, fairness, and standardization of AI embryo assessment tools.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Pre-training Enables Multimodal AI Differentiation of Radiation Necrosis from Brain Metastasis Progression on Routine MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Differentiating radiation necrosis (RN) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains a critical challenge in brain metastases. While histopathology represents the gold standard, its invasiveness limits feasibility. Conventional supervised deep learning approaches are constrained by scarce biopsy-confirmed training data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) overcomes this by leveraging the growing availability of large-scale unlabeled brain metastases imaging datasets. Methods: In a two-phase deep learning strategy inspired by the foundation model paradigm, a Vision Transformer (ViT) was pre-trained via SSL on 10,167 unlabeled multi-source T1CE MRI sub-volumes. The pre-trained ViT was then fine-tuned for RN classification using a two-channel input (T1CE MRI and segmentation masks) on the public MOLAB dataset (n=109) using 20% of datasets as same-center held-out test set. External validation was performed on a second-center test cohort (n=28). Results: The self-supervised model achieved an AUC of 0.916 on the same-center test set and 0.764 on the second center test set, surpassing the fully supervised ViT (AUC 0.624/0.496; p=0.001/0.008) and radiomics (AUC 0.807/0.691; p=0.005/0.014). Multimodal integration further improved performance (AUC 0.947/0.821; p=0.073/0.001). Attention map visualizations enabled interpretability showing the model focused on clinically relevant lesion subregions. Conclusion: Large-scale pre-training on increasingly available unlabeled brain metastases datasets substantially improves AI model performance. A two-phase multimodal deep learning strategy achieved high accuracy in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression using only routine T1CE MRI and standard clinical data, providing an interpretable, clinically accessible solution that warrants further validation.</description>

      <title>Using MLIR Transform to Design Sliced Convolution Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes SConvTransform, a Transform dialect extension that provides operations for optimizing 2D convolutions in MLIR. Its main operation, SConvOp, lowers Linalg convolutions into tiled and packed generic operations through a fully declarative transformation pipeline. The process is guided by a Convolution Slicing Analysis that determines tile sizes and data layout strategies based on input and filter shapes, as well as target architecture parameters. SConvOp handles edge cases by splitting irregular regions and adjusting affine maps where needed. All packing and tiling operations are derived from a parametric set of affine equations, enabling reusable and analyzable transformations. Although functional correctness was the primary goal of this work, the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SConvTransform, achieving good enough performance across different target architectures. Future work will focus on optimizing performance and porting to other target devices. When applied to standard convolution configurations, the generated code achieves up to 60% of peak performance on ARM SME and 67% on Intel AVX512. These results validate the benefit of combining static shape analysis with structured tiling and packing strategies within the MLIR Transform dialect. Furthermore, the modular design of SConvTransform facilitates integration with future extensions, enabling continued optimization of convolution workloads through MLIR's extensible compilation infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Parallel qMRI Reconstruction from 4x Accelerated Acquisitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisitions require extensive scan times, limiting patient throughput and increasing susceptibility to motion artifacts. Accelerated parallel MRI techniques reduce acquisition time by undersampling k-space data, but require robust reconstruction methods to recover high-quality images. Traditional approaches like SENSE require both undersampled k-space data and pre-computed coil sensitivity maps. We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly estimates coil sensitivity maps and reconstructs images from only undersampled k-space measurements at 4x acceleration. Our two-module architecture consists of a Coil Sensitivity Map (CSM) estimation module and a U-Net-based MRI reconstruction module. We evaluate our method on multi-coil brain MRI data from 10 subjects with 8 echoes each, using 2x SENSE reconstructions as ground truth. Our approach produces visually smoother reconstructions compared to conventional SENSE output, achieving comparable visual quality despite lower PSNR/SSIM metrics. We identify key challenges including spatial misalignment between different acceleration factors and propose future directions for improved reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>EgoVITA: Learning to Plan and Verify for Egocentric Video Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning about intentions and actions from a first-person (egocentric) perspective remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike third-person (exocentric) videos that capture scenes from an outside observer, egocentric videos reflect the actor's continuously changing viewpoint, introducing partial observability, limited field of view, and self-referenced motion. We introduce $\textbf{EgoVITA}$, a reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to reason through structured planning and verification. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EgoVITA alternates between two stages: (1) an $\textbf{egocentric planning phase}$, where the model reasons from a first-person viewpoint to predict a step-by-step plan of future actions, and (2) an $\textbf{exocentric verification phase}$, where it switches to a third-person perspective to check the visual and logical consistency of that plan. Through GRPO, the model learns to make plans that are causally predictive of upcoming visual observations, leading to more coherent and visually grounded reasoning. EgoVITA achieves significant gains on egocentric reasoning tasks, outperforming the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by $\mathbf{+7.7}$ on EgoBlind and $\mathbf{+4.4}$ on EgoOrient, while maintaining strong generalization on exocentric video tasks.</description>

      <title>UniFlow: Towards Zero-Shot LiDAR Scene Flow for Autonomous Vehicles via Cross-Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR scene flow is the task of estimating per-point 3D motion between consecutive point clouds. Recent methods achieve centimeter-level accuracy on popular autonomous vehicle (AV) datasets, but are typically only trained and evaluated on a single sensor. In this paper, we aim to learn general motion priors that transfer to diverse and unseen LiDAR sensors. However, prior work in LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection demonstrate that naively training on multiple datasets yields worse performance than single dataset models. Interestingly, we find that this conventional wisdom does not hold for motion estimation, and that state-of-the-art scene flow methods greatly benefit from cross-dataset training. We posit that low-level tasks such as motion estimation may be less sensitive to sensor configuration; indeed, our analysis shows that models trained on fast-moving objects (e.g., from highway datasets) perform well on fast-moving objects, even across different datasets. Informed by our analysis, we propose UniFlow, a family of feedforward models that unifies and trains on multiple large-scale LiDAR scene flow datasets with diverse sensor placements and point cloud densities. Our frustratingly simple solution establishes a new state-of-the-art on Waymo and nuScenes, improving over prior work by 5.1% and 35.2% respectively. Moreover, UniFlow achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on unseen datasets like TruckScenes, outperforming prior TruckScenes-specific models by 30.1%.</description>

      <title>Sequence-Adaptive Video Prediction in Continuous Streams using Diffusion Noise Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate diffusion-based video prediction models, which forecast future video frames, for continuous video streams. In this context, the models observe continuously new training samples, and we aim to leverage this to improve their predictions. We thus propose an approach that continuously adapts a pre-trained diffusion model to a video stream. Since fine-tuning the parameters of a large diffusion model is too expensive, we refine the diffusion noise during inference while keeping the model parameters frozen, allowing the model to adaptively determine suitable sampling noise. We term the approach Sequence Adaptive Video Prediction with Diffusion Noise Optimization (SAVi-DNO). To validate our approach, we introduce a new evaluation setting on the Ego4D dataset, focusing on simultaneous adaptation and evaluation on long continuous videos. Empirical results demonstrate improved performance based on FVD, SSIM, and PSNR metrics on long videos of Ego4D and OpenDV-YouTube, as well as videos of UCF-101 and SkyTimelapse, showcasing SAVi-DNO's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>MammothModa2: A Unified AR-Diffusion Framework for Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to integrate understanding and generation within a single framework, yet bridging the gap between discrete semantic reasoning and high-fidelity visual synthesis remains challenging. We present MammothModa2 (Mammoth2), a unified autoregressive-diffusion (AR-Diffusion) framework designed to effectively couple autoregressive semantic planning with diffusion-based generation. Mammoth2 adopts a serial design: an AR path equipped with generation experts performs global semantic modeling over discrete tokens, while a single-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder handles high-fidelity image synthesis. A carefully designed AR-Diffusion feature alignment module combines multi-layer feature aggregation, unified condition encoding, and in-context conditioning to stably align AR's representations with the diffusion decoder's continuous latents. Mammoth2 is trained end-to-end with joint Next-Token Prediction and Flow Matching objectives, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning over both generation and editing. With roughly 60M supervised generation samples and no reliance on pre-trained generators, Mammoth2 delivers strong text-to-image and instruction-based editing performance on public benchmarks, achieving 0.87 on GenEval, 87.2 on DPGBench, and 4.06 on ImgEdit, while remaining competitive with understanding-only backbones (e.g., Qwen3-VL-8B) on multimodal understanding tasks. These results suggest that a carefully coupled AR-Diffusion architecture can provide high-fidelity generation and editing while maintaining strong multimodal comprehension within a single, parameter- and data-efficient model.</description>

      <title>SatSAM2: Motion-Constrained Video Object Tracking in Satellite Imagery using Promptable SAM2 and Kalman Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing satellite video tracking methods often struggle with generalization, requiring scenario-specific training to achieve satisfactory performance, and are prone to track loss in the presence of occlusion. To address these challenges, we propose SatSAM2, a zero-shot satellite video tracker built on SAM2, designed to adapt foundation models to the remote sensing domain. SatSAM2 introduces two core modules: a Kalman Filter-based Constrained Motion Module (KFCMM) to exploit temporal motion cues and suppress drift, and a Motion-Constrained State Machine (MCSM) to regulate tracking states based on motion dynamics and reliability. To support large-scale evaluation, we propose MatrixCity Video Object Tracking (MVOT), a synthetic benchmark containing 1,500+ sequences and 157K annotated frames with diverse viewpoints, illumination, and occlusion conditions. Extensive experiments on two satellite tracking benchmarks and MVOT show that SatSAM2 outperforms both traditional and foundation model-based trackers, including SAM2 and its variants. Notably, on the OOTB dataset, SatSAM2 achieves a 5.84% AUC improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset will be publicly released to encourage further research.</description>

      <title>Beyond Words and Pixels: A Benchmark for Implicit World Knowledge Reasoning in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models today are capable of producing photorealistic, instruction-following images, yet they still frequently fail on prompts that require implicit world knowledge. Existing evaluation protocols either emphasize compositional alignment or rely on single-round VQA-based scoring, leaving critical dimensions such as knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence-substantially undertested. To address these limitations, we introduce PicWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark that assesses the grasp of implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning of T2I models. This benchmark consists of 1,100 prompts across three core categories. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we propose PW-Agent, an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator to hierarchically assess images on their physical realism and logical consistency by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence. We conduct a thorough analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models on PicWorld, illustrating that they universally exhibit a fundamental limitation in their capacity for implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning to varying degrees. The findings highlight the need for reasoning-aware, knowledge-integrative architectures in future T2I systems.</description>

      <title>Vision Token Masking Alone Cannot Prevent PHI Leakage in Medical Document OCR: A Systematic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed for optical character recognition (OCR) in healthcare settings, raising critical concerns about protected health information (PHI) exposure during document processing. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of inference-time vision token masking as a privacy-preserving mechanism for medical document OCR using DeepSeek-OCR. We introduce seven masking strategies (V3-V9) targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) and evaluate PHI reduction across HIPAA-defined categories using 100 synthetic medical billing statements (drawn from a corpus of 38,517 annotated documents) with perfect ground-truth annotations. All masking strategies converge to 42.9% PHI reduction, successfully suppressing long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, physical addresses at 100% effectiveness) while failing to prevent short structured identifiers (medical record numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, account numbers at 0% effectiveness). Ablation studies varying mask expansion radius (r=1,2,3) demonstrate that increased spatial coverage does not improve reduction beyond this ceiling, indicating that language model contextual inference - not insufficient visual masking - drives structured identifier leakage. A simulated hybrid architecture combining vision masking with NLP post-processing achieves 88.6% total PHI reduction (assuming 80% NLP accuracy on remaining identifiers). This negative result establishes boundaries for vision-only privacy interventions in VLMs, provides guidance distinguishing PHI types amenable to vision-level versus language-level redaction, and redirects future research toward decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA-compliant medical document processing.</description>

      <title>Point-to-Point: Sparse Motion Guidance for Controllable Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately preserving motion while editing a subject remains a core challenge in video editing tasks. Existing methods often face a trade-off between edit and motion fidelity, as they rely on motion representations that are either overfitted to the layout or only implicitly defined. To overcome this limitation, we revisit point-based motion representation. However, identifying meaningful points remains challenging without human input, especially across diverse video scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel motion representation, anchor tokens, that capture the most essential motion patterns by leveraging the rich prior of a video diffusion model. Anchor tokens encode video dynamics compactly through a small number of informative point trajectories and can be flexibly relocated to align with new subjects. This allows our method, Point-to-Point, to generalize across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that anchor tokens lead to more controllable and semantically aligned video edits, achieving superior performance in terms of edit and motion fidelity.</description>

      <title>Uni-DAD: Unified Distillation and Adaptation of Diffusion Models for Few-step Few-shot Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) produce high-quality images, yet their sampling remains costly when adapted to new domains. Distilled DMs are faster but typically remain confined within their teacher's domain. Thus, fast and high-quality generation for novel domains relies on two-stage training pipelines: Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt. However, both add design complexity and suffer from degraded quality or diversity. We introduce Uni-DAD, a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of DMs. It couples two signals during training: (i) a dual-domain distribution-matching distillation objective that guides the student toward the distributions of the source teacher and a target teacher, and (ii) a multi-head generative adversarial network (GAN) loss that encourages target realism across multiple feature scales. The source domain distillation preserves diverse source knowledge, while the multi-head GAN stabilizes training and reduces overfitting, especially in few-shot regimes. The inclusion of a target teacher facilitates adaptation to more structurally distant domains. We perform evaluations on a variety of datasets for few-shot image generation (FSIG) and subject-driven personalization (SDP). Uni-DAD delivers higher quality than state-of-the-art (SoTA) adaptation methods even with less than 4 sampling steps, and outperforms two-stage training pipelines in both quality and diversity.</description>

      <title>RoadSceneVQA: Benchmarking Visual Question Answering in Roadside Perception Systems for Intelligent Transportation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current roadside perception systems mainly focus on instance-level perception, which fall short in enabling interaction via natural language and reasoning about traffic behaviors in context. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoadSceneVQA, a large-scale and richly annotated visual question answering (VQA) dataset specifically tailored for roadside scenarios. The dataset comprises 34,736 diverse QA pairs collected under varying weather, illumination, and traffic conditions, targeting not only object attributes but also the intent, legality, and interaction patterns of traffic participants. RoadSceneVQA challenges models to perform both explicit recognition and implicit commonsense reasoning, grounded in real-world traffic rules and contextual dependencies. To fully exploit the reasoning potential of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we further propose CogniAnchor Fusion (CAF), a vision-language fusion module inspired by human-like scene anchoring mechanisms. Moreover, we propose the Assisted Decoupled Chain-of-Thought (AD-CoT) to enhance the reasoned thinking via CoT prompting and multi-task learning. Based on the above, we propose the baseline model RoadMind. Experiments on RoadSceneVQA and CODA-LM benchmark show that the pipeline consistently improves both reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing the MLLM to achieve state-of-the-art performance in structural traffic perception and reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>SwiftVGGT: A Scalable Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer for Large-Scale Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction in large-scale scenes is a fundamental task in 3D perception, but the inherent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. Existing methods either prioritize speed and produce low-quality results, or achieve high-quality reconstruction at the cost of slow inference times. In this paper, we propose SwiftVGGT, a training-free method that significantly reduce inference time while preserving high-quality dense 3D reconstruction. To maintain global consistency in large-scale scenes, SwiftVGGT performs loop closure without relying on the external Visual Place Recognition (VPR) model. This removes redundant computation and enables accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective point sampling method to align neighboring chunks using a single Sim(3)-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step. This eliminates the need for the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization commonly used in prior work, leading to substantial speed-ups. We evaluate SwiftVGGT on multiple datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while requiring only 33% of the inference time of recent VGGT-based large-scale reconstruction approaches.</description>

      <title>DiVE-k: Differential Visual Reasoning for Fine-grained Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) possess extensive text knowledge but struggles to utilize this knowledge for fine-grained image recognition, often failing to differentiate between visually similar categories. Existing fine-tuning methods using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with exact-match reward signals are often brittle, encourage memorization of training categories, and fail to elicit differential reasoning needed for generalization to unseen classes. To address this, we propose $\textbf{DiVE-k}$, $\textbf{Di}$fferential $\textbf{V}$isual r$\textbf{E}$asoning using top-$\textbf{k}$ generations, framework that leverages model's own top-k predictions as a training signal. For each training image, DiVE-k creates a multiple-choice question from the model's top-k outputs and uses RL to train the model to select the correct answer. This approach requires the model to perform fine-grained differential reasoning among plausible options and provides a simple, verifiable reward signal that mitigates memorization and improves generalization. Experiments on five standard fine-grained datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. In the standard base-to-novel generalization setting, DiVE-k surpasses the QWEN2.5-VL-7B and ViRFT by 10.04% and 6.16% on the Harmonic Mean metric, respectively. Further experiments show similar gains in mixed-domain and few-shot scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Styled handwriting generation aims to synthesize handwritten text that looks both realistic and aligned with a specific writer's style. While recent approaches involving GAN, transformer and diffusion-based models have made progress, they often struggle to capture the full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns that span long-range spatial dependencies. As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer. Together, these components lead to handwriting synthesis that is not only more stylistically coherent, but also easier to understand and analyze.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stroke majorly causes death and disability worldwide, and early recognition is one of the key elements of successful treatment of the same. It is common to diagnose strokes using CT scanning, which is fast and readily available, however, manual analysis may take time and may result in mistakes. In this work, a pre-trained Vision Transformer-based transfer learning framework is proposed for the early identification of brain stroke. A few of the encoder blocks of the ViT model are frozen, and the rest are allowed to be fine-tuned in order to learn brain stroke-specific features. The features that have been extracted are given as input to a single-layer Bi-GRU to perform classification. Class imbalance is handled by data augmentation. The model has achieved 94.06% accuracy in classifying brain stroke from the Stroke Dataset.</description>

      <title>Optimal Pose Guidance for Stereo Calibration in 3D Deformation Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereo optical measurement techniques, such as digital image correlation (DIC), are widely used in 3D deformation measurement as non-contact, full-field measurement methods, in which stereo calibration is a crucial step. However, current stereo calibration methods lack intuitive optimal pose guidance, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal accuracy in deformation measurements. The aim of this study is to develop an interactive calibration framework that automatically generates the next optimal pose, enabling high-accuracy stereo calibration for 3D deformation measurement. We propose a pose optimization method that introduces joint optimization of relative and absolute extrinsic parameters, with the minimization of the covariance matrix trace adopted as the loss function to solve for the next optimal pose. Integrated with this method is a user-friendly graphical interface, which guides even non-expert users to capture qualified calibration images. Our proposed method demonstrates superior efficiency (requiring fewer images) and accuracy (demonstrating lower measurement errors) compared to random pose, while maintaining robustness across varying FOVs. In the thermal deformation measurement tests on an S-shaped specimen, the results exhibit high agreement with finite element analysis (FEA) simulations in both deformation magnitude and evolutionary trends. We present a pose guidance method for high-precision stereo calibration in 3D deformation measurement. The simulation experiments, real-world experiments, and thermal deformation measurement applications all demonstrate the significant application potential of our proposed method in the field of 3D deformation measurement.

      <title>General vs Domain-Specific CNNs: Understanding Pretraining Effects on Brain MRI Tumor Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumor detection from MRI scans plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly when pretrained on large datasets. However, it remains unclear which type of pretrained model performs better when only a small dataset is available: those trained on domain-specific medical data or those pretrained on large general datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluate three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor classification: RadImageNet DenseNet121 with medical-domain pretraining, EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, which are modern general-purpose CNNs. All models were trained and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a limited-size brain MRI dataset to ensure a fair comparison. Our results reveal that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest accuracy, followed by EfficientNetV2S, while RadImageNet DenseNet121, despite being pretrained on domain-specific medical data, exhibited poor generalization with lower accuracy and higher loss. These findings suggest that domain-specific pretraining may not generalize well under small-data conditions. In contrast, modern, deeper general-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets can offer superior transfer learning performance in specialized medical imaging tasks.</description>

      <title>SciPostLayoutTree: A Dataset for Structural Analysis of Scientific Posters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific posters play a vital role in academic communication by presenting ideas through visual summaries. Analyzing reading order and parent-child relations of posters is essential for building structure-aware interfaces that facilitate clear and accurate understanding of research content. Despite their prevalence in academic communication, posters remain underexplored in structural analysis research, which has primarily focused on papers. To address this gap, we constructed SciPostLayoutTree, a dataset of approximately 8,000 posters annotated with reading order and parent-child relations. Compared to an existing structural analysis dataset, SciPostLayoutTree contains more instances of spatially challenging relations, including upward, horizontal, and long-distance relations. As a solution to these challenges, we develop Layout Tree Decoder, which incorporates visual features as well as bounding box features including position and category information. The model also uses beam search to predict relations while capturing sequence-level plausibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our model improves the prediction accuracy for spatially challenging relations and establishes a solid baseline for poster structure analysis. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/omron-sinicx/scipostlayouttree. The code is also publicly available at https://github.com/omron-sinicx/scipostlayouttree.</description>

      <title>ConsistCompose: Unified Multimodal Layout Control for Image Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified multimodal models that couple visual understanding with image generation have advanced rapidly, yet most systems still focus on visual grounding-aligning language with image regions-while their generative counterpart, linguistic-embedded layout-grounded generation (LELG) for layout-controllable multi-instance generation, remains underexplored and limits precise compositional control. We present ConsistCompose, a unified multimodal framework that embeds layout coordinates directly into language prompts, enabling layout-controlled multi-instance image generation from Interleaved Image-Text within a single generative interface. We further construct ConsistCompose3M, a 3.4M multi-instance generation dataset with layout and identity annotations (2.6M text-guided and 0.8M image-guided data pairs) that provides large-scale supervision for layout-conditioned generation. Within this framework, LELG is instantiated through instance-coordinate binding prompts and coordinate-aware classifier-free guidance, which translate linguistic layout cues into precise spatial control without task-specific branches. Experiments on COCO-Position and MS-Bench show that ConsistCompose substantially improves spatial accuracy over layout-controlled baselines while preserving identity fidelity and competitive general multimodal understanding, establishing a unified paradigm for layout-controllable multimodal image generation.</description>

      <title>A Tri-Modal Dataset and a Baseline System for Tracking Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of low altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), visual multi-object tracking is becoming a critical security technology, demanding significant robustness even in complex environmental conditions. However, tracking UAVs using a single visual modality often fails in challenging scenarios, such as low illumination, cluttered backgrounds, and rapid motion. Although multi-modal multi-object UAV tracking is more resilient, the development of effective solutions has been hindered by the absence of dedicated public datasets. To bridge this gap, we release MM-UAV, the first large-scale benchmark for Multi-Modal UAV Tracking, integrating three key sensing modalities, e.g. RGB, infrared (IR), and event signals. The dataset spans over 30 challenging scenarios, with 1,321 synchronised multi-modal sequences, and more than 2.8 million annotated frames. Accompanying the dataset, we provide a novel multi-modal multi-UAV tracking framework, designed specifically for UAV tracking applications and serving as a baseline for future research. Our framework incorporates two key technical innovations, e.g. an offset-guided adaptive alignment module to resolve spatio mismatches across sensors, and an adaptive dynamic fusion module to balance complementary information conveyed by different modalities. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of conventional appearance modelling in multi-object tracking, we introduce an event-enhanced association mechanism that leverages motion cues from the event modality for more reliable identity maintenance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. To foster further research in multi-modal UAV tracking, both the dataset and source code will be made publicly available at https://xuefeng-zhu5.github.io/MM-UAV/.</description>

      <title>FlowPortal: Residual-Corrected Flow for Training-Free Video Relighting and Background Replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video relighting with background replacement is a challenging task critical for applications in film production and creative media. Existing methods struggle to balance temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and illumination naturalness. To address these issues, we introduce FlowPortal, a novel training-free flow-based video relighting framework. Our core innovation is a Residual-Corrected Flow mechanism that transforms a standard flow-based model into an editing model, guaranteeing perfect reconstruction when input conditions are identical and enabling faithful relighting when they differ, resulting in high structural consistency. This is further enhanced by a Decoupled Condition Design for precise lighting control and a High-Frequency Transfer mechanism for detail preservation. Additionally, a masking strategy isolates foreground relighting from background pure generation process. Experiments demonstrate that FlowPortal achieves superior performance in temporal coherence, structural preservation, and lighting realism, while maintaining high efficiency.

      <title>MagicWand: A Universal Agent for Generation and Evaluation Aligned with User Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) models have enabled significant progress in image and video generation. However, users still struggle to obtain content that aligns with their preferences due to the difficulty of crafting detailed prompts and the lack of mechanisms to retain their preferences. To address these challenges, we construct \textbf{UniPrefer-100K}, a large-scale dataset comprising images, videos, and associated text that describes the styles users tend to prefer. Based on UniPrefer-100K, we propose \textbf{MagicWand}, a universal generation and evaluation agent that enhances prompts based on user preferences, leverages advanced generation models for high-quality content, and applies preference-aligned evaluation and refinement. In addition, we introduce \textbf{UniPreferBench}, the first large-scale benchmark with over 120K annotations for assessing user preference alignment across diverse AIGC tasks. Experiments on UniPreferBench demonstrate that MagicWand consistently generates content and evaluations that are well aligned with user preferences across a wide range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>TRANSPORTER: Transferring Visual Semantics from VLM Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do video understanding models acquire their answers? Although current Vision Language Models (VLMs) reason over complex scenes with diverse objects, action performances, and scene dynamics, understanding and controlling their internal processes remains an open challenge. Motivated by recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generative models, this paper introduces a logits-to-video (L2V) task alongside a model-independent approach, TRANSPORTER, to generate videos that capture the underlying rules behind VLMs' predictions. Given the high-visual-fidelity produced by T2V models, TRANSPORTER learns an optimal transport coupling to VLM's high-semantic embedding spaces. In turn, logit scores define embedding directions for conditional video generation. TRANSPORTER generates videos that reflect caption changes over diverse object attributes, action adverbs, and scene context. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across VLMs demonstrate that L2V can provide a fidelity-rich, novel direction for model interpretability that has not been previously explored.</description>

      <title>Alias-free 4D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based on Gaussian Splatting enable real-time rendering and generate realistic images. However, adjusting the camera's focal length or the distance between Gaussian primitives and the camera to modify rendering resolution often introduces strong artifacts, stemming from the frequency constraints of 4D Gaussians and Gaussian scale mismatch induced by the 2D dilated filter. To address this, we derive a maximum sampling frequency formulation for 4D Gaussian Splatting and introduce a 4D scale-adaptive filter and scale loss, which flexibly regulates the sampling frequency of 4D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach eliminates high-frequency artifacts under increased rendering frequencies while effectively reducing redundant Gaussians in multi-view video reconstruction. We validate the proposed method through monocular and multi-view video reconstruction experiments.Ours project page: https://4d-alias-free.github.io/4D-Alias-free/</description>

      <title>MimiCAT: Mimic with Correspondence-Aware Cascade-Transformer for Category-Free 3D Pose Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D pose transfer aims to transfer the pose-style of a source mesh to a target character while preserving both the target's geometry and the source's pose characteristic. Existing methods are largely restricted to characters with similar structures and fail to generalize to category-free settings (e.g., transferring a humanoid's pose to a quadruped). The key challenge lies in the structural and transformation diversity inherent in distinct character types, which often leads to mismatched regions and poor transfer quality. To address these issues, we first construct a million-scale pose dataset across hundreds of distinct characters. We further propose MimiCAT, a cascade-transformer model designed for category-free 3D pose transfer. Instead of relying on strict one-to-one correspondence mappings, MimiCAT leverages semantic keypoint labels to learn a novel soft correspondence that enables flexible many-to-many matching across characters. The pose transfer is then formulated as a conditional generation process, in which the source transformations are first projected onto the target through soft correspondence matching and subsequently refined using shape-conditioned representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MimiCAT transfers plausible poses across different characters, significantly outperforming prior methods that are limited to narrow category transfer (e.g., humanoid-to-humanoid).</description>

      <title>MASS: Motion-Aware Spatial-Temporal Grounding for Physics Reasoning and Comprehension in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on standard video tasks but struggle with physics-driven reasoning involving motion dynamics and spatial interactions. This limitation reduces their ability to interpret real or AI-generated content (AIGC) videos and to generate physically consistent content. We present an approach that addresses this gap by translating physical-world context cues into interpretable representations aligned with VLMs' perception, comprehension, and reasoning. We introduce MASS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 4,350 real-world and AIGC videos and 8,361 free-form video question-answering pairs focused on physics-related comprehension tasks, with detailed annotations including visual detections, sub-segment grounding, and full-sequence 3D motion tracking of entities. We further present MASS, a model-agnostic method that injects spatial-temporal signals into the VLM language space via depth-based 3D encoding and visual grounding, coupled with a motion tracker for object dynamics. To strengthen cross-modal alignment and reasoning, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning. Experiments and ablations show that our refined VLMs outperform comparable and larger baselines, as well as prior state-of-the-art models, by 8.7% and 6.0%, achieving performance comparable to close-source SoTA VLMs such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on physics reasoning and comprehension. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Curriculum Reinforces Compositional Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has long been an open problem, with compositional synthesis remaining particularly challenging. This task requires accurate rendering of complex scenes containing multiple objects that exhibit diverse attributes as well as intricate spatial and semantic relationships, demanding both precise object placement and coherent inter-object interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel compositional curriculum reinforcement learning framework named CompGen that addresses compositional weakness in existing T2I models. Specifically, we leverage scene graphs to establish a novel difficulty criterion for compositional ability and develop a corresponding adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo graph sampling algorithm. This difficulty-aware approach enables the synthesis of training curriculum data that progressively optimize T2I models through reinforcement learning. We integrate our curriculum learning approach into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and investigate different curriculum scheduling strategies. Our experiments reveal that CompGen exhibits distinct scaling curves under different curriculum scheduling strategies, with easy-to-hard and Gaussian sampling strategies yielding superior scaling performance compared to random sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompGen significantly enhances compositional generation capabilities for both diffusion-based and auto-regressive T2I models, highlighting its effectiveness in improving the compositional T2I generation systems.</description>

      <title>RNN as Linear Transformer: A Closer Investigation into Representational Potentials of Visual Mamba Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mamba has recently garnered attention as an effective backbone for vision tasks. However, its underlying mechanism in visual domains remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate Mamba's representational properties and make three primary contributions. First, we theoretically analyze Mamba's relationship to Softmax and Linear Attention, confirming that it can be viewed as a low-rank approximation of Softmax Attention and thereby bridging the representational gap between Softmax and Linear forms. Second, we introduce a novel binary segmentation metric for activation map evaluation, extending qualitative assessments to a quantitative measure that demonstrates Mamba's capacity to model long-range dependencies. Third, by leveraging DINO for self-supervised pretraining, we obtain clearer activation maps than those produced by standard supervised approaches, highlighting Mamba's potential for interpretability. Notably, our model also achieves a 78.5 percent linear probing accuracy on ImageNet, underscoring its strong performance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights for future investigations of Mamba-based vision architectures.</description>

      <title>ViMix-14M: A Curated Multi-Source Video-Text Dataset with Long-Form, High-Quality Captions and Crawl-Free Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video generation has surged in interest since Sora, yet open-source models still face a data bottleneck: there is no large, high-quality, easily obtainable video-text corpus. Existing public datasets typically require manual YouTube crawling, which yields low usable volume due to link rot and access limits, and raises licensing uncertainty. This work addresses this challenge by introducing ViMix-14M, a curated multi-source video-text dataset of around 14 million pairs that provides crawl-free, download-ready access and long-form, high-quality captions tightly aligned to video. ViMix-14M is built by merging diverse open video sources, followed by unified de-duplication and quality filtering, and a multi-granularity, ground-truth-guided re-captioning pipeline that refines descriptions to better match actions, scenes, and temporal structure. We evaluate the dataset by multimodal retrieval, text-to-video generation, and video question answering tasks, observing consistent improvements over counterpart datasets. We hope this work can help removing the key barrier to training and fine-tuning open-source video foundation models, and provide insights of building high-quality and generalizable video-text datasets.</description>

      <title>Can a Second-View Image Be a Language? Geometric and Semantic Cross-Modal Reasoning for X-ray Prohibited Item Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic X-ray prohibited items detection is vital for security inspection and has been widely studied. Traditional methods rely on visual modality, often struggling with complex threats. While recent studies incorporate language to guide single-view images, human inspectors typically use dual-view images in practice. This raises the question: can the second view provide constraints similar to a language modality? In this work, we introduce DualXrayBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for X-ray inspection that includes multiple views and modalities. It supports eight tasks designed to test cross-view reasoning. In DualXrayBench, we introduce a caption corpus consisting of 45,613 dual-view image pairs across 12 categories with corresponding captions. Building upon these data, we propose the Geometric (cross-view)-Semantic (cross-modality) Reasoner (GSR), a multimodal model that jointly learns correspondences between cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics, treating the second-view images as a "language-like modality". To enable this, we construct the GSXray dataset, with structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: &lt;top&gt;, &lt;side&gt;, &lt;conclusion&gt;. Comprehensive evaluations on DualXrayBench demonstrate that GSR achieves significant improvements across all X-ray tasks, offering a new perspective for real-world X-ray inspection.</description>

      <title>SegSplat: Feed-forward Gaussian Splatting and Open-Set Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have introduced SegSplat, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between rapid, feed-forward 3D reconstruction and rich, open-vocabulary semantic understanding. By constructing a compact semantic memory bank from multi-view 2D foundation model features and predicting discrete semantic indices alongside geometric and appearance attributes for each 3D Gaussian in a single pass, SegSplat efficiently imbues scenes with queryable semantics. Our experiments demonstrate that SegSplat achieves geometric fidelity comparable to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting methods while simultaneously enabling robust open-set semantic segmentation, crucially \textit{without} requiring any per-scene optimization for semantic feature integration. This work represents a significant step towards practical, on-the-fly generation of semantically aware 3D environments, vital for advancing robotic interaction, augmented reality, and other intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Weak-to-Strong Generalization for CLIP-based Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large-scale commercial models with user intent is crucial to preventing harmful outputs. Current methods rely on human supervision but become impractical as model complexity increases. When models surpass human knowledge, providing accurate feedback becomes challenging and inefficient. A novel solution proposed recently is using a weaker model to supervise a stronger model. This concept leverages the ability of weaker models to perform evaluations, thereby reducing the workload on human supervisors. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language-only models. Extending this concept to vision-language models leverages these insights, adapting the proven benefits to a multi-modal context. In our study, we explore weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification. We propose a method, class prototype learning (CPL), which aims to enhance the classification capabilities of the CLIP model, by learning more representative prototypes for each category. Our findings indicate that, despite using a simple loss function under weak supervision, CPL yields robust improvements in targeted scenarios, particularly when pretraining is limited. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective under these settings, achieving a 3.67% improvement over strong baseline methods.</description>

      <title>ChineseVideoBench: Benchmarking Multi-modal Large Models for Chinese Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ChineseVideoBench, a pioneering benchmark specifically designed for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in Chinese Video Question Answering. The growing demand for sophisticated video analysis capabilities highlights the critical need for comprehensive, culturally-aware evaluation frameworks. ChineseVideoBench addresses this gap by providing a robust dataset and tailored evaluation metrics, enabling rigorous assessment of state-of-the-art MLLMs on complex Chinese video content. Specifically, ChineseVideoBench comprises 8 main classes and 12 sub-classes, encompassing tasks that demand both deep video understanding and nuanced Chinese linguistic and cultural awareness. Our empirical evaluations reveal that ChineseVideoBench presents a significant challenge to current MLLMs. Among the models assessed, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest performance with an overall score of 77.9%, while InternVL-38B emerges as the most competitive open-source model.</description>

      <title>4D-VGGT: A General Foundation Model with SpatioTemporal Awareness for Dynamic Scene Geometry Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a challenging task of dynamic scene geometry estimation, which requires representing both spatial and temporal features. Typically, existing methods align the two features into a unified latent space to model scene geometry. However, this unified paradigm suffers from potential mismatched representation due to the heterogeneous nature between spatial and temporal features. In this work, we propose 4D-VGGT, a general foundation model with divide-and-conquer spatiotemporal representation for dynamic scene geometry. Our model is divided into three aspects: 1) Multi-setting input. We design an adaptive visual grid that supports input sequences with arbitrary numbers of views and time steps. 2) Multi-level representation. We propose a cross-view global fusion for spatial representation and a cross-time local fusion for temporal representation. 3) Multi-task prediction. We append multiple task-specific heads to spatiotemporal representations, enabling a comprehensive visual geometry estimation for dynamic scenes. Under this unified framework, these components enhance the feature discriminability and application universality of our model for dynamic scenes. In addition, we integrate multiple geometry datasets to train our model and conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method across various tasks on multiple dynamic scene geometry benchmarks.</description>

      <title>NeuroVascU-Net: A Unified Multi-Scale and Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion U-Net for Precise 3D Segmentation of Brain Vessels in Contrast-Enhanced T1 MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise 3D segmentation of cerebral vasculature from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1CE) MRI is crucial for safe neurosurgical planning. Manual delineation is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while current automated methods often trade accuracy for computational cost, limiting clinical use. We present NeuroVascU-Net, the first deep learning architecture specifically designed to segment cerebrovascular structures directly from clinically standard T1CE MRI in neuro-oncology patients, addressing a gap in prior work dominated by TOF-MRA-based approaches. NeuroVascU-Net builds on a dilated U-Net and integrates two specialized modules: a Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion ($MSC^2F$) module at the bottleneck and a Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion ($CDA^2F$) module at deeper hierarchical layers. $MSC^2F$ captures both local and global information via multi-scale dilated convolutions, while $CDA^2F$ dynamically integrates domain-specific features, enhancing representation while keeping computation low. The model was trained and validated on a curated dataset of T1CE scans from 137 brain tumor biopsy patients, annotated by a board-certified functional neurosurgeon. NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, accurately segmenting both major and fine vascular structures. Notably, it requires only 12.4M parameters, significantly fewer than transformer-based models such as Swin U-NetR. This balance of accuracy and efficiency positions NeuroVascU-Net as a practical solution for computer-assisted neurosurgical planning.</description>

      <title>CrossJEPA: Cross-Modal Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Efficient 3D Representation Learning from 2D Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-to-point cross-modal learning has emerged to address the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets in 3D representation learning. However, current methods that leverage 2D data often result in large, slow-to-train models, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy in resource-constrained environments. The architecture design of such models is therefore critical, determining their performance, memory footprint, and compute efficiency. The Joint-embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has gained wide popularity in self-supervised learning for its simplicity and efficiency, but has been under-explored in cross-modal settings, partly due to the misconception that masking is intrinsic to JEPA. In this light, we propose CrossJEPA, a simple Cross-modal Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that harnesses the knowledge of an image foundation model and trains a predictor to infer embeddings of specific rendered 2D views from corresponding 3D point clouds, thereby introducing a JEPA-style pretraining strategy beyond masking. By conditioning the predictor on cross-domain projection information, CrossJEPA purifies the supervision signal from semantics exclusive to the target domain. We further exploit the frozen teacher design with a one-time target embedding caching mechanism, yielding amortized efficiency. CrossJEPA achieves a new state-of-the-art in linear probing on the synthetic ModelNet40 (94.2%) and the real-world ScanObjectNN (88.3%) benchmarks, using only 14.1M pretraining parameters (8.5M in the point encoder), and about 6 pretraining hours on a standard single GPU. These results position CrossJEPA as a performant, memory-efficient, and fast-to-train framework for 3D representation learning via knowledge distillation. We analyze CrossJEPA intuitively, theoretically, and empirically, and extensively ablate our design choices. Code will be made available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pneumonia remains a leading global cause of mortality where timely diagnosis is critical. We introduce LungX, a novel hybrid architecture combining EfficientNet's multi-scale features, CBAM attention mechanisms, and Vision Transformer's global context modeling for enhanced pneumonia detection. Evaluated on 20,000 curated chest X-rays from RSNA and CheXpert, LungX achieves state-of-the-art performance (86.5 percent accuracy, 0.943 AUC), representing a 6.7 percent AUC improvement over EfficientNet-B0 baselines. Visual analysis demonstrates superior lesion localization through interpretable attention maps. Future directions include multi-center validation and architectural optimizations targeting 88 percent accuracy for clinical deployment as an AI diagnostic aid.</description>

      <title>DocPTBench: Benchmarking End-to-End Photographed Document Parsing and Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for end-to-end document parsing and translation. However, prevailing benchmarks such as OmniDocBench and DITrans are dominated by pristine scanned or digital-born documents, and thus fail to adequately represent the intricate challenges of real-world capture conditions, such as geometric distortions and photometric variations. To fill this gap, we introduce DocPTBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for Photographed Document Parsing and Translation. DocPTBench comprises over 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents from multiple domains, includes eight translation scenarios, and provides meticulously human-verified annotations for both parsing and translation. Our experiments demonstrate that transitioning from digital-born to photographed documents results in a substantial performance decline: popular MLLMs exhibit an average accuracy drop of 18% in end-to-end parsing and 12% in translation, while specialized document parsing models show significant average decrease of 25%. This substantial performance gap underscores the unique challenges posed by documents captured in real-world conditions and reveals the limited robustness of existing models. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Topdu/DocPTBench.</description>

      <title>When Generative Replay Meets Evolving Deepfakes: Domain-Aware Relative Weighting for Incremental Face Forgery Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of face generation techniques has led to a growing variety of forgery methods. Incremental forgery detection aims to gradually update existing models with new forgery data, yet current sample replay-based methods are limited by low diversity and privacy concerns. Generative replay offers a potential solution by synthesizing past data, but its feasibility for forgery detection remains unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate generative replay and identify two scenarios: when the replay generator closely resembles the new forgery model, generated real samples blur the domain boundary, creating domain-risky samples; when the replay generator differs significantly, generated samples can be safely supervised, forming domain-safe samples. To exploit generative replay effectively, we propose a novel Domain-Aware Relative Weighting (DARW) strategy. DARW directly supervises domain-safe samples while applying a Relative Separation Loss to balance supervision and potential confusion for domain-risky samples. A Domain Confusion Score dynamically adjusts this tradeoff according to sample reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARW consistently improves incremental learning performance for forgery detection under different generative replay settings and alleviates the adverse impact of domain overlap.</description>

      <title>Perceptual-Evidence Anchored Reinforced Learning for Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is now being applied to Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, vanilla RLVR for VLMs verifies only the final textual output, critically neglecting the foundational step of visual perception. This oversight leads to visual hallucinations and reward hacking, as reasoning built upon flawed perception is inherently unreliable. To address this, we propose PEARL (Perceptual-Evidence Anchored Reinforced Learning), a dual-branch, perception-reasoning synergistic that strengthens multimodal reasoning by explicitly anchoring it to verified visual evidence. For each reasoning-oriented QA instance, PEARL first derive a perception checklist -- a set of perception-oriented sub-questions with verifiable answers that probe the model's understanding of key visual evidence. During training, auxiliary rollouts on this checklist yield a perceptual reward that both directly reinforces the model's perception ability and acts as a fidelity gate for reasoning. If the model passes the perception check, its policy update is biased towards evidence-anchored reasoning. Otherwise, the process is halted to prevent reasoning from flawed premises. PEARL can be seamlessly integrated with popular RL methods like GRPO and DAPO. Comprehensive experiments show PEARL achieves substantial gains on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, e.g., a +9.7% improvement over the baseline and +6.6% over GRPO on MathVerse.</description>

      <title>ReCoGS: Real-time ReColoring for Gaussian Splatting scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a leading method for novel view synthesis, offering superior training efficiency and real-time inference compared to NeRF approaches, while still delivering high-quality reconstructions. Beyond view synthesis, this 3D representation has also been explored for editing tasks. Many existing methods leverage 2D diffusion models to generate multi-view datasets for training, but they often suffer from limitations such as view inconsistencies, lack of fine-grained control, and high computational demand. In this work, we focus specifically on the editing task of recoloring. We introduce a user-friendly pipeline that enables precise selection and recoloring of regions within a pre-trained Gaussian Splatting scene. To demonstrate the real-time performance of our method, we also present an interactive tool that allows users to experiment with the pipeline in practice.

      <title>SineProject: Machine Unlearning for Stable Vision Language Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly need to forget specific knowledge such as unsafe or private information without requiring full retraining. However, existing unlearning methods often disrupt vision language alignment, causing models to reject both harmful and benign queries. We trace this failure to the projector network during unlearning, its Jacobian becomes severely illconditioned, leading to unstable optimization and drift in cross modal embeddings. We introduce SineProject, a simple method that augments the frozen projector with sinusoidally modulated trainable parameters, improving the Jacobian's spectral conditioning and stabilizing alignment throughout unlearning. Across standard safety and privacy unlearning benchmarks using LLaVA v1.5 7B and 13B, SineProject reduces benign query refusals while achieving complete forgetting of targeted information, yielding state of the art forget retain trade offs with negligible computational overhead.</description>

      <title>EventBench: Towards Comprehensive Benchmarking of Event-based MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in event-based vision, yet the comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities within a unified benchmark remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EventBench, a benchmark that offers eight diverse task metrics together with a large-scale event stream dataset. EventBench differs from existing event-based benchmarks in four key aspects: (1) openness in accessibility, releasing all raw event streams and task instructions across eight evaluation metrics; (2) diversity in task coverage, spanning understanding, recognition, and spatial reasoning tasks for comprehensive capability assessment; (3) integration in spatial dimensions, pioneering the design of 3D spatial reasoning tasks for event-based MLLMs; and (4) scale in data volume, with an accompanying training set of over one million event-text pairs supporting large-scale training and evaluation. Using EventBench, we evaluate state-of-the-art closed-source models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5 Pro, leading open-source models including Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL3, and event-based MLLMs such as EventGPT that directly process raw event streams. Extensive evaluation reveals that while current event-based MLLMs demonstrate strong performance in event stream understanding, they continue to struggle with fine-grained recognition and spatial reasoning.</description>

      <title>NAF: Zero-Shot Feature Upsampling via Neighborhood Attention Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) extract spatially downsampled representations, posing challenges for pixel-level tasks. Existing upsampling approaches face a fundamental trade-off: classical filters are fast and broadly applicable but rely on fixed forms, while modern upsamplers achieve superior accuracy through learnable, VFM-specific forms at the cost of retraining for each VFM. We introduce Neighborhood Attention Filtering (NAF), which bridges this gap by learning adaptive spatial-and-content weights through Cross-Scale Neighborhood Attention and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), guided solely by the high-resolution input image. NAF operates zero-shot: it upsamples features from any VFM without retraining, making it the first VFM-agnostic architecture to outperform VFM-specific upsamplers and achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks. It maintains high efficiency, scaling to 2K feature maps and reconstructing intermediate-resolution maps at 18 FPS. Beyond feature upsampling, NAF demonstrates strong performance on image restoration, highlighting its versatility. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/valeoai/NAF.</description>

      <title>RegDeepLab: A Two-Stage Decoupled Framework for Interpretable Embryo Fragmentation Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of embryo fragmentation serves as a critical morphological indicator for assessing embryo developmental potential in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinical decision-making. However, current manual grading processes are not only time-consuming but also limited by significant inter-observer variability and efficiency bottlenecks. Although deep learning has demonstrated potential in automated grading in recent years, existing solutions face a significant challenge: pure regression models lack the visual explainability required for clinical practice, while pure segmentation models struggle to directly translate pixel-level masks into precise clinical grades. This study proposes RegDeepLab, a dual-branch Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework that integrates State-of-the-Art (SOTA) semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3+) with a multi-scale regression head. Addressing the common issues of "Gradient Conflict" and "Negative Transfer" in multi-task training, we propose a "Two-Stage Decoupled Training Strategy." Experimental results demonstrate that while standard end-to-end MTL training can minimize grading error (MAE=0.046) through our designed "Feature Injection" mechanism, it compromises the integrity of segmentation boundaries. In contrast, our decoupled strategy successfully provides robust and high-precision grading predictions while preserving SOTA-level segmentation accuracy (Dice=0.729). Furthermore, we introduce a "Range Loss" to effectively utilize large-scale discrete grading data for semi-supervised learning. This study ultimately presents a dual-module clinical auxiliary solution that combines high accuracy with visual explainability.</description>

      <title>Alternating Perception-Reasoning for Hallucination-Resistant Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sufficient visual perception is the foundation of video reasoning. Nevertheless, existing Video Reasoning LLMs suffer from perception shortcuts, relying on a flawed single-step perception paradigm. This paradigm describes the video and then conducts reasoning, which runs the risk of insufficient evidence and emergent hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce a new framework that integrates a loop-based paradigm with an anti-hallucination reward. First, to address the insufficient evidence, we introduce the Perception Loop Reasoning (PLR) paradigm. Instead of describing the video at once, each loop requires the model to describe a video segment with precise timestamps, analyze this segment, and decide the next action. Second, for the risk of hallucinations, the Factual-Aware Evaluator (FAE) evaluates each perception result as a reliable anti-hallucination reward. This reward encourages the model to provide sufficient and precise video evidence.

      <title>Gaze Beyond the Frame: Forecasting Egocentric 3D Visual Span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People continuously perceive and interact with their surroundings based on underlying intentions that drive their exploration and behaviors. While research in egocentric user and scene understanding has focused primarily on motion and contact-based interaction, forecasting human visual perception itself remains less explored despite its fundamental role in guiding human actions and its implications for AR/VR and assistive technologies. We address the challenge of egocentric 3D visual span forecasting, predicting where a person's visual perception will focus next within their three-dimensional environment. To this end, we propose EgoSpanLift, a novel method that transforms egocentric visual span forecasting from 2D image planes to 3D scenes. EgoSpanLift converts SLAM-derived keypoints into gaze-compatible geometry and extracts volumetric visual span regions. We further combine EgoSpanLift with 3D U-Net and unidirectional transformers, enabling spatio-temporal fusion to efficiently predict future visual span in the 3D grid. In addition, we curate a comprehensive benchmark from raw egocentric multisensory data, creating a testbed with 364.6K samples for 3D visual span forecasting. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines for egocentric 2D gaze anticipation and 3D localization while achieving comparable results even when projected back onto 2D image planes without additional 2D-specific training.</description>

      <title>Robust Posterior Diffusion-based Sampling via Adaptive Guidance Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art results across various imaging tasks. A central challenge in this setting lies in balancing the contribution of the prior with the data fidelity term: overly aggressive likelihood updates may introduce artifacts, while conservative updates can slow convergence or yield suboptimal reconstructions. In this work, we propose an adaptive likelihood step-size strategy to guide the diffusion process for inverse-problem formulations. Specifically, we develop an observation-dependent weighting scheme based on the agreement between two different approximations of the intractable intermediate likelihood gradients, that adapts naturally to the diffusion schedule, time re-spacing, and injected stochasticity. The resulting approach, Adaptive Posterior diffusion Sampling (AdaPS), is hyperparameter-free and improves reconstruction quality across diverse imaging tasks - including super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring - on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet-256 validation sets. AdaPS consistently surpasses existing diffusion-based baselines in perceptual quality with minimal or no loss in distortion, without any task-specific tuning. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness to the number of diffusion steps, observation noise levels, and varying stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in HSI Reconstruction using Physics-Aware Diffusion Priors and Optics-Encoded Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image reconstruction from a compressed measurement is a highly ill-posed inverse problem. Current data-driven methods suffer from hallucination due to the lack of spectral diversity in existing hyperspectral image datasets, particularly when they are evaluated for the metamerism phenomenon. In this work, we formulate hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction as a Bayesian inference problem and propose a framework, HSDiff, that utilizes an unconditionally trained, pixel-level diffusion prior and posterior diffusion sampling to generate diverse HSI samples consistent with the measurements of various hyperspectral image formation models. We propose an enhanced metameric augmentation technique using region-based metameric black and partition-of-union spectral upsampling to expand training with physically valid metameric spectra, strengthening the prior diversity and improving uncertainty calibration. We utilize HSDiff to investigate how the studied forward models shape the posterior distribution and demonstrate that guiding with effective spectral encoding provides calibrated informative uncertainty compared to non-encoded models. Through the lens of the Bayesian framework, HSDiff offers a complete, high-performance method for uncertainty-aware HSI reconstruction. Our results also reiterate the significance of effective spectral encoding in snapshot hyperspectral imaging.</description>

      <title>Extreme Model Compression for Edge Vision-Language Models: Sparse Temporal Token Fusion and Adaptive Neural Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for edge AI in vision-language tasks requires models that achieve real-time performance on resource-constrained devices with limited power and memory. This paper proposes two adaptive compression techniques -- Sparse Temporal Token Fusion (STTF) and Adaptive Neural Compression (ANC) -- that integrate algorithmic innovations with hardware-aware optimizations. Unlike previous approaches relying on static pruning or uniform scaling, STTF dynamically reuses visual tokens through event-driven change detection, while ANC conditionally activates encoder branches via a learned router, enabling fine-grained adaptation to scene complexity. Our 3B-parameter TinyGPT-STTF achieves CIDEr 131.2, BLEU-4 0.38, METEOR 0.31, and ROUGE-L 0.56 on the COCO 2017 test set, surpassing LLaVA-1.5 7B by 17.6 CIDEr points while using 2.3x fewer parameters and 62x fewer on-device FLOPs. TinyGPT-ANC reaches CIDEr 128.5. On event-based vision tasks, STTF reduces average token count by 84% (from 196 to 31 tokens) while preserving 95.6% accuracy on the DVS128 Gesture dataset, and ANC cuts FLOPs by up to 90% in low-motion scenes. Compared to strong baselines, our models improve accuracy by up to 4.4% and reduce latency by up to 13x. These results enable efficient deployment of capable vision-language models on real-world edge devices.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Continual Learning with MLLMs from Multi-scenario Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning in visual understanding aims to deal with catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios. Specifically, it decouples the visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. A consistency constraint is imposed on the features of each branch to maintain the stability of visual representations across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset demonstrate that UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.</description>

      <title>LRDUN: A Low-Rank Deep Unfolding Network for Efficient Spectral Compressive Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have achieved remarkable success and become the mainstream paradigm for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) reconstruction. Existing DUNs are derived from full-HSI imaging models, where each stage operates directly on the high-dimensional HSI, refining the entire data cube based on the single 2D coded measurement. However, this paradigm leads to computational redundancy and suffers from the ill-posed nature of mapping 2D residuals back to 3D space of HSI. In this paper, we propose two novel imaging models corresponding to the spectral basis and subspace image by explicitly integrating low-rank (LR) decomposition with the sensing model. Compared to recovering the full HSI, estimating these compact low-dimensional components significantly mitigates the ill-posedness. Building upon these novel models, we develop the Low-Rank Deep Unfolding Network (LRDUN), which jointly solves the two subproblems within an unfolded proximal gradient descent (PGD) framework. Furthermore, we introduce a Generalized Feature Unfolding Mechanism (GFUM) that decouples the physical rank in the data-fidelity term from the feature dimensionality in the prior module, enhancing the representational capacity and flexibility of the network. Extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed LRDUN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality with significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Unified Deep Learning Platform for Dust and Fault Diagnosis in Solar Panels Using Thermal and Visual Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most abundant and tapped sources of renewable energies with enormous future potential. Solar panel output can vary widely with factors like intensity, temperature, dirt, debris and so on affecting it. We have implemented a model on detecting dust and fault on solar panels. These two applications are centralized as a single-platform and can be utilized for routine-maintenance and any other checks. These are checked against various parameters such as power output, sinusoidal wave (I-V component of solar cell), voltage across each solar cell and others. Firstly, we filter and preprocess the obtained images using gamma removal and Gaussian filtering methods alongside some predefined processes like normalization. The first application is to detect whether a solar cell is dusty or not based on various pre-determined metrics like shadowing, leaf, droppings, air pollution and from other human activities to extent of fine-granular solar modules. The other one is detecting faults and other such occurrences on solar panels like faults, cracks, cell malfunction using thermal imaging application. This centralized platform can be vital since solar panels have different efficiency across different geography (air and heat affect) and can also be utilized for small-scale house requirements to large-scale solar farm sustentation effectively. It incorporates CNN, ResNet models that with self-attention mechanisms-KerNet model which are used for classification and results in a fine-tuned system that detects dust or any fault occurring. Thus, this multi-application model proves to be efficient and optimized in detecting dust and faults on solar panels. We have performed various comparisons and findings that demonstrates that our model has better efficiency and accuracy results overall than existing models.</description>

      <title>Breaking Forgetting: Training-Free Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Conditional Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts to overcome catastrophic forgetting in Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) have primarily focused on developing more effective gradient-based optimization strategies. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the training cost explosion that inevitably arises as the number of novel classes increases, a consequence of relying on gradient learning even under extreme data scarcity. More critically, since FSCIL typically provides only a few samples for each new class, gradient-based updates not only induce severe catastrophic forgetting on base classes but also hinder adaptation to novel ones. This paper seeks to break this long-standing limitation by asking: Can we design a training-free FSCIL paradigm that entirely removes gradient optimization? We provide an affirmative answer by uncovering an intriguing connection between gradient-based optimization and the Conditional Diffusion process. Building on this observation, we propose a Conditional Diffusion-driven FSCIL (CD-FSCIL) framework that substitutes the conventional gradient update process with a diffusion-based generative transition, enabling training-free incremental adaptation while effectively mitigating forgetting. Furthermore, to enhance representation under few-shot constraints, we introduce a multimodal learning strategy that integrates visual features with natural language descriptions automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). This synergy substantially alleviates the sample scarcity issue and improves generalization across novel classes. Extensive experiments on mainstream FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also drastically reduces computational and memory overhead, marking a paradigm shift toward training-free continual adaptation.</description>

      <title>DE-KAN: A Kolmogorov Arnold Network with Dual Encoder for accurate 2D Teeth Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of individual teeth from panoramic radiographs remains a challenging task due to anatomical variations, irregular tooth shapes, and overlapping structures. These complexities often limit the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this, we propose DE-KAN, a novel Dual Encoder Kolmogorov Arnold Network, which enhances feature representation and segmentation precision. The framework employs a ResNet-18 encoder for augmented inputs and a customized CNN encoder for original inputs, enabling the complementary extraction of global and local spatial features. These features are fused through KAN-based bottleneck layers, incorporating nonlinear learnable activation functions derived from the Kolmogorov Arnold representation theorem to improve learning capacity and interpretability. Extensive experiments on two benchmark dental X-ray datasets demonstrate that DE-KAN outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation models, achieving mIoU of 94.5%, Dice coefficient of 97.1%, accuracy of 98.91%, and recall of 97.36%, representing up to +4.7% improvement in Dice compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>HiFi-MambaV2: Hierarchical Shared-Routed MoE for High-Fidelity MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data requires recovering high-frequency details while maintaining anatomical coherence. We present HiFi-MambaV2, a hierarchical shared-routed Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Mamba architecture that couples frequency decomposition with content-adaptive computation. The model comprises two core components: (i) a separable frequency-consistent Laplacian pyramid (SF-Lap) that delivers alias-resistant, stable low- and high-frequency streams; and (ii) a hierarchical shared-routed MoE that performs per-pixel top-1 sparse dispatch to shared experts and local routers, enabling effective specialization with stable cross-depth behavior. A lightweight global context path is fused into an unrolled, data-consistency-regularized backbone to reinforce long-range reasoning and preserve anatomical coherence. Evaluated on fastMRI, CC359, ACDC, M4Raw, and Prostate158, HiFi-MambaV2 consistently outperforms CNN-, Transformer-, and prior Mamba-based baselines in PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE across single- and multi-coil settings and multiple acceleration factors, consistently surpassing consistent improvements in high-frequency detail and overall structural fidelity. These results demonstrate that HiFi-MambaV2 enables reliable and robust MRI reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Video Deraining with Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing video deraining methods are often trained on paired datasets, either synthetic, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world rain, or captured by static cameras, which restricts their effectiveness in dynamic scenes with background and camera motion. Furthermore, recent works in fine-tuning diffusion models have shown promising results, but the fine-tuning tends to weaken the generative prior, limiting generalization to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce the first zero-shot video deraining method for complex dynamic scenes that does not require synthetic data nor model fine-tuning, by leveraging a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. By inverting an input video into the latent space of diffusion models, its reconstruction process can be intervened and pushed away from the model's concept of rain using negative prompting. At the core of our approach is an attention switching mechanism that we found is crucial for maintaining dynamic backgrounds as well as structural consistency between the input and the derained video, mitigating artifacts introduced by naive negative prompting. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on real-world rain datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods and showcasing robust generalization without the need for supervised training.</description>

      <title>C3Po: Cross-View Cross-Modality Correspondence by Pointmap Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric models like DUSt3R have shown great advances in understanding the geometry of a scene from pairs of photos. However, they fail when the inputs are from vastly different viewpoints (e.g., aerial vs. ground) or modalities (e.g., photos vs. abstract drawings) compared to what was observed during training. This paper addresses a challenging version of this problem: predicting correspondences between ground-level photos and floor plans. Current datasets for joint photo--floor plan reasoning are limited, either lacking in varying modalities (VIGOR) or lacking in correspondences (WAFFLE). To address these limitations, we introduce a new dataset, C3, created by first reconstructing a number of scenes in 3D from Internet photo collections via structure-from-motion, then manually registering the reconstructions to floor plans gathered from the Internet, from which we can derive correspondence between images and floor plans. C3 contains 90K paired floor plans and photos across 597 scenes with 153M pixel-level correspondences and 85K camera poses. We find that state-of-the-art correspondence models struggle on this task. By training on our new data, we can improve on the best performing method by 34% in RMSE. We also identify open challenges in cross-modal geometric reasoning that our dataset aims to help address.</description>

      <title>PhysGS: Bayesian-Inferred Gaussian Splatting for Physical Property Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding physical properties such as friction, stiffness, hardness, and material composition is essential for enabling robots to interact safely and effectively with their surroundings. However, existing 3D reconstruction methods focus on geometry and appearance and cannot infer these underlying physical properties. We present PhysGS, a Bayesian-inferred extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that estimates dense, per-point physical properties from visual cues and vision--language priors. We formulate property estimation as Bayesian inference over Gaussian splats, where material and property beliefs are iteratively refined as new observations arrive. PhysGS also models aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, enabling uncertainty-aware object and scene interpretation. Across object-scale (ABO-500), indoor, and outdoor real-world datasets, PhysGS improves accuracy of the mass estimation by up to 22.8%, reduces Shore hardness error by up to 61.2%, and lowers kinetic friction error by up to 18.1% compared to deterministic baselines. Our results demonstrate that PhysGS unifies 3D reconstruction, uncertainty modeling, and physical reasoning in a single, spatially continuous framework for dense physical property estimation. Additional results are available at https://samchopra2003.github.io/physgs.</description>

      <title>Zero-Reference Joint Low-Light Enhancement and Deblurring via Visual Autoregressive Modeling with VLM-Derived Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world dark images commonly exhibit not only low visibility and contrast but also complex noise and blur, posing significant restoration challenges. Existing methods often rely on paired data or fail to model dynamic illumination and blur characteristics, leading to poor generalization. To tackle this, we propose a generative framework based on visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, guided by perceptual priors from the vision-language model (VLM). Specifically, to supply informative conditioning cues for VAR models, we deploy an adaptive curve estimation scheme to modulate the diverse illumination based on VLM-derived visibility scores. In addition, we integrate dynamic and spatial-frequency-aware Rotary Positional Encodings (SF-RoPE) into VAR to enhance its ability to model structures degraded by blur. Furthermore, we propose a recursive phase-domain modulation strategy that mitigates blur-induced artifacts in the phase domain via bounded iterative refinement guided by VLM-assessed blur scores. Our framework is fully unsupervised and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Stage-Specific Benchmarking of Deep Learning Models for Glioblastoma Follow-Up MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiating true tumor progression (TP) from treatment-related pseudoprogression (PsP) in glioblastoma remains challenging, especially at early follow-up. We present the first stage-specific, cross-sectional benchmarking of deep learning models for follow-up MRI using the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n = 180). We analyze different post-RT scans independently to test whether architecture performance depends on time-point. Eleven representative DL families (CNNs, LSTMs, hybrids, transformers, and selective state-space models) were trained under a unified, QC-driven pipeline with patient-level cross-validation. Across both stages, accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74), but discrimination improved at the second follow-up, with F1 and AUC increasing for several models, indicating richer separability later in the care pathway. A Mamba+CNN hybrid consistently offered the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformer variants delivered competitive AUCs at substantially higher computational cost and lightweight CNNs were efficient but less reliable. Performance also showed sensitivity to batch size, underscoring the need for standardized training protocols. Notably, absolute discrimination remained modest overall, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of TP vs. PsP and the dataset's size imbalance. These results establish a stage-aware benchmark and motivate future work incorporating longitudinal modeling, multi-sequence MRI, and larger multi-center cohorts.</description>

      <title>NeAR: Coupled Neural Asset-Renderer Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural asset authoring and neural rendering have emerged as fundamentally disjoint threads: one generates digital assets using neural networks for traditional graphics pipelines, while the other develops neural renderers that map conventional assets to images. However, the potential of jointly designing the asset representation and renderer remains largely unexplored. We argue that coupling them can unlock an end-to-end learnable graphics stack with benefits in fidelity, consistency, and efficiency. In this paper, we explore this possibility with NeAR: a Coupled Neural Asset-Renderer Stack. On the asset side, we build on Trellis-style Structured 3D Latents and introduce a lighting-homogenized neural asset: from a casually lit input, a rectified-flow backbone predicts a Lighting-Homogenized SLAT that encodes geometry and intrinsic material cues in a compact, view-agnostic latent. On the renderer side, we design a lighting-aware neural renderer that uses this neural asset, along with explicit view embeddings and HDR environment maps, to achieve real-time, relightable rendering. We validate NeAR on four tasks: (1) G-buffer-based forward rendering, (2) random-lit single-image reconstruction, (3) unknown-lit single-image relighting, and (4) novel-view relighting. Our coupled stack surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality. We hope this coupled asset-renderer perspective inspires future graphics stacks that view neural assets and renderers as co-designed components instead of independent entities.</description>

      <title>RigAnyFace: Scaling Neural Facial Mesh Auto-Rigging with Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present RigAnyFace (RAF), a scalable neural auto-rigging framework for facial meshes of diverse topologies, including those with multiple disconnected components. RAF deforms a static neutral facial mesh into industry-standard FACS poses to form an expressive blendshape rig. Deformations are predicted by a triangulation-agnostic surface learning network augmented with our tailored architecture design to condition on FACS parameters and efficiently process disconnected components. For training, we curated a dataset of facial meshes, with a subset meticulously rigged by professional artists to serve as accurate 3D ground truth for deformation supervision. Due to the high cost of manual rigging, this subset is limited in size, constraining the generalization ability of models trained exclusively on it. To address this, we design a 2D supervision strategy for unlabeled neutral meshes without rigs. This strategy increases data diversity and allows for scaled training, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of models trained on this augmented data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAF is able to rig meshes of diverse topologies on not only our artist-crafted assets but also in-the-wild samples, outperforming previous works in accuracy and generalizability. Moreover, our method advances beyond prior work by supporting multiple disconnected components, such as eyeballs, for more detailed expression animation.

      <title>Functional Localization Enforced Deep Anomaly Detection Using Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable detection of retinal diseases from fundus images is challenged by the variability in imaging quality, subtle early-stage manifestations, and domain shift across datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluated a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier under multiple augmentation and enhancement strategies across several heterogeneous public datasets, as well as the AEyeDB dataset, a high-quality fundus dataset created in-house and made available for the research community. The ViT demonstrated consistently strong performance, with accuracies ranging from 0.789 to 0.843 across datasets and diseases. Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration were detected reliably, whereas glaucoma remained the most frequently misclassified disease. Geometric and color augmentations provided the most stable improvements, while histogram equalization benefited datasets dominated by structural subtlety. Laplacian enhancement reduced performance across different settings.
  On the Papila dataset, the ViT with geometric augmentation achieved an AUC of 0.91, outperforming previously reported convolutional ensemble baselines (AUC of 0.87), underscoring the advantages of transformer architectures and multi-dataset training. To complement the classifier, we developed a GANomaly-based anomaly detector, achieving an AUC of 0.76 while providing inherent reconstruction-based explainability and robust generalization to unseen data. Probabilistic calibration using GUESS enabled threshold-independent decision support for future clinical implementation.</description>

      <title>Health system learning achieves generalist neuroimaging models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's DINOv3, have advanced rapidly through training on internet-scale public data, yet such systems lack access to private clinical data. Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.</description>

      <title>From Healthy Scans to Annotated Tumors: A Tumor Fabrication Framework for 3D Brain MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of annotated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) tumor data presents a major obstacle to accurate and automated tumor segmentation. While existing data synthesis methods offer promising solutions, they often suffer from key limitations: manual modeling is labor intensive and requires expert knowledge. Deep generative models may be used to augment data and annotation, but they typically demand large amounts of training pairs in the first place, which is impractical in data limited clinical settings. In this work, we propose Tumor Fabrication (TF), a novel two-stage framework for unpaired 3D brain tumor synthesis. The framework comprises a coarse tumor synthesis process followed by a refinement process powered by a generative model. TF is fully automated and leverages only healthy image scans along with a limited amount of real annotated data to synthesize large volumes of paired synthetic data for enriching downstream supervised segmentation training. We demonstrate that our synthetic image-label pairs used as data enrichment can significantly improve performance on downstream tumor segmentation tasks in low-data regimes, offering a scalable and reliable solution for medical image enrichment and addressing critical challenges in data scarcity for clinical AI applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Physical Adversarial Patches Using Dynamically Optimized Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical adversarial attacks on deep learning systems is concerning due to the ease of deploying such attacks, usually by placing an adversarial patch in a scene to manipulate the outcomes of a deep learning model. Training such patches typically requires regularization that improves physical realizability (e.g., printability, smoothness) and/or robustness to real-world variability (e.g. deformations, viewing angle, noise). One type of variability that has received little attention is scale variability. When a patch is rescaled, either digitally through downsampling/upsampling or physically through changing imaging distances, interpolation-induced color mixing occurs. This smooths out pixel values, resulting in a loss of high-frequency patterns and degrading the adversarial signal. To address this, we present a novel superpixel-based regularization method that guides patch optimization to scale-resilient structures. Our ap proach employs the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to dynamically cluster pixels in an adversarial patch during optimization. The Implicit Function Theorem is used to backpropagate gradients through SLIC to update the superpixel boundaries and color. This produces patches that maintain their structure over scale and are less susceptible to interpolation losses. Our method achieves greater performance in the digital domain, and when realized physically, these performance gains are preserved, leading to improved physical performance. Real-world performance was objectively assessed using a novel physical evaluation protocol that utilizes screens and cardboard cut-outs to systematically vary real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation Strategies for Robust Lane Marking Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust lane detection is essential for advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving, yet models trained on public datasets such as CULane often fail to generalise across different camera viewpoints. This paper addresses the challenge of domain shift for side-mounted cameras used in lane-wheel monitoring by introducing a generative AI-based data enhancement pipeline. The approach combines geometric perspective transformation, AI-driven inpainting, and vehicle body overlays to simulate deployment-specific viewpoints while preserving lane continuity. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation in two state-of-the-art models, SCNN and UFLDv2. With the augmented data trained, both models show improved robustness to different conditions, including shadows. The experimental results demonstrate gains in precision, recall, and F1 score compared to the pre-trained model.
  By bridging the gap between widely available datasets and deployment-specific scenarios, our method provides a scalable and practical framework to improve the reliability of lane detection in a pilot deployment scenario.</description>

      <title>Sphinx: Efficiently Serving Novel View Synthesis using Regression-Guided Selective Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is the task of generating new images of a scene from viewpoints that were not part of the original input. Diffusion-based NVS can generate high-quality, temporally consistent images, however, remains computationally prohibitive. Conversely, regression-based NVS offers suboptimal generation quality despite requiring significantly lower compute; leaving the design objective of a high-quality, inference-efficient NVS framework an open challenge. To close this critical gap, we present Sphinx, a training-free hybrid inference framework that achieves diffusion-level fidelity at a significantly lower compute. Sphinx proposes to use regression-based fast initialization to guide and reduce the denoising workload for the diffusion model. Additionally, it integrates selective refinement with adaptive noise scheduling, allowing more compute to uncertain regions and frames. This enables Sphinx to provide flexible navigation of the performance-quality trade-off, allowing adaptation to latency and fidelity requirements for dynamically changing inference scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Sphinx achieves an average 1.8x speedup over diffusion model inference with negligible perceptual degradation of less than 5%, establishing a new Pareto frontier between quality and latency in NVS serving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers have shown remarkable generalization in visual synthesis, yet most dense perception methods still rely on text-to-image (T2I) generators designed for stochastic generation. We revisit this paradigm and show that image editing diffusion models are inherently image-to-image consistent, providing a more suitable foundation for dense perception task. We introduce Edit2Perceive, a unified diffusion framework that adapts editing models for depth, normal, and matting. Built upon the FLUX.1 Kontext architecture, our approach employs full-parameter fine-tuning and a pixel-space consistency loss to enforce structure-preserving refinement across intermediate denoising states. Moreover, our single-step deterministic inference yields up to faster runtime while training on relatively small datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate comprehensive state-of-the-art results across all three tasks, revealing the strong potential of editing-oriented diffusion transformers for geometry-aware perception.</description>

      <title>MedVision: Dataset and Benchmark for Quantitative Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine are primarily designed for categorical question answering (e.g., "Is this normal or abnormal?") or qualitative descriptive tasks. However, clinical decision-making often relies on quantitative assessments, such as measuring the size of a tumor or the angle of a joint, from which physicians draw their own diagnostic conclusions. This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs. We focus on three representative quantitative tasks: (1) detection of anatomical structures and abnormalities, (2) tumor/lesion (T/L) size estimation, and (3) angle/distance (A/D) measurement. Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision. This work provides a foundation for developing VLMs with robust quantitative reasoning capabilities in medical imaging. Code and data are available at https://medvision-vlm.github.io.</description>

      <title>A Theory-Inspired Framework for Few-Shot Cross-Modal Sketch Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sketch based person re-identification aims to match hand-drawn sketches with RGB surveillance images, but remains challenging due to significant modality gaps and limited annotated data. To address this, we introduce KTCAA, a theoretically grounded framework for few-shot cross-modal generalization. Motivated by generalization theory, we identify two key factors influencing target domain risk: (1) domain discrepancy, which quantifies the alignment difficulty between source and target distributions; and (2) perturbation invariance, which evaluates the model's robustness to modality shifts. Based on these insights, we propose two components: (1) Alignment Augmentation (AA), which applies localized sketch-style transformations to simulate target distributions and facilitate progressive alignment; and (2) Knowledge Transfer Catalyst (KTC), which enhances invariance by introducing worst-case perturbations and enforcing consistency. These modules are jointly optimized under a meta-learning paradigm that transfers alignment knowledge from data-rich RGB domains to sketch-based scenarios. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KTCAA achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions.</description>

      <title>Neural Geometry Image-Based Representations with Optimal Transport (OT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural representations for 3D meshes are emerging as an effective solution for compact storage and efficient processing. Existing methods often rely on neural overfitting, where a coarse mesh is stored and progressively refined through multiple decoder networks. While this can restore high-quality surfaces, it is computationally expensive due to successive decoding passes and the irregular structure of mesh data. In contrast, images have a regular structure that enables powerful super-resolution and restoration frameworks, but applying these advantages to meshes is difficult because their irregular connectivity demands complex encoder-decoder architectures. Our key insight is that a geometry image-based representation transforms irregular meshes into a regular image grid, making efficient image-based neural processing directly applicable. Building on this idea, we introduce our neural geometry image-based representation, which is decoder-free, storage-efficient, and naturally suited for neural processing. It stores a low-resolution geometry-image mipmap of the surface, from which high-quality meshes are restored in a single forward pass. To construct geometry images, we leverage Optimal Transport (OT), which resolves oversampling in flat regions and undersampling in feature-rich regions, and enables continuous levels of detail (LoD) through geometry-image mipmapping. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art storage efficiency and restoration accuracy, measured by compression ratio (CR), Chamfer distance (CD), and Hausdorff distance (HD).</description>

      <title>Hierarchical GraphCut Phase Unwrapping based on Invariance of Diffeomorphisms Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid advancements in 3D scanning technologies, with applications spanning VR/AR, digital human creation, and medical imaging. Structured-light scanning with phase-shifting techniques is preferred for its use of low-intensity visible light and high accuracy, making it well suited for capturing 4D facial dynamics. A key step is phase unwrapping, which recovers continuous phase values from measurements wrapped modulo 2pi. The goal is to estimate the unwrapped phase count k in the equation Phi = phi + 2pi k, where phi is the wrapped phase and Phi is the true phase. Noise, occlusions, and complex 3D geometry make recovering the true phase challenging because phase unwrapping is ill-posed: measurements only provide modulo 2pi values, and estimating k requires assumptions about surface continuity. Existing methods trade speed for accuracy: fast approaches lack precision, while accurate algorithms are too slow for real-time use. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a phase unwrapping framework that reformulates GraphCut-based unwrapping as a pixel-labeling problem. This framework improves the estimation of the unwrapped phase count k through the invariance property of diffeomorphisms applied in image space via conformal and optimal transport (OT) maps. An odd number of diffeomorphisms are precomputed from the input phase data, and a hierarchical GraphCut algorithm is applied in each domain. The resulting label maps are fused via majority voting to robustly estimate k at each pixel. Experimental results demonstrate a 45.5x speedup and lower L2 error in real experiments and simulations, showing potential for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Now You See It, Now You Don't - Instant Concept Erasure for Safe Text-to-Image and Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust concept removal for text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) models is essential for their safe deployment. Existing methods, however, suffer from costly retraining, inference overhead, or vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Crucially, they rarely model the latent semantic overlap between the target erase concept and surrounding content -- causing collateral damage post-erasure -- and even fewer methods work reliably across both T2I and T2V domains. We introduce Instant Concept Erasure (ICE), a training-free, modality-agnostic, one-shot weight modification approach that achieves precise, persistent unlearning with zero overhead. ICE defines erase and preserve subspaces using anisotropic energy-weighted scaling, then explicitly regularises against their intersection using a unique, closed-form overlap projector. We pose a convex and Lipschitz-bounded Spectral Unlearning Objective, balancing erasure fidelity and intersection preservation, that admits a stable and unique analytical solution. This solution defines a dissociation operator that is translated to the model's text-conditioning layers, making the edit permanent and runtime-free. Across targeted removals of artistic styles, objects, identities, and explicit content, ICE efficiently achieves strong erasure with improved robustness to red-teaming, all while causing only minimal degradation of original generative abilities in both T2I and T2V models.</description>

      <title>Beyond Description: Cognitively Benchmarking Fine-Grained Action for Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results as decision-making engines for embodied agents operating in complex, physical environments. However, existing benchmarks often prioritize high-level planning or spatial reasoning, leaving the fine-grained action intelligence required for embodied physical interaction underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CFG-Bench, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate this crucial capability. CFG-Bench consists of 1,368 curated videos paired with 19,562 three-modalities question-answer pairs targeting four cognitive abilities: 1) Physical Interaction, 2) Temporal-Causal Relation, 3) Intentional Understanding, and 4) Evaluative Judgment. Together, these dimensions provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to translate visual observations into actionable knowledge, moving beyond mere surface-level recognition. Our comprehensive evaluation on CFG-Bench reveals that leading MLLMs struggle to produce detailed instructions for physical interactions and exhibit profound limitations in the higher-order reasoning of intention and evaluation. Moreover, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our data demonstrates that teaching an MLLMs to articulate fine-grained actions directly translates to significant performance gains on established embodied benchmarks. Our analysis highlights these limitations and offers insights for developing more capable and grounded embodied agents.</description>

      <title>EVCC: Enhanced Vision Transformer-ConvNeXt-CoAtNet Fusion for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid vision architectures combining Transformers and CNNs have significantly advanced image classification, but they usually do so at significant computational cost. We introduce EVCC (Enhanced Vision Transformer-ConvNeXt-CoAtNet), a novel multi-branch architecture integrating the Vision Transformer, lightweight ConvNeXt, and CoAtNet through key innovations: (1) adaptive token pruning with information preservation, (2) gated bidirectional cross-attention for enhanced feature refinement, (3) auxiliary classification heads for multi-task learning, and (4) a dynamic router gate employing context-aware confidence-driven weighting. Experiments across the CIFAR-100, Tobacco3482, CelebA, and Brain Cancer datasets demonstrate EVCC's superiority over powerful models like DeiT-Base, MaxViT-Base, and CrossViT-Base by consistently achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with improvements of up to 2 percentage points, while reducing FLOPs by 25 to 35%. Our adaptive architecture adjusts computational demands to deployment needs by dynamically reducing token count, efficiently balancing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off while combining global context, local details, and hierarchical features for real-world applications. The source code of our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EVCC.</description>

      <title>Exploring Surround-View Fisheye Camera 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the technical feasibility of implementing end-to-end 3D object detection (3DOD) with surround-view fisheye camera system. Specifically, we first investigate the performance drop incurred when transferring classic pinhole-based 3D object detectors to fisheye imagery. To mitigate this, we then develop two methods that incorporate the unique geometry of fisheye images into mainstream detection frameworks: one based on the bird's-eye-view (BEV) paradigm, named FisheyeBEVDet, and the other on the query-based paradigm, named FisheyePETR. Both methods adopt spherical spatial representations to effectively capture fisheye geometry. In light of the lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks, we release Fisheye3DOD, a new open dataset synthesized using CARLA and featuring both standard pinhole and fisheye camera arrays. Experiments on Fisheye3DOD show that our fisheye-compatible modeling improves accuracy by up to 6.2% over baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Dendritic Convolution for Noise Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios of image recognition, there exists substantial noise interference. Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck. However, little is known about the exploration of anti-interference solutions from a neuronal perspective.This paper proposes an anti-noise neuronal convolution. This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%. The consistency between the computation method of this convolution and the dendrites of biological neurons enables it to perform significantly better than traditional convolution in complex noisy environments.</description>

      <title>ObjectAlign: Neuro-Symbolic Object Consistency Verification and Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video editing and synthesis often introduce object inconsistencies, such as frame flicker and identity drift that degrade perceptual quality. To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed "consistent" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes. Our results show up to 1.4 point improvement in CLIP Score and up to 6.1 point improvement in warp error compared to SOTA baselines on the DAVIS and Pexels video datasets.</description>

      <title>CoD: A Diffusion Foundation Model for Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing diffusion codecs typically build on text-to-image diffusion foundation models like Stable Diffusion. However, text conditioning is suboptimal from a compression perspective, hindering the potential of downstream diffusion codecs, particularly at ultra-low bitrates. To address it, we introduce \textbf{CoD}, the first \textbf{Co}mpression-oriented \textbf{D}iffusion foundation model, trained from scratch to enable end-to-end optimization of both compression and generation. CoD is not a fixed codec but a general foundation model designed for various diffusion-based codecs. It offers several advantages: \textbf{High compression efficiency}, replacing Stable Diffusion with CoD in downstream codecs like DiffC achieves SOTA results, especially at ultra-low bitrates (e.g., 0.0039 bpp); \textbf{Low-cost and reproducible training}, 300$\times$ faster training than Stable Diffusion ($\sim$ 20 vs. $\sim$ 6,250 A100 GPU days) on entirely open image-only datasets; \textbf{Providing new insights}, e.g., We find pixel-space diffusion can achieve VTM-level PSNR with high perceptual quality and can outperform GAN-based codecs using fewer parameters. We hope CoD lays the foundation for future diffusion codec research. Codes will be released.</description>

      <title>Modality-Collaborative Low-Rank Decomposers for Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging task of Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation (FSVDA). The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and subrouters, enhancing their diversity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain activation consistency loss to guarantee that target and source samples of the same category exhibit consistent activation preferences of the decomposers, thereby facilitating domain alignment. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</description>

      <title>DriveFlow: Rectified Flow Adaptation for Robust 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, vision-centric 3D object detection recognizes and localizes 3D objects from RGB images. However, due to high annotation costs and diverse outdoor scenes, training data often fails to cover all possible test scenarios, known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. Training-free image editing offers a promising solution for improving model robustness by training data enhancement without any modifications to pre-trained diffusion models. Nevertheless, inversion-based methods often suffer from limited effectiveness and inherent inaccuracies, while recent rectified-flow-based approaches struggle to preserve objects with accurate 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose DriveFlow, a Rectified Flow Adaptation method for training data enhancement in autonomous driving based on pre-trained Text-to-Image flow models. Based on frequency decomposition, DriveFlow introduces two strategies to adapt noise-free editing paths derived from text-conditioned velocities. 1) High-Frequency Foreground Preservation: DriveFlow incorporates a high-frequency alignment loss for foreground to maintain precise 3D object geometry. 2) Dual-Frequency Background Optimization: DriveFlow also conducts dual-frequency optimization for background, balancing editing flexibility and semantic consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of DriveFlow, demonstrating comprehensive performance improvements on all categories across OOD scenarios.

      <title>Seeing What Matters: Visual Preference Policy Optimization for Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for post-training visual generative models, with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) increasingly used to align generators with human preferences. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on a single scalar reward per sample, treating each image or video as a holistic entity and ignoring the rich spatial and temporal structure of visual content. This coarse supervision hinders the correction of localized artifacts and the modeling of fine-grained perceptual cues. We introduce Visual Preference Policy Optimization (ViPO), a GRPO variant that lifts scalar feedback into structured, pixel-level advantages. ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module that uses pretrained vision backbones to construct spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure toward perceptually important regions while preserving the stability of standard GRPO. Across both image and video benchmarks, ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO, improving in-domain alignment with human-preference rewards and enhancing generalization on out-of-domain evaluations. The method is architecture-agnostic, lightweight, and fully compatible with existing GRPO training pipelines, providing a more expressive and informative learning signal for visual generation.</description>

      <title>GuideFlow: Constraint-Guided Flow Matching for Planning in End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving planning is a critical component of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, prevailing Imitative E2E Planners often suffer from multimodal trajectory mode collapse, failing to produce diverse trajectory proposals. Meanwhile, Generative E2E Planners struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs. In this paper, we propose \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}}, a novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals. Our core contribution lies in directly enforcing explicit constraints within the flow matching generation process, rather than relying on implicit constraint encoding. Crucially, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} unifies the training of the flow matching with the Energy-Based Model (EBM) to enhance the model's autonomous optimization capability to robustly satisfy physical constraints. Secondly, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Extensive evaluations on major driving benchmarks (Bench2Drive, NuScenes, NavSim and ADV-NuScenes) validate the effectiveness of \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}}. Notably, on the NavSim test hard split (Navhard), \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} achieved SOTA with an EPDMS score of 43.0. The code will be released.</description>

      <title>Yo'City: Personalized and Boundless 3D Realistic City Scene Generation via Self-Critic Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic 3D city generation is fundamental to a wide range of applications, including virtual reality and digital twins. However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical "City-District-Grid" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a "produce-refine-evaluate" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects.</description>

      <title>Thinking Ahead: Foresight Intelligence in MLLMs and World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we define Foresight Intelligence as the capability to anticipate and interpret future events-an ability essential for applications such as autonomous driving, yet largely overlooked by existing research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FSU-QA, a new Visual Question-Answering (VQA) dataset specifically designed to elicit and evaluate Foresight Intelligence. Using FSU-QA, we conduct the first comprehensive study of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under foresight-oriented tasks, revealing that current models still struggle to reason about future situations. Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin. Together, these findings position FSU-QA as a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of truly anticipating and understanding future events.</description>

      <title>ProxT2I: Efficient Reward-Guided Text-to-Image Generation via Proximal Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generative modeling across a wide range of domains, including prompt-conditional generation. The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a \textit{"GPT moment"} in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: \textit{the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions}. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{Primitive Embodied World Models} (PEWM), which restricts video generation to fixed shorter horizons, our approach \textit{1) enables} fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, \textit{2) reduces} learning complexity, \textit{3) improves} data efficiency in embodied data collection, and \textit{4) decreases} inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>From Features to Reference Points: Lightweight and Adaptive Fusion for Cooperative Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present RefPtsFusion, a lightweight and interpretable framework for cooperative autonomous driving. Instead of sharing large feature maps or query embeddings, vehicles exchange compact reference points, e.g., objects' positions, velocities, and size information. This approach shifts the focus from "what is seen" to "where to see", creating a sensor- and model-independent interface that works well across vehicles with heterogeneous perception models while greatly reducing communication bandwidth. To enhance the richness of shared information, we further develop a selective Top-K query fusion that selectively adds high-confidence queries from the sender. It thus achieves a strong balance between accuracy and communication cost. Experiments on the M3CAD dataset show that RefPtsFusion maintains stable perception performance while reducing communication overhead by five orders of magnitude, dropping from hundreds of MB/s to only a few KB/s at 5 FPS (frame per second), compared to traditional feature-level fusion methods. Extensive experiments also demonstrate RefPtsFusion's strong robustness and consistent transmission behavior, highlighting its potential for scalable, real-time cooperative driving systems.</description>

      <title>VAOT: Vessel-Aware Optimal Transport for Retinal Fundus Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color fundus photography (CFP) is central to diagnosing and monitoring retinal disease, yet its acquisition variability (e.g., illumination changes) often degrades image quality, which motivates robust enhancement methods. Unpaired enhancement pipelines are typically GAN-based, however, they can distort clinically critical vasculature, altering vessel topology and endpoint integrity. Motivated by these structural alterations, we propose Vessel-Aware Optimal Transport (\textbf{VAOT}), a framework that combines an optimal-transport objective with two structure-preserving regularizers: (i) a skeleton-based loss to maintain global vascular connectivity and (ii) an endpoint-aware loss to stabilize local termini. These constraints guide learning in the unpaired setting, reducing noise while preserving vessel structure. Experimental results on synthetic degradation benchmark and downstream evaluations in vessel and lesion segmentation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods against several state-of-the art baselines.

      <title>NI-Tex: Non-isometric Image-based Garment Texture Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing industrial 3D garment meshes already cover most real-world clothing geometries, yet their texture diversity remains limited. To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Multi-View Visual Anomaly Detection via Progressive Homography-Guided Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised visual anomaly detection from multi-view images presents a significant challenge: distinguishing genuine defects from benign appearance variations caused by viewpoint changes. Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Garment Conditioning in Diffusion-based Virtual Try-On</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Try-On (VTON) is the task of synthesizing an image of a person wearing a target garment, conditioned on a person image and a garment image. While diffusion-based VTON models featuring a Dual UNet architecture demonstrate superior fidelity compared to single UNet models, they incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa. Our results demonstrate improved FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, with only a marginal decrease in SSIM, establishing a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models.</description>

      <title>ConceptGuard: Proactive Safety in Text-and-Image-to-Video Generation through Multimodal Risk Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in video generative models has enabled the creation of high-quality videos from multimodal prompts that combine text and images. While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.</description>

      <title>A Novel Dual-Stream Framework for dMRI Tractography Streamline Classification with Joint dMRI and fMRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streamline classification is essential to identify anatomically meaningful white matter tracts from diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, current streamline classification methods rely primarily on the geometric features of the streamline trajectory, failing to distinguish between functionally distinct fiber tracts with similar pathways. To address this, we introduce a novel dual-stream streamline classification framework that jointly analyzes dMRI and functional MRI (fMRI) data to enhance the functional coherence of tract parcellation. We design a novel network that performs streamline classification using a pretrained backbone model for full streamline trajectories, while augmenting with an auxiliary network that processes fMRI signals from fiber endpoint regions. We demonstrate our method by parcellating the corticospinal tract (CST) into its four somatotopic subdivisions. Experimental results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate our approach's superior performance.</description>

      <title>STCDiT: Spatio-Temporally Consistent Diffusion Transformer for High-Quality Video Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present STCDiT, a video super-resolution framework built upon a pre-trained video diffusion model, aiming to restore structurally faithful and temporally stable videos from degraded inputs, even under complex camera motions. The main challenges lie in maintaining temporal stability during reconstruction and preserving structural fidelity during generation. To address these challenges, we first develop a motion-aware VAE reconstruction method that performs segment-wise reconstruction, with each segment clip exhibiting uniform motion characteristic, thereby effectively handling videos with complex camera motions. Moreover, we observe that the first-frame latent extracted by the VAE encoder in each clip, termed the anchor-frame latent, remains unaffected by temporal compression and retains richer spatial structural information than subsequent frame latents. We further develop an anchor-frame guidance approach that leverages structural information from anchor frames to constrain the generation process and improve structural fidelity of video features. Coupling these two designs enables the video diffusion model to achieve high-quality video super-resolution. Extensive experiments show that STCDiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of structural fidelity and temporal consistency.</description>

      <title>Understanding Task Transfer in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well on multimodal benchmarks but lag behind humans and specialized models on visual perception tasks like depth estimation or object counting. Finetuning on one task can unpredictably affect performance on others, making task-specific finetuning challenging. In this paper, we address this challenge through a systematic study of task transferability. We examine how finetuning a VLM on one perception task affects its zero-shot performance on others. To quantify these effects, we introduce Perfection Gap Factor (PGF), a metric that captures both the breadth and magnitude of transfer. Using three open-weight VLMs evaluated across 13 perception tasks, we construct a task-transfer graph that reveals previously unobserved relationships among perception tasks. Our analysis uncovers patterns of positive and negative transfer, identifies groups of tasks that mutually influence each other, organizes tasks into personas based on their transfer behavior and demonstrates how PGF can guide data selection for more efficient training. These findings highlight both opportunities for positive transfer and risks of negative interference, offering actionable guidance for advancing VLMs.</description>

      <title>StereoDETR: Stereo-based Transformer for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to monocular 3D object detection, stereo-based 3D methods offer significantly higher accuracy but still suffer from high computational overhead and latency. The state-of-the-art stereo 3D detection method achieves twice the accuracy of monocular approaches, yet its inference speed is only half as fast. In this paper, we propose StereoDETR, an efficient stereo 3D object detection framework based on DETR. StereoDETR consists of two branches: a monocular DETR branch and a stereo branch. The DETR branch is built upon 2D DETR with additional channels for predicting object scale, orientation, and sampling points. The stereo branch leverages low-cost multi-scale disparity features to predict object-level depth maps. These two branches are coupled solely through a differentiable depth sampling strategy. To handle occlusion, we introduce a constrained supervision strategy for sampling points without requiring extra annotations. StereoDETR achieves real-time inference and is the first stereo-based method to surpass monocular approaches in speed. It also achieves competitive accuracy on the public KITTI benchmark, setting new state-of-the-art results on pedestrian and cyclist subsets. The code is available at https://github.com/shiyi-mu/StereoDETR-OPEN.</description>

      <title>Scale What Counts, Mask What Matters: Evaluating Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Wi-Fi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Wi-Fi sensing offers a compelling, privacy-preserving alternative to cameras, its practical utility has been fundamentally undermined by a lack of robustness across domains. Models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, a critical "domain shift" problem exacerbated by modest, fragmented public datasets. We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline. Overall, our findings provide insightful direction for designing future Wi-Fi sensing systems that can eventually be robust enough for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>PartDiffuser: Part-wise 3D Mesh Generation via Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing autoregressive (AR) methods for generating artist-designed meshes struggle to balance global structural consistency with high-fidelity local details, and are susceptible to error accumulation. To address this, we propose PartDiffuser, a novel semi-autoregressive diffusion framework for point-cloud-to-mesh generation. The method first performs semantic segmentation on the mesh and then operates in a "part-wise" manner: it employs autoregression between parts to ensure global topology, while utilizing a parallel discrete diffusion process within each semantic part to precisely reconstruct high-frequency geometric features. PartDiffuser is based on the DiT architecture and introduces a part-aware cross-attention mechanism, using point clouds as hierarchical geometric conditioning to dynamically control the generation process, thereby effectively decoupling the global and local generation tasks. Experiments demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in generating 3D meshes with rich detail, exhibiting exceptional detail representation suitable for real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray imaging, based on penetration, enables detailed visualization of internal structures. Building on this capability, existing implicit 3D reconstruction methods have adapted the NeRF model and its variants for internal CT reconstruction. However, these approaches often neglect the significance of objects' anatomical priors for implicit learning, limiting both reconstruction precision and learning efficiency, particularly in ultra-sparse view scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D CT reconstruction framework that employs a 'target prior' derived from the object's projection data to enhance implicit learning. Our approach integrates positional and structural encoding to facilitate voxel-wise implicit reconstruction, utilizing the target prior to guide voxel sampling and enrich structural encoding. This dual strategy significantly boosts both learning efficiency and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a CUDA-based algorithm for rapid estimation of high-quality 3D target priors from sparse-view projections. Experiments utilizing projection data from a complex abdominal dataset demonstrate that the proposed model substantially enhances learning efficiency, outperforming the current leading model, NAF, by a factor of ten. In terms of reconstruction quality, it also exceeds the most accurate model, NeRP, achieving PSNR improvements of 3.57 dB, 5.42 dB, and 5.70 dB with 10, 20, and 30 projections, respectively.

      <title>Mitigating Long-Tail Bias in HOI Detection via Adaptive Diversity Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, empowering machines to comprehend human-object relationships in diverse real-world scenarios. Recent advances in VLMs have significantly improved HOI detection by leveraging rich cross-modal representations. However, most existing VLM-based approaches rely heavily on additional training or prompt tuning, resulting in substantial computational overhead and limited scalability, particularly in long-tailed scenarios where rare interactions are severely underrepresented. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Diversity Cache (ADC) module, a novel training-free and plug-and-play mechanism designed to mitigate long-tail bias in HOI detection. ADC constructs class-specific caches that accumulate high-confidence and diverse feature representations during inference. The method incorporates frequency-aware cache adaptation that favors rare categories and is designed to enable robust prediction calibration without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show that ADC consistently improves existing HOI detectors, achieving up to +8.57\% mAP gain on rare categories and +4.39\% on the full dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating long-tail bias while preserving overall performance.</description>

      <title>DetAny4D: Detect Anything 4D Temporally in a Streaming RGB Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable 4D object detection, which refers to 3D object detection in streaming video, is crucial for perceiving and understanding the real world. Existing open-set 4D object detection methods typically make predictions on a frame-by-frame basis without modeling temporal consistency, or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines that are prone to error propagation across cascaded stages. Progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets that capture continuous reliable 3D bounding box (b-box) annotations. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce DA4D, a large-scale 4D detection dataset containing over 280k sequences with high-quality b-box annotations collected under diverse conditions. Building on DA4D, we propose DetAny4D, an open-set end-to-end framework that predicts 3D b-boxes directly from sequential inputs. DetAny4D fuses multi-modal features from pre-trained foundational models and designs a geometry-aware spatiotemporal decoder to effectively capture both spatial and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, it adopts a multi-task learning architecture coupled with a dedicated training strategy to maintain global consistency across sequences of varying lengths. Extensive experiments show that DetAny4D achieves competitive detection accuracy and significantly improves temporal stability, effectively addressing long-standing issues of jitter and inconsistency in 4D object detection. Data and code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>SupLID: Geometrical Guidance for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in semantic segmentation aims to localize anomalous regions at the pixel level, advancing beyond traditional image-level OOD techniques to better suit real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Recent literature has successfully explored the adaptation of commonly used image-level OOD methods--primarily based on classifier-derived confidence scores (e.g., energy or entropy)--for this pixel-precise task. However, these methods inherit a set of limitations, including vulnerability to overconfidence. In this work, we introduce SupLID, a novel framework that effectively guides classifier-derived OOD scores by exploiting the geometrical structure of the underlying semantic space, particularly using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). While LID effectively characterizes the local structure of high-dimensional data by analyzing distance distributions, its direct application at the pixel level remains challenging. To overcome this, SupLID constructs a geometrical coreset that captures the intrinsic structure of the in-distribution (ID) subspace. It then computes OOD scores at the superpixel level, enabling both efficient real-time inference and improved spatial smoothness. We demonstrate that geometrical cues derived from SupLID serve as a complementary signal to traditional classifier confidence, enhancing the model's ability to detect diverse OOD scenarios. Designed as a post-hoc scoring method, SupLID can be seamlessly integrated with any semantic segmentation classifier at deployment time. Our results demonstrate that SupLID significantly enhances existing classifier-based OOD scores, achieving state-of-the-art performance across key evaluation metrics, including AUR, FPR, and AUP.

      <title>Disc3D: Automatic Curation of High-Quality 3D Dialog Data via Discriminative Object Referring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still lag behind their 2D peers, largely because large-scale, high-quality 3D scene-dialogue datasets remain scarce. Prior efforts hinge on expensive human annotation and leave two key ambiguities unresolved: viewpoint ambiguity, where spatial language presumes unknown camera poses, and object referring ambiguity, where non-exclusive descriptions blur the line between targets and distractors. We therefore present a fully automated pipeline that converts raw 3D scans into unambiguous, high-quality dialogue data at a fraction of the previous cost. By synergizing rule-based constraints with 2D MLLMs and LLMs, the pipeline enables controllable, scalable generation without human intervention. The pipeline comprises four stages: (1) meta-annotation collection harvesting object-, frame-, and scene-level captions, (2) scene graph construction with relation correction to capture proximal object relations, (3) discriminative object referring that generates exclusive and compact descriptions, and (4) multi-task data generation synthesizing diverse dialogues. Our pipeline systematically mitigates inherent flaws in source datasets and produces the final Disc3D dataset, over 2 million samples in 25K hybrid 3D scenes, spanning scene, view, and object captioning, visual grounding, and five object-centric QA tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with Disc3D yields consistent, significant improvements on both public benchmarks and our multifaceted Disc3D-QA tasks. Code, data, and models will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>DiP: Taming Diffusion Models in Pixel Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models face a fundamental trade-off between generation quality and computational efficiency. Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) offer an efficient solution but suffer from potential information loss and non-end-to-end training. In contrast, existing pixel space models bypass VAEs but are computationally prohibitive for high-resolution synthesis. To resolve this dilemma, we propose DiP, an efficient pixel space diffusion framework. DiP decouples generation into a global and a local stage: a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone operates on large patches for efficient global structure construction, while a co-trained lightweight Patch Detailer Head leverages contextual features to restore fine-grained local details. This synergistic design achieves computational efficiency comparable to LDMs without relying on a VAE. DiP is accomplished with up to 10$\times$ faster inference speeds than previous method while increasing the total number of parameters by only 0.3%, and achieves an 1.90 FID score on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</description>

      <title>VideoPerceiver: Enhancing Fine-Grained Temporal Perception in Video Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose VideoPerceiver, a novel video multimodal large language model (VMLLM) that enhances fine-grained perception in video understanding, addressing VMLLMs' limited ability to reason about brief actions in short clips or rare transient events in long videos. VideoPerceiver adopts a two-stage training framework. During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we construct "key-information-missing" videos by extracting event-action keywords from captions, identifying corresponding key frames, and replacing them with adjacent frames. We jointly encode original and modified video tokens with text tokens, aligning intermediate visual representations with keywords via an auxiliary contrastive loss to enhance sensitivity to fine-grained motion cues. In reinforcement learning (RL), both video variants are fed into the model to generate descriptions, and a novel relative reward ensures responses from complete videos outperform those from degraded inputs, explicitly training the model to recover temporally precise action details. We also curate a dataset of 80,000 videos with fine-grained actions and transient events. Experiments show VideoPerceiver substantially outperforms state-of-the-art VMLLMs on fine-grained action understanding and rare event captioning benchmarks, while maintaining strong performance on standard tasks. By prioritizing task-relevant visual features, our work redefines video-language model training for fine-grained perception.</description>

      <title>Assessing the alignment between infants' visual and linguistic experience using multimodal language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Figuring out which objects or concepts words refer to is a central language learning challenge for young children. Most models of this process posit that children learn early object labels from co-occurrences of words and their referents that occur when someone around them talks about an object in the immediate physical environment. But how aligned in time are children's visual and linguistic experiences during everyday learning? To date, answers to this question have been limited by the need for labor-intensive manual annotations of vision-language co-occurrences. Here, we evaluate the use of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) models to automatically characterize vision-language alignment in egocentric videos taken from the infant perspective in home environments. After validating CLIP alignment scores using human alignment judgments, we apply this metric to a large corpus of infant-perspective videos. We show that idealized aligned moments for learning (e.g., "look at the ball" with a ball present in the child's view) are relatively rare in children's everyday experiences compared to modern machine learning datasets, and highlight variability in alignment both within and across children. These findings suggest that infrequent alignment is a constraint for models describing early word learning and offer a new method for investigating children's multimodal environment.</description>

      <title>Q-Save: Towards Scoring and Attribution for Generated Video Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Q-Save, a new benchmark dataset and model for holistic and explainable evaluation of AI-generated video (AIGV) quality. The dataset contains near 10000 videos, each annotated with a scalar mean opinion score (MOS) and fine-grained attribution labels along three core dimensions: visual quality, dynamic quality, and text-video alignment. These multi-aspect annotations enable both accurate quality assessment and interpretable reasoning behind the scores. To leverage this data, we propose a unified evaluation model that jointly performs quality scoring and attribution-based explanation. The model adopts the SlowFast framework to distinguish between fast frames and slow frames - slow frames are processed with high resolution while fast frames use low resolution, balancing evaluation accuracy and computational efficiency. For training, we use data formatted in Chain-of-Thought (COT) style and employ a multi-stage strategy: we first conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), then further enhance the model with Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and finally perform SFT again to improve model stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality prediction while also providing human-aligned, interpretable justifications. Our dataset and model establish a strong foundation for explainable evaluation in generative video research, contributing to the development of multimodal generation and trustworthy AI. Code and dataset will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Dual-Student Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for model compression, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large teacher networks to compact student models. However, traditional knowledge distillation methods treat all teacher predictions equally, regardless of the teacher's confidence in those predictions. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware dual-student knowledge distillation framework that leverages teacher prediction uncertainty to selectively guide student learning. We introduce a peer-learning mechanism where two heterogeneous student architectures, specifically ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2, learn collaboratively from both the teacher network and each other. Experimental results on ImageNet-100 demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline knowledge distillation methods, with ResNet-18 achieving 83.84\% top-1 accuracy and MobileNetV2 achieving 81.46\% top-1 accuracy, representing improvements of 2.04\% and 0.92\% respectively over traditional single-student distillation approaches.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Metaheuristic Approaches to Improve Deep Learning Systems for Anxiety Disorder Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being among the most common psychological disorders, anxiety-related conditions are still primarily identified through subjective assessments, such as clinical interviews and self-evaluation questionnaires. These conventional methods often require significant time and may vary depending on the evaluator. However, the emergence of advanced artificial intelligence techniques has created new opportunities for detecting anxiety in a more consistent and automated manner. To address the limitations of traditional approaches, this study introduces a comprehensive model that integrates deep learning architectures with optimization strategies inspired by swarm intelligence. Using multimodal and wearable-sensor datasets, the framework analyzes physiological, emotional, and behavioral signals. Swarm intelligence techniques including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization are incorporated to refine the feature space and optimize hyperparameters. Meanwhile, deep learning components are tasked with deriving layered and discriminative representations from sequential, multi-source inputs. Our evaluation shows that the fusion of these two computational paradigms significantly enhances detection performance compared with using deep networks alone. The hybrid model achieves notable improvements in accuracy and demonstrates stronger generalization across various individuals. Overall, the results highlight the potential of combining metaheuristic optimization with deep learning to develop scalable, objective, and clinically meaningful solutions for assessing anxiety disorders</description>

      <title>VideoCompressa: Data-Efficient Video Understanding via Joint Temporal Compression and Spatial Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalability of video understanding models is increasingly limited by the prohibitive storage and computational costs of large-scale video datasets. While data synthesis has improved data efficiency in the image domain, its extension to video remains challenging due to pervasive temporal redundancy and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we uncover a critical insight: the primary source of inefficiency in video datasets is not inter-sample redundancy, but intra-sample frame-level redundancy. To leverage this insight, we introduce VideoCompressa, a novel framework for video data synthesis that reframes the problem as dynamic latent compression. Specifically, VideoCompressa jointly optimizes a differentiable keyframe selector-implemented as a lightweight ConvNet with Gumbel-Softmax sampling-to identify the most informative frames, and a pretrained, frozen Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress these frames into compact, semantically rich latent codes. These latent representations are then fed into a compression network, enabling end-to-end backpropagation. Crucially, the keyframe selector and synthetic latent codes are co-optimized to maximize retention of task-relevant information. Experiments show that our method achieves unprecedented data efficiency: on UCF101 with ConvNets, VideoCompressa surpasses full-data training by 2.34\% points using only 0.13\% of the original data, with over 5800x speedup compared to traditional synthesis method. Moreover, when fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B-VL on HMDB51, VideoCompressa matches full-data performance using just 0.41\% of the training data-outperforming zero-shot baseline by 10.61\%.</description>

      <title>FlowSteer: Guiding Few-Step Image Synthesis with Authentic Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the success of flow matching in visual generation, sampling efficiency remains a critical bottleneck for its practical application. Among flow models' accelerating methods, ReFlow has been somehow overlooked although it has theoretical consistency with flow matching. This is primarily due to its suboptimal performance in practical scenarios compared to consistency distillation and score distillation. In this work, we investigate this issue within the ReFlow framework and propose FlowSteer, a method unlocks the potential of ReFlow-based distillation by guiding the student along teacher's authentic generation trajectories. We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it. Then, we introduce a adversarial distillation objective applied directly on the ODE trajectory, improving the student's adherence to the teacher's generation trajectory. Furthermore, we find and fix a previously undiscovered flaw in the widely-used FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler that largely degrades few-step inference quality. Our experiment result on SD3 demonstrates our method's efficacy.</description>

      <title>FVAR: Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Next Focus Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual autoregressive models achieve remarkable generation quality through next-scale predictions across multi-scale token pyramids. However, the conventional method uses uniform scale downsampling to build these pyramids, leading to aliasing artifacts that compromise fine details and introduce unwanted jaggies and moir\'e patterns. To tackle this issue, we present \textbf{FVAR}, which reframes the paradigm from \emph{next-scale prediction} to \emph{next-focus prediction}, mimicking the natural process of camera focusing from blur to clarity. Our approach introduces three key innovations: \textbf{1) Next-Focus Prediction Paradigm} that transforms multi-scale autoregression by progressively reducing blur rather than simply downsampling; \textbf{2) Progressive Refocusing Pyramid Construction} that uses physics-consistent defocus kernels to build clean, alias-free multi-scale representations; and \textbf{3) High-Frequency Residual Learning} that employs a specialized residual teacher network to effectively incorporate alias information during training while maintaining deployment simplicity. Specifically, we construct optical low-pass views using defocus point spread function (PSF) kernels with decreasing radius, creating smooth blur-to-clarity transitions that eliminate aliasing at its source. To further enhance detail generation, we introduce a High-Frequency Residual Teacher that learns from both clean structure and alias residuals, distilling this knowledge to a vanilla VAR deployment network for seamless inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FVAR substantially reduces aliasing artifacts, improves fine detail preservation, and enhances text readability, achieving superior performance with perfect compatibility to existing VAR frameworks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multi-Label Thoracic Disease Diagnosis with Deep Ensemble-Based Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utility of deep learning models, such as CheXNet, in high stakes clinical settings is fundamentally constrained by their purely deterministic nature, failing to provide reliable measures of predictive confidence. This project addresses this critical gap by integrating robust Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into a high performance diagnostic platform for 14 common thoracic diseases on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset. Initial architectural development failed to stabilize performance and calibration using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), yielding an unacceptable Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.7588. This technical failure necessitated a rigorous architectural pivot to a high diversity, 9-member Deep Ensemble (DE). This resulting DE successfully stabilized performance and delivered superior reliability, achieving a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.8559 and an average F1 Score of 0.3857. Crucially, the DE demonstrated superior calibration (Mean ECE of 0.0728 and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of 0.1916) and enabled the reliable decomposition of total uncertainty into its Aleatoric (irreducible data noise) and Epistemic (reducible model knowledge) components, with a mean Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) of 0.0240. These results establish the Deep Ensemble as a trustworthy and explainable platform, transforming the model from a probabilistic tool into a reliable clinical decision support system.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Segmentation with Shared Feature Aggregation and Boundary-Focused Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) possesses the unique capability of preserving data confidentiality among clients while tackling the data heterogeneity problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely. We evaluate FedOAP on diverse tumor segmentation tasks spanning different organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods.</description>

      <title>Robust Long-term Test-Time Adaptation for 3D Human Pose Estimation through Motion Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online test-time adaptation addresses the train-test domain gap by adapting the model on unlabeled streaming test inputs before making the final prediction. However, online adaptation for 3D human pose estimation suffers from error accumulation when relying on self-supervision with imperfect predictions, leading to degraded performance over time. To mitigate this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel solution that highlights the use of motion discretization. Specifically, we employ unsupervised clustering in the latent motion representation space to derive a set of anchor motions, whose regularity aids in supervising the human pose estimator and enables efficient self-replay. Additionally, we introduce an effective and efficient soft-reset mechanism by reverting the pose estimator to its exponential moving average during continuous adaptation. We examine long-term online adaptation by continuously adapting to out-of-domain streaming test videos of the same individual, which allows for the capture of consistent personal shape and motion traits throughout the streaming observation. By mitigating error accumulation, our solution enables robust exploitation of these personal traits for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms previous online test-time adaptation methods and validate our design choices.</description>

      <title>Deep Hybrid Model for Region of Interest Detection in Omnidirectional Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of the project is to design a new model that predicts regions of interest in 360$^{\circ}$ videos. The region of interest (ROI) plays an important role in 360$^{\circ}$ video streaming. For example, ROIs are used to predict view-ports, intelligently cut the videos for live streaming, etc so that less bandwidth is used. Detecting view-ports in advance helps reduce the movement of the head while streaming and watching a video via the head-mounted device. Whereas, intelligent cuts of the videos help improve the efficiency of streaming the video to users and enhance the quality of their viewing experience. This report illustrates the secondary task to identify ROIs, in which, we design, train, and test a hybrid saliency model. In this work, we refer to saliency regions to represent the regions of interest. The method includes the processes as follows: preprocessing the video to obtain frames, developing a hybrid saliency model for predicting the region of interest, and finally post-processing the output predictions of the hybrid saliency model to obtain the output region of interest for each frame. Then, we compare the performance of the proposed method with the subjective annotations of the 360RAT dataset.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Long-tailed Dataset Distillation: A Uni-Level Framework with Unbiased Recovery and Relabeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation creates a small distilled set that enables efficient training by capturing key information from the full dataset. While existing dataset distillation methods perform well on balanced datasets, they struggle under long-tailed distributions, where imbalanced class frequencies induce biased model representations and corrupt statistical estimates such as Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. In this paper, we rethink long-tailed dataset distillation by revisiting the limitations of trajectory-based methods, and instead adopt the statistical alignment perspective to jointly mitigate model bias and restore fair supervision. To this end, we introduce three dedicated components that enable unbiased recovery of distilled images and soft relabeling: (1) enhancing expert models (an observer model for recovery and a teacher model for relabeling) to enable reliable statistics estimation and soft-label generation; (2) recalibrating BN statistics via a full forward pass with dynamically adjusted momentum to reduce representation skew; (3) initializing synthetic images by incrementally selecting high-confidence and diverse augmentations via a multi-round mechanism that promotes coverage and diversity. Extensive experiments on four long-tailed benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across varying degrees of class imbalance.Notably, our approach improves top-1 accuracy by 15.6% on CIFAR-100-LT and 11.8% on Tiny-ImageNet-LT under IPC=10 and IF=10.</description>

      <title>DualGazeNet: A Biologically Inspired Dual-Gaze Query Network for Salient Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) methods aim to improve performance in four key directions: semantic enhancement, boundary refinement, auxiliary task supervision, and multi-modal fusion. In pursuit of continuous gains, these approaches have evolved toward increasingly sophisticated architectures with multi-stage pipelines, specialized fusion modules, edge-guided learning, and elaborate attention mechanisms. However, this complexity paradoxically introduces feature redundancy and cross-component interference that obscure salient cues, ultimately reaching performance bottlenecks. In contrast, human vision achieves efficient salient object identification without such architectural complexity. This contrast raises a fundamental question: can we design a biologically grounded yet architecturally simple SOD framework that dispenses with most of this engineering complexity, while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability? In this work, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing DualGazeNet, a biologically inspired pure Transformer framework that models the dual biological principles of robust representation learning and magnocellular-parvocellular dual-pathway processing with cortical attention modulation in the human visual system. Extensive experiments on five RGB SOD benchmarks show that DualGazeNet consistently surpasses 25 state-of-the-art CNN- and Transformer-based methods. On average, DualGazeNet achieves about 60\% higher inference speed and 53.4\% fewer FLOPs than four Transformer-based baselines of similar capacity (VST++, MDSAM, Sam2unet, and BiRefNet). Moreover, DualGazeNet exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving leading or highly competitive performance on camouflaged and underwater SOD benchmarks without relying on additional modalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HunyuanVideo 1.5, a lightweight yet powerful open-source video generation model that achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and motion coherence with only 8.3 billion parameters, enabling efficient inference on consumer-grade GPUs. This achievement is built upon several key components, including meticulous data curation, an advanced DiT architecture featuring selective and sliding tile attention (SSTA), enhanced bilingual understanding through glyph-aware text encoding, progressive pre-training and post-training, and an efficient video super-resolution network. Leveraging these designs, we developed a unified framework capable of high-quality text-to-video and image-to-video generation across multiple durations and resolutions.Extensive experiments demonstrate that this compact and proficient model establishes a new state-of-the-art among open-source video generation models. By releasing the code and model weights, we provide the community with a high-performance foundation that lowers the barrier to video creation and research, making advanced video generation accessible to a broader audience.

      <title>Neural Texture Splatting: Expressive 3D Gaussian Splatting for View Synthesis, Geometry, and Dynamic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading approach for high-quality novel view synthesis, with numerous variants extending its applicability to a broad spectrum of 3D and 4D scene reconstruction tasks. Despite its success, the representational capacity of 3DGS remains limited by the use of 3D Gaussian kernels to model local variations. Recent works have proposed to augment 3DGS with additional per-primitive capacity, such as per-splat textures, to enhance its expressiveness. However, these per-splat texture approaches primarily target dense novel view synthesis with a reduced number of Gaussian primitives, and their effectiveness tends to diminish when applied to more general reconstruction scenarios. In this paper, we aim to achieve concrete performance improvement over state-of-the-art 3DGS variants across a wide range of reconstruction tasks, including novel view synthesis, geometry and dynamic reconstruction, under both sparse and dense input settings. To this end, we introduce Neural Texture Splatting (NTS). At the core of our approach is a global neural field (represented as a hybrid of a tri-plane and a neural decoder) that predicts local appearance and geometric fields for each primitive. By leveraging this shared global representation that models local texture fields across primitives, we significantly reduce model size and facilitate efficient global information exchange, demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Furthermore, our neural modeling of local texture fields introduces expressive view- and time-dependent effects, a critical aspect that existing methods fail to account for. Extensive experiments show that Neural Texture Splatting consistently improves models and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Parallel Vision Token Scheduling for Fast and Accurate Multimodal LMMs Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) deliver impressive vision-language reasoning but suffer steep inference latency because self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length and thousands of visual tokens contributed by high-resolution images. Naively pruning less-informative visual tokens reduces this burden, yet indiscriminate removal can strip away contextual cues essential for background or fine-grained questions, undermining accuracy. In this paper, we present ParVTS (Parallel Vision Token Scheduling), a training-free scheduling framework that partitions visual tokens into subject and non-subject groups, processes them in parallel to transfer their semantics into question tokens, and discards the non-subject path mid-inference to reduce computation. This scheduling reduces computational complexity, requires no heuristics or additional modules, and is compatible with diverse existing MLLM architectures. Experiments across multiple MLLM backbones show that ParVTS prunes up to 88.9% of visual tokens with minimal performance drop, achieving 1.77x speedup and 70% FLOPs reduction.</description>

      <title>Facade Segmentation for Solar Photovoltaic Suitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) facades represent a promising pathway towards urban decarbonization, especially where roof areas are insufficient and ground-mounted arrays are infeasible. Although machine learning-based approaches to support photovoltaic (PV) planning on rooftops are well researched, automated approaches for facades still remain scarce and oversimplified. This paper therefore presents a pipeline that integrates detailed information on the architectural composition of the facade to automatically identify suitable surfaces for PV application and estimate the solar energy potential. The pipeline fine-tunes SegFormer-B5 on the CMP Facades dataset and converts semantic predictions into facade-level PV suitability masks and PV panel layouts considering module sizes and clearances. Applied to a dataset of 373 facades with known dimensions from ten cities, the results show that installable BIPV potential is significantly lower than theoretical potential, thus providing valuable insights for reliable urban energy planning. With the growing availability of facade imagery, the proposed pipeline can be scaled to support BIPV planning in cities worldwide.</description>

      <title>MagicWorld: Interactive Geometry-driven Video World Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent interactive video world model methods generate scene evolution conditioned on user instructions. Although they achieve impressive results, two key limitations remain. First, they fail to fully exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and the underlying 3D geometry, which results in structural instability under viewpoint changes. Second, they easily forget historical information during multi-step interaction, resulting in error accumulation and progressive drift in scene semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose MagicWorld, an interactive video world model that integrates 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval. MagicWorld starts from a single scene image, employs user actions to drive dynamic scene evolution, and autoregressively synthesizes continuous scenes. We introduce the Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D), which constructs a point cloud from the first frame of each interaction and the corresponding action, providing explicit geometric constraints for viewpoint transitions and thereby improving structural consistency. We further propose History Cache Retrieval (HCR) mechanism, which retrieves relevant historical frames during generation and injects them as conditioning signals, helping the model utilize past scene information and mitigate error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations.</description>

      <title>MFmamba: A Multi-function Network for Panchromatic Image Resolution Restoration Based on State-Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing images are becoming increasingly widespread in military, earth resource exploration. Because of the limitation of a single sensor, we can obtain high spatial resolution grayscale panchromatic (PAN) images and low spatial resolution color multispectral (MS) images. Therefore, an important issue is to obtain a color image with high spatial resolution when there is only a PAN image at the input. The existing methods improve spatial resolution using super-resolution (SR) technology and spectral recovery using colorization technology. However, the SR technique cannot improve the spectral resolution, and the colorization technique cannot improve the spatial resolution. Moreover, the pansharpening method needs two registered inputs and can not achieve SR. As a result, an integrated approach is expected. To solve the above problems, we designed a novel multi-function model (MFmamba) to realize the tasks of SR, spectral recovery, joint SR and spectral recovery through three different inputs. Firstly, MFmamba utilizes UNet++ as the backbone, and a Mamba Upsample Block (MUB) is combined with UNet++. Secondly, a Dual Pool Attention (DPA) is designed to replace the skip connection in UNet++. Finally, a Multi-scale Hybrid Cross Block (MHCB) is proposed for initial feature extraction. Many experiments show that MFmamba is competitive in evaluation metrics and visual results and performs well in the three tasks when only the input PAN image is used.</description>

      <title>MetaDCSeg: Robust Medical Image Segmentation via Meta Dynamic Center Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which lead to instability in model training. Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an effective and lightweight framework for post-training visual generative models. However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.</description>

      <title>EventSTU: Event-Guided Efficient Spatio-Temporal Understanding for Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video large language models have demonstrated strong video understanding capabilities but suffer from high inference costs due to the massive number of tokens in long videos. Inspired by event-based vision, we propose an event-guided, training-free framework for efficient spatio-temporal understanding, named EventSTU. In the temporal domain, we design a coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling algorithm that exploits the change-triggered property of event cameras to eliminate redundant frames. In the spatial domain, we design an adaptive token pruning algorithm that leverages the visual saliency of events as a zero-cost prior to guide spatial reduction. From a holistic spatio-temporal perspective, we further integrate question relevance from keyframe sampling to adaptively allocate token pruning budgets. To facilitate evaluation, we construct EventBench, the first event-inclusive, human-annotated multimodal benchmark that covers diverse real-world scenarios. Beyond physical event cameras, EventSTU also supports general video understanding using simulated events. Comprehensive experiments show that EventSTU achieves 3.01x FLOPs reduction and 3.10x prefilling speedup over the strongest baseline while still improving performance.</description>

      <title>BackdoorVLM: A Benchmark for Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems by injecting hidden behaviors that can be maliciously activated at inference time. While such threats have been extensively studied in unimodal settings, their impact on multimodal foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{BackdoorVLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating backdoor attacks on VLMs across a broad range of settings. It adopts a unified perspective that injects and analyzes backdoors across core vision-language tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering. BackdoorVLM organizes multimodal backdoor threats into 5 representative categories: targeted refusal, malicious injection, jailbreak, concept substitution, and perceptual hijack. Each category captures a distinct pathway through which an adversary can manipulate a model's behavior. We evaluate these threats using 12 representative attack methods spanning text, image, and bimodal triggers, tested on 2 open-source VLMs and 3 multimodal datasets. Our analysis reveals that VLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to textual instructions, and in bimodal backdoors the text trigger typically overwhelms the image trigger when forming the backdoor mapping. Notably, backdoors involving the textual modality remain highly potent, with poisoning rates as low as 1\% yielding over 90\% success across most tasks. These findings highlight significant, previously underexplored vulnerabilities in current VLMs. We hope that BackdoorVLM can serve as a useful benchmark for analyzing and mitigating multimodal backdoor threats.

      <title>One4D: Unified 4D Generation and Reconstruction via Decoupled LoRA Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present One4D, a unified framework for 4D generation and reconstruction that produces dynamic 4D content as synchronized RGB frames and pointmaps. By consistently handling varying sparsities of conditioning frames through a Unified Masked Conditioning (UMC) mechanism, One4D can seamlessly transition between 4D generation from a single image, 4D reconstruction from a full video, and mixed generation and reconstruction from sparse frames. Our framework adapts a powerful video generation model for joint RGB and pointmap generation, with carefully designed network architectures. The commonly used diffusion finetuning strategies for depthmap or pointmap reconstruction often fail on joint RGB and pointmap generation, quickly degrading the base video model. To address this challenge, we introduce Decoupled LoRA Control (DLC), which employs two modality-specific LoRA adapters to form decoupled computation branches for RGB frames and pointmaps, connected by lightweight, zero-initialized control links that gradually learn mutual pixel-level consistency. Trained on a mixture of synthetic and real 4D datasets under modest computational budgets, One4D produces high-quality RGB frames and accurate pointmaps across both generation and reconstruction tasks. This work represents a step toward general, high-quality geometry-based 4D world modeling using video diffusion models. Project page: https://mizhenxing.github.io/One4D</description>

      <title>AttenDence: Maximizing Attention Confidence for Test Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables models to adapt to distribution shifts at inference time. While entropy minimization over the output distribution has proven effective for TTA, transformers offer an additional unsupervised learning signal through their attention mechanisms. We propose minimizing the entropy of attention distributions from the CLS token to image patches as a novel TTA objective.This approach encourages the model to attend more confidently to relevant image regions under distribution shift and is effective even when only a single test image is available. We demonstrate that attention entropy minimization improves robustness across diverse corruption types while not hurting performance on clean data on a single sample stream of images at test time.</description>

      <title>FineXtrol: Controllable Motion Generation via Fine-Grained Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have sought to enhance the controllability and precision of text-driven motion generation. Some approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to produce more detailed texts, while others incorporate global 3D coordinate sequences as additional control signals. However, the former often introduces misaligned details and lacks explicit temporal cues, and the latter incurs significant computational cost when converting coordinates to standard motion representations. To address these issues, we propose FineXtrol, a novel control framework for efficient motion generation guided by temporally-aware, precise, user-friendly, and fine-grained textual control signals that describe specific body part movements over time. In support of this framework, we design a hierarchical contrastive learning module that encourages the text encoder to produce more discriminative embeddings for our novel control signals, thereby improving motion controllability. Quantitative results show that FineXtrol achieves strong performance in controllable motion generation, while qualitative analysis demonstrates its flexibility in directing specific body part movements.</description>

      <title>Human-Centric Open-Future Task Discovery: Formulation, Benchmark, and Scalable Tree-Based Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in robotics and embodied AI is largely driven by Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, a key challenge remains underexplored: how can we advance LMMs to discover tasks that directly assist humans in open-future scenarios, where human intentions are highly concurrent and dynamic. In this work, we formalize the problem of Human-centric Open-future Task Discovery (HOTD), focusing particularly on identifying tasks that reduce human effort across multiple plausible futures. To facilitate this study, we propose an HOTD-Bench, which features over 2K real-world videos, a semi-automated annotation pipeline, and a simulation-based protocol tailored for open-set future evaluation. Additionally, we propose the Collaborative Multi-Agent Search Tree (CMAST) framework, which decomposes the complex reasoning through a multi-agent system and structures the reasoning process through a scalable search tree module. In our experiments, CMAST achieves the best performance on the HOTD-Bench, significantly surpassing existing LMMs. It also integrates well with existing LMMs, consistently improving performance.</description>

      <title>VeCoR - Velocity Contrastive Regularization for Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has recently emerged as a principled and efficient alternative to diffusion models. Standard FM encourages the learned velocity field to follow a target direction; however, it may accumulate errors along the trajectory and drive samples off the data manifold, leading to perceptual degradation, especially in lightweight or low-step configurations.
  To enhance stability and generalization, we extend FM into a balanced attract-repel scheme that provides explicit guidance on both "where to go" and "where not to go." To be formal, we propose \textbf{Velocity Contrastive Regularization (VeCoR)}, a complementary training scheme for flow-based generative modeling that augments the standard FM objective with contrastive, two-sided supervision. VeCoR not only aligns the predicted velocity with a stable reference direction (positive supervision) but also pushes it away from inconsistent, off-manifold directions (negative supervision). This contrastive formulation transforms FM from a purely attractive, one-sided objective into a two-sided training signal, regularizing trajectory evolution and improving perceptual fidelity across datasets and backbones.
  On ImageNet-1K 256$\times$256, VeCoR yields 22\% and 35\% relative FID reductions on SiT-XL/2 and REPA-SiT-XL/2 backbones, respectively, and achieves further FID gains (32\% relative) on MS-COCO text-to-image generation, demonstrating consistent improvements in stability, convergence, and image quality, particularly in low-step and lightweight settings.

      <title>Leveraging Adversarial Learning for Pathological Fidelity in Virtual Staining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to evaluating tumor morphology using H&amp;E staining, immunohistochemistry is used to assess the presence of specific proteins within the tissue. However, this is a costly and labor-intensive technique, for which virtual staining, as an image-to-image translation task, offers a promising alternative. Although recent, this is an emerging field of research with 64% of published studies just in 2024. Most studies use publicly available datasets of H&amp;E-IHC pairs from consecutive tissue sections. Recognizing the training challenges, many authors develop complex virtual staining models based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, but ignore the impact of adversarial loss on the quality of virtual staining. Furthermore, overlooking the issues of model evaluation, they claim improved performance based on metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, which are not sufficiently robust to evaluate the quality of virtually stained images. In this paper, we developed CSSP2P GAN, which we demonstrate to achieve heightened pathological fidelity through a blind pathological expert evaluation. Furthermore, while iteratively developing our model, we study the impact of the adversarial loss and demonstrate its crucial role in the quality of virtually stained images. Finally, while comparing our model with reference works in the field, we underscore the limitations of the currently used evaluation metrics and demonstrate the superior performance of CSSP2P GAN.</description>

      <title>Eevee: Towards Close-up High-resolution Video-based Virtual Try-on</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video virtual try-on technology provides a cost-effective solution for creating marketing videos in fashion e-commerce. However, its practical adoption is hindered by two critical limitations. First, the reliance on a single garment image as input in current virtual try-on datasets limits the accurate capture of realistic texture details. Second, most existing methods focus solely on generating full-shot virtual try-on videos, neglecting the business's demand for videos that also provide detailed close-ups. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-resolution dataset for video-based virtual try-on. This dataset offers two key features. First, it provides more detailed information on the garments, which includes high-fidelity images with detailed close-ups and textual descriptions; Second, it uniquely includes full-shot and close-up try-on videos of real human models. Furthermore, accurately assessing consistency becomes significantly more critical for the close-up videos, which demand high-fidelity preservation of garment details. To facilitate such fine-grained evaluation, we propose a new garment consistency metric VGID (Video Garment Inception Distance) that quantifies the preservation of both texture and structure. Our experiments validate these contributions. We demonstrate that by utilizing the detailed images from our dataset, existing video generation models can extract and incorporate texture features, significantly enhancing the realism and detail fidelity of virtual try-on results. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of recent models. The benchmark effectively identifies the texture and structural preservation problems among current methods.</description>

      <title>CataractCompDetect: Intraoperative Complication Detection in Cataract Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgeries worldwide, yet intraoperative complications such as iris prolapse, posterior capsule rupture (PCR), and vitreous loss remain major causes of adverse outcomes. Automated detection of such events could enable early warning systems and objective training feedback. In this work, we propose CataractCompDetect, a complication detection framework that combines phase-aware localization, SAM 2-based tracking, complication-specific risk scoring, and vision-language reasoning for final classification. To validate CataractCompDetect, we curate CataComp, the first cataract surgery video dataset annotated for intraoperative complications, comprising 53 surgeries, including 23 with clinical complications. On CataComp, CataractCompDetect achieves an average F1 score of 70.63%, with per-complication performance of 81.8% (Iris Prolapse), 60.87% (PCR), and 69.23% (Vitreous Loss). These results highlight the value of combining structured surgical priors with vision-language reasoning for recognizing rare but high-impact intraoperative events. Our dataset and code will be publicly released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Peregrine: One-Shot Fine-Tuning for FHE Inference of General Deep CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address two fundamental challenges in adapting general deep CNNs for FHE-based inference: approximating non-linear activations such as ReLU with low-degree polynomials while minimizing accuracy degradation, and overcoming the ciphertext capacity barrier that constrains high-resolution image processing on FHE inference. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a single-stage fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that directly converts pre-trained CNNs into FHE-friendly forms using low-degree polynomials, achieving competitive accuracy with minimal training overhead; and (2) a generalized interleaved packing (GIP) scheme that is compatible with feature maps of virtually arbitrary spatial resolutions, accompanied by a suite of carefully designed homomorphic operators that preserve the GIP-form encryption throughout computation. These advances enable efficient, end-to-end FHE inference across diverse CNN architectures. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MS COCO demonstrate that the FHE-friendly CNNs obtained via our SFT strategy achieve accuracy comparable to baselines using ReLU or SiLU activations. Moreover, this work presents the first demonstration of FHE-based inference for YOLO architectures in object detection leveraging low-degree polynomial activations.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot segmentation of skin tumors in whole-slide images with vision-language foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate annotation of cutaneous neoplasm biopsies represents a major challenge due to their wide morphological variability, overlapping histological patterns, and the subtle distinctions between benign and malignant lesions. Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), pre-trained on paired image-text corpora, learn joint representations that bridge visual features and diagnostic terminology, enabling zero-shot localization and classification of tissue regions without pixel-level labels. However, most existing VLM applications in histopathology remain limited to slide-level tasks or rely on coarse interactive prompts, and they struggle to produce fine-grained segmentations across gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this work, we introduce a zero-shot visual-language segmentation pipeline for whole-slide images (ZEUS), a fully automated, zero-shot segmentation framework that leverages class-specific textual prompt ensembles and frozen VLM encoders to generate high-resolution tumor masks in WSIs. By partitioning each WSI into overlapping patches, extracting visual embeddings, and computing cosine similarities against text prompts, we generate a final segmentation mask. We demonstrate competitive performance on two in-house datasets, primary spindle cell neoplasms and cutaneous metastases, highlighting the influence of prompt design, domain shifts, and institutional variability in VLMs for histopathology. ZEUS markedly reduces annotation burden while offering scalable, explainable tumor delineation for downstream diagnostic workflows.</description>

      <title>UMCL: Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning for Cross-compression-rate Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In deepfake detection, the varying degrees of compression employed by social media platforms pose significant challenges for model generalization and reliability. Although existing methods have progressed from single-modal to multimodal approaches, they face critical limitations: single-modal methods struggle with feature degradation under data compression in social media streaming, while multimodal approaches require expensive data collection and labeling and suffer from inconsistent modal quality or accessibility in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework for robust cross-compression-rate (CCR) deepfake detection. In the training stage, our approach transforms a single visual modality into three complementary features: compression-robust rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, and semantic embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models. These features are explicitly aligned through an affinity-driven semantic alignment (ASA) strategy, which models inter-modal relationships through affinity matrices and optimizes their consistency through contrastive learning. Subsequently, our cross-quality similarity learning (CQSL) strategy enhances feature robustness across compression rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across various compression rates and manipulation types, establishing a new benchmark for robust deepfake detection. Notably, our approach maintains high detection accuracy even when individual features degrade, while providing interpretable insights into feature relationships through explicit alignment.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Plant Disease Diagnosis: Bridging the Academic-Practical Gap with Vision Transformers and Zero-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in plant disease classification using leaf images. Much of the existing research in this field has relied on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of well-centered plant images captured against uniform, uncluttered backgrounds. Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features. Most notably, CLIP models classify diseases directly from natural language descriptions without any task-specific training, offering strong adaptability and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of zero-shot learning as a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments.</description>

      <title>View-Consistent Diffusion Representations for 3D-Consistent Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models have made significant progress in generating realistic content, enabling applications in simulation, gaming, and film making. However, current generated videos still contain visual artifacts arising from 3D inconsistencies, e.g., objects and structures deforming under changes in camera pose, which can undermine user experience and simulation fidelity. Motivated by recent findings on representation alignment for diffusion models, we hypothesize that improving the multi-view consistency of video diffusion representations will yield more 3D-consistent video generation. Through detailed analysis on multiple recent camera-controlled video diffusion models we reveal strong correlations between 3D-consistent representations and videos. We also propose ViCoDR, a new approach for improving the 3D consistency of video models by learning multi-view consistent diffusion representations. We evaluate ViCoDR on camera controlled image-to-video, text-to-video, and multi-view generation models, demonstrating significant improvements in the 3D consistency of the generated videos.

      <title>AuViRe: Audio-visual Speech Representation Reconstruction for Deepfake Temporal Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of sophisticated synthetic audio-visual content, e.g., for subtle malicious manipulations, ensuring the integrity of digital media has become paramount. This work presents a novel approach to temporal localization of deepfakes by leveraging Audio-Visual Speech Representation Reconstruction (AuViRe). Specifically, our approach reconstructs speech representations from one modality (e.g., lip movements) based on the other (e.g., audio waveform). Cross-modal reconstruction is significantly more challenging in manipulated video segments, leading to amplified discrepancies, thereby providing robust discriminative cues for precise temporal forgery localization. AuViRe outperforms the state of the art by +8.9 AP@0.95 on LAV-DF, +9.6 AP@0.5 on AV-Deepfake1M, and +5.1 AUC on an in-the-wild experiment.

      <title>A Self-Conditioned Representation Guided Diffusion Model for Realistic Text-to-LiDAR Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-LiDAR generation can customize 3D data with rich structures and diverse scenes for downstream tasks. However, the scarcity of Text-LiDAR pairs often causes insufficient training priors, generating overly smooth 3D scenes. Moreover, low-quality text descriptions may degrade generation quality and controllability. In this paper, we propose a Text-to-LiDAR Diffusion Model for scene generation, named T2LDM, with a Self-Conditioned Representation Guidance (SCRG). Specifically, SCRG, by aligning to the real representations, provides the soft supervision with reconstruction details for the Denoising Network (DN) in training, while decoupled in inference. In this way, T2LDM can perceive rich geometric structures from data distribution, generating detailed objects in scenes. Meanwhile, we construct a content-composable Text-LiDAR benchmark, T2nuScenes, along with a controllability metric. Based on this, we analyze the effects of different text prompts for LiDAR generation quality and controllability, providing practical prompt paradigms and insights. Furthermore, a directional position prior is designed to mitigate street distortion, further improving scene fidelity. Additionally, by learning a conditional encoder via frozen DN, T2LDM can support multiple conditional tasks, including Sparse-to-Dense, Dense-to-Sparse, and Semantic-to-LiDAR generation. Extensive experiments in unconditional and conditional generation demonstrate that T2LDM outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Granularity Matters: Rethinking Vision Transformers Beyond Fixed Patch Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing global dependencies but often struggle to efficiently represent fine-grained local details. Existing multi-scale approaches alleviate this issue by integrating hierarchical or hybrid features; however, they rely on fixed patch sizes and introduce redundant computation. To address these limitations, we propose Granularity-driven Vision Transformer (Grc-ViT), a dynamic coarse-to-fine framework that adaptively adjusts visual granularity based on image complexity. It comprises two key stages: (1) Coarse Granularity Evaluation module, which assesses visual complexity using edge density, entropy, and frequency-domain cues to estimate suitable patch and window sizes; (2) Fine-grained Refinement module, which refines attention computation according to the selected granularity, enabling efficient and precise feature learning. Two learnable parameters, {\alpha} and \b{eta}, are optimized end-to-end to balance global reasoning and local perception. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Grc-ViT enhances fine-grained discrimination while achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Life-IQA: Boosting Blind Image Quality Assessment through GCN-enhanced Layer Interaction and MoE-based Feature Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) plays a crucial role in evaluating and optimizing visual experience. Most existing BIQA approaches fuse shallow and deep features extracted from backbone networks, while overlooking the unequal contributions to quality prediction. Moreover, while various vision encoder backbones are widely adopted in BIQA, the effective quality decoding architectures remain underexplored. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the contributions of shallow and deep features to BIQA, and proposes a effective quality feature decoding framework via GCN-enhanced \underline{l}ayer\underline{i}nteraction and MoE-based \underline{f}eature d\underline{e}coupling, termed \textbf{(Life-IQA)}. Specifically, the GCN-enhanced layer interaction module utilizes the GCN-enhanced deepest-layer features as query and the penultimate-layer features as key, value, then performs cross-attention to achieve feature interaction. Moreover, a MoE-based feature decoupling module is proposed to decouple fused representations though different experts specialized for specific distortion types or quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Life-IQA shows more favorable balance between accuracy and cost than a vanilla Transformer decoder and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA benchmarks.The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/TANGLONG2/Life-IQA/tree/main}{\texttt{Life-IQA}}.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Corruption Robustness of LVLMs: A Discriminative Benchmark and Robustness Alignment Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable reasoning abilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), their robustness under visual corruptions remains insufficiently studied. Existing evaluation paradigms exhibit two major limitations: 1) the dominance of low-discriminative samples in current datasets masks the real robustness gap between models; and 2) conventional accuracy-based metric fail to capture the degradation of the underlying prediction structure. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Bench-C, a comprehensive benchmark emphasizing discriminative samples for assessing corruption robustness, where a selection strategy is proposed to jointly consider the prediction inconsistency under corruption and the semantic diversity. Furthermore, we propose the Robustness Alignment Score (RAS), a unified metric that measures degradation in logit-level prediction structure by considering the shifts in prediction uncertainty and calibration alignment. Comprehensive experiments and analysis reveal several interesting findings: 1) model behaviors exhibit distinguish patterns under corruptions, such as erroneous confidence and hesitation; 2) despite subtle corruption may lead to a slight accuracy gain, the overall prediction structure still degrades; 3) by decomposing corruption robustness into destructive and corrective components, the distinct failure and recovery patterns across models can be revealed.</description>

      <title>ReEXplore: Improving MLLMs for Embodied Exploration with Contextualized Retrospective Experience Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied exploration is a target-driven process that requires embodied agents to possess fine-grained perception and knowledge-enhanced decision making. While recent attempts leverage MLLMs for exploration due to their strong perceptual and reasoning abilities, we find that MLLM-based embodied agents remain suboptimal in exploring new environments: (i) they rely on profound but stale pre-trained knowledge, (ii) training-based approaches such as imitation learning or reinforcement learning are expensive for long-horizon tasks with sparse outcome rewards, and (iii) frontier-based exploration yields a large, visually nuanced action space that is difficult for MLLMs to make reliable decisions. We address these challenges with ReEXplore, a training-free framework that performs retrospective experience replay to inject distilled, abstract experience at inference time, and hierarchical frontier selection to decompose frontier ranking into coarse-to-fine decisions. Our approach enables robust, traceable, and efficient exploration. Across multiple embodied exploration benchmarks, ReEXplore yields great improvements over strong MLLM baselines, up to 3x higher performance in both success rate and in navigation efficiency under open-source backbones.</description>

      <title>CSD: Change Semantic Detection with only Semantic Change Masks for Damage Assessment in Conflict Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately and swiftly assessing damage from conflicts is crucial for humanitarian aid and regional stability. In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the CSD task, and its outstanding performance paves the way for practical applications in rapid damage assessment across conflict zones.</description>

      <title>MedSAM3: Delving into Segment Anything with Medical Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental for biomedical discovery. Existing methods lack generalizability and demand extensive, time-consuming manual annotation for new clinical application. Here, we propose MedSAM-3, a text promptable medical segmentation model for medical image and video segmentation. By fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3 architecture on medical images paired with semantic conceptual labels, our MedSAM-3 enables medical Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS), allowing precise targeting of anatomical structures via open-vocabulary text descriptions rather than solely geometric prompts. We further introduce the MedSAM-3 Agent, a framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform complex reasoning and iterative refinement in an agent-in-the-loop workflow. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging modalities, including X-ray, MRI, Ultrasound, CT, and video, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing specialist and foundation models. We will release our code and model at https://github.com/Joey-S-Liu/MedSAM3.</description>

      <title>Beyond Reward Margin: Rethinking and Resolving Likelihood Displacement in Diffusion Models via Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promising results in aligning generative outputs with human preferences by distinguishing between chosen and rejected samples. However, a critical limitation of DPO is likelihood displacement, where the probabilities of chosen samples paradoxically decrease during training, undermining the quality of generation. Although this issue has been investigated in autoregressive models, its impact within diffusion-based models remains largely unexplored. This gap leads to suboptimal performance in tasks involving video generation. To address this, we conduct a formal analysis of DPO loss through updating policy within the diffusion framework, which describes how the updating of specific training samples influences the model's predictions on other samples. Using this tool, we identify two main failure modes: (1) Optimization Conflict, which arises from small reward margins between chosen and rejected samples, and (2) Suboptimal Maximization, caused by large reward margins. Informed by these insights, we introduce a novel solution named Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO), combining Adaptive Rejection Scaling (ARS) and Implicit Preference Regularization (IPR) to effectively mitigate likelihood displacement. Experiments show that PG-DPO outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, offering a robust solution for improving preference alignment in video generation tasks.</description>

      <title>LAA3D: A Benchmark of Detecting and Tracking Low-Altitude Aircraft in 3D Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception of Low-Altitude Aircraft (LAA) in 3D space enables precise 3D object localization and behavior understanding. However, datasets tailored for 3D LAA perception remain scarce. To address this gap, we present LAA3D, a large-scale dataset designed to advance 3D detection and tracking of low-altitude aerial vehicles. LAA3D contains 15,000 real images and 600,000 synthetic frames, captured across diverse scenarios, including urban and suburban environments. It covers multiple aerial object categories, including electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), and Helicopters. Each instance is annotated with 3D bounding box, class label, and instance identity, supporting tasks such as 3D object detection, 3D multi-object tracking (MOT), and 6-DoF pose estimation. Besides, we establish the LAA3D Benchmark, integrating multiple tasks and methods with unified evaluation protocols for comparison. Furthermore, we propose MonoLAA, a monocular 3D detection baseline, achieving robust 3D localization from zoom cameras with varying focal lengths. Models pretrained on synthetic images transfer effectively to real-world data with fine-tuning, demonstrating strong sim-to-real generalization. Our LAA3D provides a comprehensive foundation for future research in low-altitude 3D object perception.</description>

      <title>Granular Computing-driven SAM: From Coarse-to-Fine Guidance for Prompt-Free Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt-free image segmentation aims to generate accurate masks without manual guidance. Typical pre-trained models, notably Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), generate prompts directly at a single granularity level. However, this approach has two limitations: (1) Localizability, lacking mechanisms for autonomous region localization; (2) Scalability, limited fine-grained modeling at high resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce Granular Computing-driven SAM (Grc-SAM), a coarse-to-fine framework motivated by Granular Computing (GrC). First, the coarse stage adaptively extracts high-response regions from features to achieve precise foreground localization and reduce reliance on external prompts. Second, the fine stage applies finer patch partitioning with sparse local swin-style attention to enhance detail modeling and enable high-resolution segmentation. Third, refined masks are encoded as latent prompt embeddings for the SAM decoder, replacing handcrafted prompts with an automated reasoning process. By integrating multi-granularity attention, Grc-SAM bridges granular computing with vision transformers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Grc-SAM outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and scalability. It offers a unique granular computational perspective for prompt-free segmentation.</description>

      <title>Understanding, Accelerating, and Improving MeanFlow Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MeanFlow promises high-quality generative modeling in few steps, by jointly learning instantaneous and average velocity fields. Yet, the underlying training dynamics remain unclear. We analyze the interaction between the two velocities and find: (i) well-established instantaneous velocity is a prerequisite for learning average velocity; (ii) learning of instantaneous velocity benefits from average velocity when the temporal gap is small, but degrades as the gap increases; and (iii) task-affinity analysis indicates that smooth learning of large-gap average velocities, essential for one-step generation, depends on the prior formation of accurate instantaneous and small-gap average velocities. Guided by these observations, we design an effective training scheme that accelerates the formation of instantaneous velocity, then shifts emphasis from short- to long-interval average velocity. Our enhanced MeanFlow training yields faster convergence and significantly better few-step generation: With the same DiT-XL backbone, our method reaches an impressive FID of 2.87 on 1-NFE ImageNet 256x256, compared to 3.43 for the conventional MeanFlow baseline. Alternatively, our method matches the performance of the MeanFlow baseline with 2.5x shorter training time, or with a smaller DiT-L backbone.</description>

      <title>DynaMix: Generalizable Person Re-identification via Dynamic Relabeling and Mixed Data Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizable person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across unseen cameras and environments. While existing methods rely heavily on limited labeled multi-camera data, we propose DynaMix, a novel method that effectively combines manually labeled multi-camera and large-scale pseudo-labeled single-camera data. Unlike prior works, DynaMix dynamically adapts to the structure and noise of the training data through three core components: (1) a Relabeling Module that refines pseudo-labels of single-camera identities on-the-fly; (2) an Efficient Centroids Module that maintains robust identity representations under a large identity space; and (3) a Data Sampling Module that carefully composes mixed data mini-batches to balance learning complexity and intra-batch diversity. All components are specifically designed to operate efficiently at scale, enabling effective training on millions of images and hundreds of thousands of identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID.</description>

      <title>DEAP-3DSAM: Decoder Enhanced and Auto Prompt SAM for 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently demonstrated significant potential in medical image segmentation. Although SAM is primarily trained on 2D images, attempts have been made to apply it to 3D medical image segmentation. However, the pseudo 3D processing used to adapt SAM results in spatial feature loss, limiting its performance. Additionally, most SAM-based methods still rely on manual prompts, which are challenging to implement in real-world scenarios and require extensive external expert knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce the Decoder Enhanced and Auto Prompt SAM (DEAP-3DSAM) to tackle these limitations. Specifically, we propose a Feature Enhanced Decoder that fuses the original image features with rich and detailed spatial information to enhance spatial features. We also design a Dual Attention Prompter to automatically obtain prompt information through Spatial Attention and Channel Attention. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four public abdominal tumor segmentation datasets. The results indicate that our DEAP-3DSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D image segmentation, outperforming or matching existing manual prompt methods. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</description>

      <title>Graph-based 3D Human Pose Estimation using WiFi Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation (HPE) has attracted increasing attention due to its resilience to occlusion and privacy-preserving compared to camera-based methods. However, existing WiFi-based HPE approaches often employ regression networks that directly map WiFi channel state information (CSI) to 3D joint coordinates, ignoring the inherent topological relationships among human joints. In this paper, we present GraphPose-Fi, a graph-based framework that explicitly models skeletal topology for WiFi-based 3D HPE. Our framework comprises a CNN encoder shared across antennas for subcarrier-time feature extraction, a lightweight attention module that adaptively reweights features over time and across antennas, and a graph-based regression head that combines GCN layers with self-attention to capture local topology and global dependencies. Our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on the MM-Fi dataset in various settings. The source code is available at: https://github.com/Cirrick/GraphPose-Fi.</description>

      <title>HABIT: Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic in CARLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current autonomous driving (AD) simulations are critically limited by their inadequate representation of realistic and diverse human behavior, which is essential for ensuring safety and reliability. Existing benchmarks often simplify pedestrian interactions, failing to capture complex, dynamic intentions and varied responses critical for robust system deployment. To overcome this, we introduce HABIT (Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic), a high-fidelity simulation benchmark. HABIT integrates real-world human motion, sourced from mocap and videos, into CARLA (Car Learning to Act, a full autonomous driving simulator) via a modular, extensible, and physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline. From an initial pool of approximately 30,000 retargeted motions, we curate 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions, standardized in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories. HABIT seamlessly integrates with CARLA's Leaderboard, enabling automated scenario generation and rigorous agent evaluation. Our safety metrics, including Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and False Positive Braking Rate (FPBR), reveal critical failure modes in state-of-the-art AD agents missed by prior evaluations. Evaluating three state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents, InterFuser, TransFuser, and BEVDriver, demonstrates how HABIT exposes planner weaknesses that remain hidden in scripted simulations. Despite achieving close or equal to zero collisions per kilometer on the CARLA Leaderboard, the autonomous agents perform notably worse on HABIT, with up to 7.43 collisions/km and a 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and they brake unnecessarily in up to 33% of cases. All components are publicly released to support reproducible, pedestrian-aware AI research.</description>

      <title>DiffSeg30k: A Multi-Turn Diffusion Editing Benchmark for Localized AIGC Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based editing enables realistic modification of local image regions, making AI-generated content harder to detect. Existing AIGC detection benchmarks focus on classifying entire images, overlooking the localization of diffusion-based edits. We introduce DiffSeg30k, a publicly available dataset of 30k diffusion-edited images with pixel-level annotations, designed to support fine-grained detection. DiffSeg30k features: 1) In-the-wild images--we collect images or image prompts from COCO to reflect real-world content diversity; 2) Diverse diffusion models--local edits using eight SOTA diffusion models; 3) Multi-turn editing--each image undergoes up to three sequential edits to mimic real-world sequential editing; and 4) Realistic editing scenarios--a vision-language model (VLM)-based pipeline automatically identifies meaningful regions and generates context-aware prompts covering additions, removals, and attribute changes. DiffSeg30k shifts AIGC detection from binary classification to semantic segmentation, enabling simultaneous localization of edits and identification of the editing models. We benchmark three baseline segmentation approaches, revealing significant challenges in semantic segmentation tasks, particularly concerning robustness to image distortions. Experiments also reveal that segmentation models, despite being trained for pixel-level localization, emerge as highly reliable whole-image classifiers of diffusion edits, outperforming established forgery classifiers while showing great potential in cross-generator generalization. We believe DiffSeg30k will advance research in fine-grained localization of AI-generated content by demonstrating the promise and limitations of segmentation-based methods. DiffSeg30k is released at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Chaos2629/Diffseg30k</description>

      <title>3M-TI: High-Quality Mobile Thermal Imaging via Calibration-free Multi-Camera Cross-Modal Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniaturization of thermal sensors for mobile platforms inherently limits their spatial resolution and textural fidelity, leading to blurry and less informative images. Existing thermal super-resolution (SR) methods can be grouped into single-image and RGB-guided approaches: the former struggles to recover fine structures from limited information, while the latter relies on accurate and laborious cross-camera calibration, which hinders practical deployment and robustness. Here, we propose 3M-TI, a calibration-free Multi-camera cross-Modality diffusion framework for Mobile Thermal Imaging. At its core, 3M-TI integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into the diffusion UNet, replacing the original self-attention layers to adaptively align thermal and RGB features throughout the denoising process, without requiring explicit camera calibration. This design enables the diffusion network to leverage its generative prior to enhance spatial resolution, structural fidelity, and texture detail in the super-resolved thermal images. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks validate our superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. More importantly, the thermal images enhanced by 3M-TI lead to substantial gains in critical downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, underscoring its practical value for robust mobile thermal perception systems.

      <title>MonoSR: Open-Vocabulary Spatial Reasoning from Monocular Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning (SR), the ability to infer 3D spatial information from 2D inputs, is essential for real-world applications such as embodied AI and autonomous driving. However, existing research primarily focuses on indoor environments and typically relies on multi-view observations, which limits their generalizability to outdoor scenarios and constrains their applicability to monocular images, the most common real-world setting. In this work, we propose MonoSR, a large-scale monocular spatial reasoning dataset that spans diverse scenarios including indoor, outdoor, and object-centric settings, and supports multiple question types. MonoSR provides a path toward open-world monocular spatial reasoning. Beyond introducing the dataset, we evaluate advanced vision-language models to reveal their limitations on this challenging task. We further analyze whether auxiliary information is crucial for monocular spatial reasoning and offer practical guidance for designing future models. These contributions collectively establish a foundation for advancing monocular spatial reasoning in real-world, open-world environments.</description>

      <title>When Semantics Regulate: Rethinking Patch Shuffle and Internal Bias for Generated Image Detection with CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of GANs and Diffusion Models poses new challenges for detecting AI-generated images. Although CLIP-based detectors exhibit promising generalization, they often rely on semantic cues rather than generator artifacts, leading to brittle performance under distribution shifts. In this work, we revisit the nature of semantic bias and uncover that Patch Shuffle provides an unusually strong benefit for CLIP, that disrupts global semantic continuity while preserving local artifact cues, which reduces semantic entropy and homogenizes feature distributions between natural and synthetic images. Through a detailed layer-wise analysis, we further show that CLIP's deep semantic structure functions as a regulator that stabilizes cross-domain representations once semantic bias is suppressed. Guided by these findings, we propose SemAnti, a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning paradigm that freezes the semantic subspace and adapts only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics. Despite its simplicity, SemAnti achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization on AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage, demonstrating that regulating semantics is key to unlocking CLIP's full potential for robust AI-generated image detection.</description>

      <title>MambaRefine-YOLO: A Dual-Modality Small Object Detector for UAV Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery is a persistent challenge, hindered by low resolution and background clutter. While fusing RGB and infrared (IR) data offers a promising solution, existing methods often struggle with the trade-off between effective cross-modal interaction and computational efficiency. In this letter, we introduce MambaRefine-YOLO. Its core contributions are a Dual-Gated Complementary Mamba fusion module (DGC-MFM) that adaptively balances RGB and IR modalities through illumination-aware and difference-aware gating mechanisms, and a Hierarchical Feature Aggregation Neck (HFAN) that uses a ``refine-then-fuse'' strategy to enhance multi-scale features. Our comprehensive experiments validate this dual-pronged approach. On the dual-modality DroneVehicle dataset, the full model achieves a state-of-the-art mAP of 83.2%, an improvement of 7.9% over the baseline. On the single-modality VisDrone dataset, a variant using only the HFAN also shows significant gains, demonstrating its general applicability. Our work presents a superior balance between accuracy and speed, making it highly suitable for real-world UAV applications.</description>

      <title>FilmSceneDesigner: Chaining Set Design for Procedural Film Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Film set design plays a pivotal role in cinematic storytelling and shaping the visual atmosphere. However, the traditional process depends on expert-driven manual modeling, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we introduce FilmSceneDesigner, an automated scene generation system that emulates professional film set design workflow. Given a natural language description, including scene type, historical period, and style, we design an agent-based chaining framework to generate structured parameters aligned with film set design workflow, guided by prompt strategies that ensure parameter accuracy and coherence. On the other hand, we propose a procedural generation pipeline which executes a series of dedicated functions with the structured parameters for floorplan and structure generation, material assignment, door and window placement, and object retrieval and layout, ultimately constructing a complete film scene from scratch. Moreover, to enhance cinematic realism and asset diversity, we construct SetDepot-Pro, a curated dataset of 6,862 film-specific 3D assets and 733 materials. Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate that our system produces structurally sound scenes with strong cinematic fidelity, supporting downstream tasks such as virtual previs, construction drawing and mood board creation.</description>

      <title>ABM-LoRA: Activation Boundary Matching for Fast Convergence in Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Activation Boundary Matching for Low-Rank Adaptation (ABM-LoRA), a principled initialization strategy that substantially accelerates the convergence of low-rank adapters. While LoRA offers high parameter efficiency, its random initialization restricts gradient updates to a mismatched tangent space, causing significant information loss and hindering early convergence. Our ABM-LoRA addresses this by aligning the adapter's activation boundaries with those of the pretrained model before downstream training, thereby maximizing the projection of full-parameter gradients into the adapter subspace. This alignment sharply reduces information loss at initialization, yields a lower starting loss, and accelerates convergence. We demonstrate ABM-LoRA's effectiveness across diverse architectures and tasks: language understanding (T5-Base on GLUE), dialogue generation (LLaMA2-7B on WizardLM), and vision recognition (ViT-B/16 on VTAB-1K). On VTAB-1K, it achieves the highest accuracy among all methods, with strong gains on structured reasoning tasks requiring geometric understanding.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Learning with Multiple Foundation Models for Source-Free Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without access to source data. Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs) have introduced new opportunities for leveraging external semantic knowledge to guide SFDA. However, relying on a single FM is often insufficient, as it tends to bias adaptation toward a restricted semantic coverage, failing to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shift. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Collaborative Multi-foundation Adaptation (CoMA) framework that jointly leverages two different FMs (e.g., CLIP and BLIP) with complementary properties to capture both global semantics and local contextual cues. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional adaptation mechanism that (1) aligns different FMs with the target model for task adaptation while maintaining their semantic distinctiveness, and (2) transfers complementary knowledge from the FMs to the target model. To ensure stable adaptation under mini-batch training, we introduce Decomposed Mutual Information (DMI) that selectively enhances true dependencies while suppressing false dependencies arising from incomplete class coverage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SFDA methods across four benchmarks, including Office-31, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA, under the closed-set setting, while also achieving best results on partial-set and open-set variants.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Posts: Retrieval-Augmented Fashion Captioning and Hashtag Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the retrieval-augmented framework for automatic fashion caption and hashtag generation, combining multi-garment detection, attribute reasoning, and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting. The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Preference Optimization for Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image restoration (IR) models are typically trained to recover high-quality images using L1 or LPIPS loss. To handle diverse unknown degradations, zero-shot IR methods have also been introduced. However, existing pre-trained and zero-shot IR approaches often fail to align with human preferences, resulting in restored images that may not be favored. This highlights the critical need to enhance restoration quality and adapt flexibly to various image restoration tasks or backbones without requiring model retraining and ideally without labor-intensive preference data collection. In this paper, we propose the first Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO) paradigm for image restoration, which enhances perceptual quality, generates preference data on-the-fly, and is compatible with any IR model backbone. Specifically, we design a training-free, three-stage pipeline: (i) generate candidate preference images online using diffusion inversion and denoising based on the initially restored image; (ii) select preferred and dispreferred images using automated preference-aligned metrics or human feedback; and (iii) use the selected preference images as reward signals to guide the diffusion denoising process, optimizing the restored image to better align with human preferences. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed pipeline.</description>

      <title>MetroGS: Efficient and Stable Reconstruction of Geometrically Accurate High-Fidelity Large-Scale Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting and its derivatives have achieved significant breakthroughs in large-scale scene reconstruction. However, how to efficiently and stably achieve high-quality geometric fidelity remains a core challenge. To address this issue, we introduce MetroGS, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework for efficient and robust reconstruction in complex urban environments. Our method is built upon a distributed 2D Gaussian Splatting representation as the core foundation, serving as a unified backbone for subsequent modules. To handle potential sparse regions in complex scenes, we propose a structured dense enhancement scheme that utilizes SfM priors and a pointmap model to achieve a denser initialization, while incorporating a sparsity compensation mechanism to improve reconstruction completeness. Furthermore, we design a progressive hybrid geometric optimization strategy that organically integrates monocular and multi-view optimization to achieve efficient and accurate geometric refinement. Finally, to address the appearance inconsistency commonly observed in large-scale scenes, we introduce a depth-guided appearance modeling approach that learns spatial features with 3D consistency, facilitating effective decoupling between geometry and appearance and further enhancing reconstruction stability. Experiments on large-scale urban datasets demonstrate that MetroGS achieves superior geometric accuracy, rendering quality, offering a unified solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Deep Learning and Traditional Approaches Used in Source Camera Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important tasks in computer vision is identifying the device using which the image was taken, useful for facilitating further comprehensive analysis of the image. This paper presents comparative analysis of three techniques used in source camera identification (SCI): Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU), JPEG compression artifact analysis, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It evaluates each method in terms of device classification accuracy. Furthermore, the research discusses the possible scientific development needed for the implementation of the methods in real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>nnActive: A Framework for Evaluation of Active Learning in 3D Biomedical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is crucial for various biomedical applications, yet its reliance on large annotated datasets presents a bottleneck due to the high cost and specialized expertise required for manual labeling. Active Learning (AL) aims to mitigate this challenge by querying only the most informative samples, thereby reducing annotation effort. However, in the domain of 3D biomedical imaging, there is no consensus on whether AL consistently outperforms Random sampling. Four evaluation pitfalls hinder the current methodological assessment. These are (1) restriction to too few datasets and annotation budgets, (2) using 2D models on 3D images without partial annotations, (3) Random baseline not being adapted to the task, and (4) measuring annotation cost only in voxels. In this work, we introduce nnActive, an open-source AL framework that overcomes these pitfalls by (1) means of a large scale study spanning four biomedical imaging datasets and three label regimes, (2) extending nnU-Net by using partial annotations for training with 3D patch-based query selection, (3) proposing Foreground Aware Random sampling strategies tackling the foreground-background class imbalance of medical images and (4) propose the foreground efficiency metric, which captures the low annotation cost of background-regions. We reveal the following findings: (A) while all AL methods outperform standard Random sampling, none reliably surpasses an improved Foreground Aware Random sampling; (B) benefits of AL depend on task specific parameters; (C) Predictive Entropy is overall the best performing AL method, but likely requires the most annotation effort; (D) AL performance can be improved with more compute intensive design choices. As a holistic, open-source framework, nnActive can serve as a catalyst for research and application of AL in 3D biomedical imaging. Code is at: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnActive</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting deepfake images is crucial in combating misinformation. We present a lightweight, generalizable binary classification model based on EfficientNet-B6, fine-tuned with transformation techniques to address severe class imbalances. By leveraging robust preprocessing, oversampling, and optimization strategies, our model achieves high accuracy, stability, and generalization. While incorporating Fourier transform-based phase and amplitude features showed minimal impact, our proposed framework helps non-experts to effectively identify deepfake images, making significant strides toward accessible and reliable deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Anatomical Data Generation Based on Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical planning and training based on machine learning requires a large amount of 3D anatomical models reconstructed from medical imaging, which is currently one of the major bottlenecks. Obtaining these data from real patients and during surgery is very demanding, if even possible, due to legal, ethical, and technical challenges. It is especially difficult for soft tissue organs with poor imaging contrast, such as the prostate. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel workflow for automated 3D anatomical data generation using data obtained from physical organ models. We additionally use a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to obtain a manifold of 3D models useful for other downstream machine learning tasks that rely on 3D data. We demonstrate our workflow using an artificial prostate model made of biomimetic hydrogels with imaging contrast in multiple zones. This is used to physically simulate endoscopic surgery. For evaluation and 3D data generation, we place it into a customized ultrasound scanner that records the prostate before and after the procedure. A neural network is trained to segment the recorded ultrasound images, which outperforms conventional, non-learning-based computer vision techniques in terms of intersection over union (IoU). Based on the segmentations, a 3D mesh model is reconstructed, and performance feedback is provided.</description>

      <title>CLASH: A Benchmark for Cross-Modal Contradiction Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contradictory multimodal inputs are common in real-world settings, yet existing benchmarks typically assume input consistency and fail to evaluate cross-modal contradiction detection - a fundamental capability for preventing hallucinations and ensuring reliability. We introduce CLASH, a novel benchmark for multimodal contradiction detection, featuring COCO images paired with contradictory captions containing controlled object-level or attribute-level contradictions. The samples include targeted questions evaluated in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. The benchmark provides an extensive fine-tuning set filtered through automated quality checks, alongside a smaller human-verified diagnostic set. Our analysis of state-of-the-art models reveals substantial limitations in recognizing cross-modal conflicts, exposing systematic modality biases and category-specific weaknesses. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that targeted fine-tuning on CLASH substantially enhances conflict detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Can Modern Vision Models Understand the Difference Between an Object and a Look-alike?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have yielded models with strong performance on recognition benchmarks; however, significant gaps remain in comparison to human perception. One subtle ability is to judge whether an image looks like a given object without being an instance of that object. We study whether vision-language models such as CLIP capture this distinction. We curated a dataset named RoLA (Real or Lookalike) of real and lookalike exemplars (e.g., toys, statues, drawings, pareidolia) across multiple categories, and first evaluate a prompt-based baseline with paired "real"/"lookalike" prompts. We then estimate a direction in CLIP's embedding space that moves representations between real and lookalike. Applying this direction to image and text embeddings improves discrimination in cross-modal retrieval on Conceptual12M, and also enhances captions produced by a CLIP prefix captioner.</description>

      <title>NVGS: Neural Visibility for Occlusion Culling in 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting can exploit frustum culling and level-of-detail strategies to accelerate rendering of scenes containing a large number of primitives. However, the semi-transparent nature of Gaussians prevents the application of another highly effective technique: occlusion culling. We address this limitation by proposing a novel method to learn the viewpoint-dependent visibility function of all Gaussians in a trained model using a small, shared MLP across instances of an asset in a scene. By querying it for Gaussians within the viewing frustum prior to rasterization, our method can discard occluded primitives during rendering. Leveraging Tensor Cores for efficient computation, we integrate these neural queries directly into a novel instanced software rasterizer. Our approach outperforms the current state of the art for composed scenes in terms of VRAM usage and image quality, utilizing a combination of our instanced rasterizer and occlusion culling MLP, and exhibits complementary properties to existing LoD techniques.</description>

      <title>ReAlign: Text-to-Motion Generation via Step-Aware Reward-Guided Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from text inputs, holds immense potential for applications in gaming, film, and robotics. Recently, diffusion-based methods have been shown to generate more diversity and realistic motion. However, there exists a misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, which leads to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address this limitation, we propose Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign), comprising a step-aware reward model to assess alignment quality during the denoising sampling and a reward-guided strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density and alignment. Extensive experiments of both motion generation and retrieval tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Are Large Vision Language Models Truly Grounded in Medical Images? Evidence from Italian Clinical Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on medical visual question answering benchmarks, yet their reliance on visual information remains unclear. We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis. These findings highlight critical differences in model robustness and the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Percept-WAM: Perception-Enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model for Robust End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving heavily relies on accurate and robust spatial perception. Many failures arise from inaccuracies and instability, especially in long-tail scenarios and complex interactions. However, current vision-language models are weak at spatial grounding and understanding, and VLA systems built on them therefore show limited perception and localization ability. To address these challenges, we introduce Percept-WAM, a perception-enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model that is the first to implicitly integrate 2D/3D scene understanding abilities within a single vision-language model (VLM). Instead of relying on QA-style spatial reasoning, Percept-WAM unifies 2D/3D perception tasks into World-PV and World-BEV tokens, which encode both spatial coordinates and confidence. We propose a grid-conditioned prediction mechanism for dense object perception, incorporating IoU-aware scoring and parallel autoregressive decoding, improving stability in long-tail, far-range, and small-object scenarios. Additionally, Percept-WAM leverages pretrained VLM parameters to retain general intelligence (e.g., logical reasoning) and can output perception results and trajectory control outputs directly. Experiments show that Percept-WAM matches or surpasses classical detectors and segmenters on downstream perception benchmarks, achieving 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO 2D detection and nuScenes BEV 3D detection. When integrated with trajectory decoders, it further improves planning performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM, e.g., surpassing DiffusionDrive by 2.1 in PMDS on NAVSIM. Qualitative results further highlight its strong open-vocabulary and long-tail generalization.</description>

      <title>Learning Plug-and-play Memory for Guiding Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformer(DiT) based video generation models have recently achieved impressive visual quality and temporal coherence, but they still frequently violate basic physical laws and commonsense dynamics, revealing a lack of explicit world knowledge. In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving physical rule following and video fidelity. Our code and data are publicly released here: https://thrcle421.github.io/DiT-Mem-Web/.</description>

      <title>IDSplat: Instance-Decomposed 3D Gaussian Splatting for Driving Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes is essential for developing autonomous systems through sensor-realistic simulation. Although recent methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, they either rely on costly human annotations for object trajectories or use time-varying representations without explicit object-level decomposition, leading to intertwined static and dynamic elements that hinder scene separation. We present IDSplat, a self-supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs dynamic scenes with explicit instance decomposition and learnable motion trajectories, without requiring human annotations. Our key insight is to model dynamic objects as coherent instances undergoing rigid transformations, rather than unstructured time-varying primitives. For instance decomposition, we employ zero-shot, language-grounded video tracking anchored to 3D using lidar, and estimate consistent poses via feature correspondences. We introduce a coordinated-turn smoothing scheme to obtain temporally and physically consistent motion trajectories, mitigating pose misalignments and tracking failures, followed by joint optimization of object poses and Gaussian parameters. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction quality while maintaining instance-level decomposition and generalizes across diverse sequences and view densities without retraining, making it practical for large-scale autonomous driving applications. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Patch Attacks on Vision-Based Cargo Occupancy Estimation via Differentiable 3D Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer vision systems are increasingly adopted in modern logistics operations, including the estimation of trailer occupancy for planning, routing, and billing. Although effective, such systems may be vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patches that can be printed and placed on interior surfaces. In this work, we study the feasibility of such attacks on a convolutional cargo-occupancy classifier using fully simulated 3D environments. Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate adversarial patch attacks for cargo-occupancy estimation in physically realistic, fully simulated 3D scenes.</description>

      <title>LAST: LeArning to Think in Space and Time for Generalist Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can perceive and understand 3D space and long videos from sequential visual observations. But do vision-language models (VLMs) can? Recent work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle to understand 3D space and long videos, although they are powerful in typical vision-language tasks. Current methods often rely on specialized architectural designs to improve performance for 3D tasks and video understanding tasks separately. In contrast, we propose LAST, short for LeArn to Think in Space and Time, to jointly improve 3D spatial and long video understanding for general VLMs with only a set of 2D images as inputs. LAST makes VLMs think in space and time rather than only with text before giving the final answer, building visual thinking trajectories in 3D space and temporal dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAST in two scenarios: 1) zero-shot, where we directly prompt proprietary models; and 2) fine-tuning general VLMs with data that include thinking trajectories in 3D space and time. We show that LAST brings substantial gains in various benchmarks, including 3 spatial understanding, 4 video understanding, and 3 image understanding tasks. Notably, 15.8% gains on EgoSchema with GPT-4o in a zero-shot manner and 8.3 gains on VSI-Bench compared with Qwen2.5-VL-7B.</description>

Abstract: Conditional image generation enhances text-to-image synthesis with structural, spatial, or stylistic priors, but current methods face challenges in handling conflicts between sources. These include 1) input-level conflicts, where the conditioning image contradicts the text prompt, and 2) model-bias conflicts, where generative biases disrupt alignment even when conditions match the text. Addressing these conflicts requires nuanced solutions, which standard supervised fine-tuning struggles to provide. Preference-based optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) show promise but are limited by gradient entanglement between text and condition signals and lack disentangled training data for multi-constraint tasks. To overcome this, we propose a bidirectionally decoupled DPO framework (BideDPO). Our method creates two disentangled preference pairs-one for the condition and one for the text-to reduce gradient entanglement. The influence of pairs is managed using an Adaptive Loss Balancing strategy for balanced optimization. We introduce an automated data pipeline to sample model outputs and generate conflict-aware data. This process is embedded in an iterative optimization strategy that refines both the model and the data. We construct a DualAlign benchmark to evaluate conflict resolution between text and condition. Experiments show BideDPO significantly improves text success rates (e.g., +35%) and condition adherence. We also validate our approach using the COCO dataset.

      <title>Diffusion Reconstruction-based Data Likelihood Estimation for Core-Set Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing core-set selection methods predominantly rely on heuristic scoring signals such as training dynamics or model uncertainty, lacking explicit modeling of data likelihood. This omission may hinder the constructed subset from capturing subtle yet critical distributional structures that underpin effective model training. In this work, we propose a novel, theoretically grounded approach that leverages diffusion models to estimate data likelihood via reconstruction deviation induced by partial reverse denoising. Specifically, we establish a formal connection between reconstruction error and data likelihood, grounded in the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of Markovian diffusion processes, thereby enabling a principled, distribution-aware scoring criterion for data selection. Complementarily, we introduce an efficient information-theoretic method to identify the optimal reconstruction timestep, ensuring that the deviation provides a reliable signal indicative of underlying data likelihood. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that reconstruction deviation offers an effective scoring criterion, consistently outperforming existing baselines across selection ratios, and closely matching full-data training using only 50% of the data. Further analysis shows that the likelihood-informed nature of our score reveals informative insights in data selection, shedding light on the interplay between data distributional characteristics and model learning preferences.</description>

      <title>ReMatch: Boosting Representation through Matching for Multimodal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ReMatch, a framework that leverages the generative strength of MLLMs for multimodal retrieval. Previous approaches treated an MLLM as a simple encoder, ignoring its generative nature, and under-utilising its compositional reasoning and world knowledge. We instead train the embedding MLLM end-to-end with a chat-style generative matching stage. The matching stage uses the same MLLM to autoregressively decide relevance from multi-view inputs, including both raw data and its own projected embeddings for each query and document. It provides instance-wise discrimination supervision that complements a standard contrastive loss, offering stronger gradients on hard negatives and preserving the compositional strengths of the original MLLM. To obtain semantically richer multimodal embeddings, we use multiple learnable tokens to augment each input, generating fine-grained contextual, mutually orthogonal embeddings with low inference cost. Leveraging our established high-performance baseline,we assemble the ideas mentioned above into a powerful training recipe and achieve a new state-of-the-art on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB). Our experiments show particularly strong zero-shot generalization results on five datasets, highlighting the robustness and transferability of ReMatch.</description>

      <title>DensifyBeforehand: LiDAR-assisted Content-aware Densification for Efficient and Quality 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods, particularly their reliance on adaptive density control, which can lead to floating artifacts and inefficient resource usage. We propose a novel densify beforehand approach that enhances the initialization of 3D scenes by combining sparse LiDAR data with monocular depth estimation from corresponding RGB images. Our ROI-aware sampling scheme prioritizes semantically and geometrically important regions, yielding a dense point cloud that improves visual fidelity and computational efficiency. This densify beforehand approach bypasses the adaptive density control that may introduce redundant Gaussians in the original pipeline, allowing the optimization to focus on the other attributes of 3D Gaussian primitives, reducing overlap while enhancing visual quality. Our method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art techniques while significantly lowering resource consumption and training time. We validate our approach through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on four newly collected datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving regions of interest in complex scenes.</description>

      <title>IDEAL-M3D: Instance Diversity-Enriched Active Learning for Monocular 3D Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D detection relies on just a single camera and is therefore easy to deploy. Yet, achieving reliable 3D understanding from monocular images requires substantial annotation, and 3D labels are especially costly. To maximize performance under constrained labeling budgets, it is essential to prioritize annotating samples expected to deliver the largest performance gains. This prioritization is the focus of active learning. Curiously, we observed two significant limitations in active learning algorithms for 3D monocular object detection. First, previous approaches select entire images, which is inefficient, as non-informative instances contained in the same image also need to be labeled. Secondly, existing methods rely on uncertainty-based selection, which in monocular 3D object detection creates a bias toward depth ambiguity. Consequently, distant objects are selected, while nearby objects are overlooked.
  To address these limitations, we propose IDEAL-M3D, the first instance-level pipeline for monocular 3D detection. For the first time, we demonstrate that an explicitly diverse, fast-to-train ensemble improves diversity-driven active learning for monocular 3D. We induce diversity with heterogeneous backbones and task-agnostic features, loss weight perturbation, and time-dependent bagging. IDEAL-M3D shows superior performance and significant resource savings: with just 60% of the annotations, we achieve similar or better AP3D on KITTI validation and test set results compared to training the same detector on the whole dataset.</description>

      <title>Dual-Granularity Semantic Prompting for Language Guidance Infrared Small Target Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared small target detection remains challenging due to limited feature representation and severe background interference, resulting in sub-optimal performance. While recent CLIP-inspired methods attempt to leverage textual guidance for detection, they are hindered by inaccurate text descriptions and reliance on manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we propose DGSPNet, an end-to-end language prompt-driven framework. Our approach integrates dual-granularity semantic prompts: coarse-grained textual priors (e.g., 'infrared image', 'small target') and fine-grained personalized semantic descriptions derived through visual-to-textual mapping within the image space. This design not only facilitates learning fine-grained semantic information but also can inherently leverage language prompts during inference without relying on any annotation requirements. By fully leveraging the precision and conciseness of text descriptions, we further introduce a text-guide channel attention (TGCA) mechanism and text-guide spatial attention (TGSA) mechanism that enhances the model's sensitivity to potential targets across both low- and high-level feature spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves detection accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Dataset Watermarking for Fine-tuning Traceability of Customized Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Removal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent fine-tuning techniques for diffusion models enable them to reproduce specific image sets, such as particular faces or artistic styles, but also introduce copyright and security risks. Dataset watermarking has been proposed to ensure traceability by embedding imperceptible watermarks into training images, which remain detectable in outputs even after fine-tuning. However, current methods lack a unified evaluation framework. To address this, this paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness. Experiments show that existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and exhibit some robustness against common image processing operations, yet still fall short under real-world threat scenarios. To reveal these vulnerabilities, the paper further proposes a practical watermark removal method that fully eliminates dataset watermarks without affecting fine-tuning, highlighting a key challenge for future research.</description>

      <title>SyncMV4D: Synchronized Multi-view Joint Diffusion of Appearance and Motion for Hand-Object Interaction Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation plays a critical role in advancing applications across animation and robotics. Current video-based methods are predominantly single-view, which impedes comprehensive 3D geometry perception and often results in geometric distortions or unrealistic motion patterns. While 3D HOI approaches can generate dynamically plausible motions, their dependence on high-quality 3D data captured in controlled laboratory settings severely limits their generalization to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyncMV4D, the first model that jointly generates synchronized multi-view HOI videos and 4D motions by unifying visual prior, motion dynamics, and multi-view geometry. Our framework features two core innovations: (1) a Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) model that co-generates HOI videos and intermediate motions, and (2) a Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) that refines the coarse intermediate motion into globally aligned 4D metric point tracks. To tightly couple 2D appearance with 4D dynamics, we establish a closed-loop, mutually enhancing cycle. During the diffusion denoising process, the generated video conditions the refinement of the 4D motion, while the aligned 4D point tracks are reprojected to guide next-step joint generation. Experimentally, our method demonstrates superior performance to state-of-the-art alternatives in visual realism, motion plausibility, and multi-view consistency.</description>

      <title>SteadyDancer: Harmonized and Coherent Human Image Animation with First-Frame Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preserving first-frame identity while ensuring precise motion control is a fundamental challenge in human image animation. The Image-to-Motion Binding process of the dominant Reference-to-Video (R2V) paradigm overlooks critical spatio-temporal misalignments common in real-world applications, leading to failures such as identity drift and visual artifacts. We introduce SteadyDancer, an Image-to-Video (I2V) paradigm-based framework that achieves harmonized and coherent animation and is the first to ensure first-frame preservation robustly. Firstly, we propose a Condition-Reconciliation Mechanism to harmonize the two conflicting conditions, enabling precise control without sacrificing fidelity. Secondly, we design Synergistic Pose Modulation Modules to generate an adaptive and coherent pose representation that is highly compatible with the reference image. Finally, we employ a Staged Decoupled-Objective Training Pipeline that hierarchically optimizes the model for motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence. Experiments demonstrate that SteadyDancer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance fidelity and motion control, while requiring significantly fewer training resources than comparable methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing biomechanically realistic 3D human motion - recovering both kinematics (motion) and kinetics (forces) - is a critical challenge. While marker-based systems are lab-bound and slow, popular monocular methods use oversimplified, anatomically inaccurate models (e.g., SMPL) and ignore physics, fundamentally limiting their biomechanical fidelity. In this work, we introduce MonoMSK, a hybrid framework that bridges data-driven learning and physics-based simulation for biomechanically realistic 3D human motion estimation from monocular video. MonoMSK jointly recovers both kinematics (motions) and kinetics (forces and torques) through an anatomically accurate musculoskeletal model. By integrating transformer-based inverse dynamics with differentiable forward kinematics and dynamics layers governed by ODE-based simulation, MonoMSK establishes a physics-regulated inverse-forward loop that enforces biomechanical causality and physical plausibility. A novel forward-inverse consistency loss further aligns motion reconstruction with the underlying kinetic reasoning. Experiments on BML-MoVi, BEDLAM, and OpenCap show that MonoMSK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in kinematic accuracy, while for the first time enabling precise monocular kinetics estimation.</description>

      <title>POUR: A Provably Optimal Method for Unlearning Representations via Neural Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computer vision, machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific visual concepts or training images without retraining from scratch. Studies show that existing approaches often modify the classifier while leaving internal representations intact, resulting in incomplete forgetting. In this work, we extend the notion of unlearning to the representation level, deriving a three-term interplay between forgetting efficacy, retention fidelity, and class separation. Building on Neural Collapse theory, we show that the orthogonal projection of a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) remains an ETF in a lower dimensional space, yielding a provably optimal forgetting operator. We further introduce the Representation Unlearning Score (RUS) to quantify representation-level forgetting and retention fidelity. Building on this, we introduce POUR (Provably Optimal Unlearning of Representations), a geometric projection method with closed-form (POUR-P) and a feature-level unlearning variant under a distillation scheme (POUR-D). Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and PathMNIST demonstrate that POUR achieves effective unlearning while preserving retained knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art unlearning methods on both classification-level and representation-level metrics.</description>

      <title>Syn-GRPO: Self-Evolving Data Synthesis for MLLM Perception Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RL (reinforcement learning) methods (e.g., GRPO) for MLLM (Multimodal LLM) perception ability has attracted wide research interest owing to its remarkable generalization ability. Nevertheless, existing reinforcement learning methods still face the problem of low data quality, where data samples cannot elicit diverse responses from MLLMs, thus restricting the exploration scope for MLLM reinforcement learning. Some methods attempt to mitigate this problem by imposing constraints on entropy, but none address it at its root. Therefore, to tackle this problem, this work proposes Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO), which employs an online data generator to synthesize high-quality training data with diverse responses in GRPO training. Specifically, Syn-GRPO consists of two components: (1) data server; (2) GRPO workflow. The data server synthesizes new samples from existing ones using an image generation model, featuring a decoupled and asynchronous scheme to achieve high generation efficiency. The GRPO workflow provides the data server with the new image descriptions, and it leverages a diversity reward to supervise the MLLM to predict image descriptions for synthesizing samples with diverse responses. Experiment results across three visual perception tasks demonstrate that Syn-GRPO improves the data quality by a large margin, achieving significant superior performance to existing MLLM perception methods, and Syn-GRPO presents promising potential for scaling long-term self-evolving RL.

      <title>CellFMCount: A Fluorescence Microscopy Dataset, Benchmark, and Methods for Cell Counting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate cell counting is essential in various biomedical research and clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis, stem cell research, and immunology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, motivating automation through deep learning techniques. However, training reliable deep learning models requires large amounts of high-quality annotated data, which is difficult and time-consuming to produce manually. Consequently, existing cell-counting datasets are often limited, frequently containing fewer than $500$ images. In this work, we introduce a large-scale annotated dataset comprising $3{,}023$ images from immunocytochemistry experiments related to cellular differentiation, containing over $430{,}000$ manually annotated cell locations. The dataset presents significant challenges: high cell density, overlapping and morphologically diverse cells, a long-tailed distribution of cell count per image, and variation in staining protocols. We benchmark three categories of existing methods: regression-based, crowd-counting, and cell-counting techniques on a test set with cell counts ranging from $10$ to $2{,}126$ cells per image. We also evaluate how the Segment Anything Model (SAM) can be adapted for microscopy cell counting using only dot-annotated datasets. As a case study, we implement a density-map-based adaptation of SAM (SAM-Counter) and report a mean absolute error (MAE) of $22.12$, which outperforms existing approaches (second-best MAE of $27.46$). Our results underscore the value of the dataset and the benchmarking framework for driving progress in automated cell counting and provide a robust foundation for future research and development.</description>

      <title>Growing with the Generator: Self-paced GRPO for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning paradigm for post-training video generation models. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on static, fixed-capacity reward models whose evaluation behavior is frozen during training. Such rigid rewards introduce distributional bias, saturate quickly as the generator improves, and ultimately limit the stability and effectiveness of reinforcement-based alignment. We propose Self-Paced GRPO, a competence-aware GRPO framework in which reward feedback co-evolves with the generator. Our method introduces a progressive reward mechanism that automatically shifts its emphasis from coarse visual fidelity to temporal coherence and fine-grained text-video semantic alignment as generation quality increases. This self-paced curriculum alleviates reward-policy mismatch, mitigates reward exploitation, and yields more stable optimization. Experiments on VBench across multiple video generation backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in both visual quality and semantic alignment over GRPO baselines with static rewards, validating the effectiveness and generality of Self-Paced GRPO.</description>

      <title>DeCo: Frequency-Decoupled Pixel Diffusion for End-to-End Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison.

      <title>An Anatomy Aware Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Lung Cancer Tumor Stage Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate lung cancer tumor staging is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that embeds explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks that operate in an uninterpretable "black box" manner, our method offers both state-of-the-art performance and transparent decision support.</description>

      <title>UISearch: Graph-Based Embeddings for Multimodal Enterprise UI Screenshots Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprise software companies maintain thousands of user interface screens across products and versions, creating critical challenges for design consistency, pattern discovery, and compliance check. Existing approaches rely on visual similarity or text semantics, lacking explicit modeling of structural properties fundamental to user interface (UI) composition. We present a novel graph-based representation that converts UI screenshots into attributed graphs encoding hierarchical relationships and spatial arrangements, potentially generalizable to document layouts, architectural diagrams, and other structured visual domains. A contrastive graph autoencoder learns embeddings preserving multi-level similarity across visual, structural, and semantic properties. The comprehensive analysis demonstrates that our structural embeddings achieve better discriminative power than state-of-the-art Vision Encoders, representing a fundamental advance in the expressiveness of the UI representation. We implement this representation in UISearch, a multi-modal search framework that combines structural embeddings with semantic search through a composable query language. On 20,396 financial software UIs, UISearch achieves 0.92 Top-5 accuracy with 47.5ms median latency (P95: 124ms), scaling to 20,000+ screens. The hybrid indexing architecture enables complex queries and supports fine-grained UI distinction impossible with vision-only approaches.</description>

      <title>BackSplit: The Importance of Sub-dividing the Background in Biomedical Lesion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmenting small lesions in medical images remains notoriously difficult. Most prior work tackles this challenge by either designing better architectures, loss functions, or data augmentation schemes; and collecting more labeled data. We take a different view, arguing that part of the problem lies in how the background is modeled. Common lesion segmentation collapses all non-lesion pixels into a single "background" class, ignoring the rich anatomical context in which lesions appear. In reality, the background is highly heterogeneous-composed of tissues, organs, and other structures that can now be labeled manually or inferred automatically using existing segmentation models.
  In this paper, we argue that training with fine-grained labels that sub-divide the background class, which we call BackSplit, is a simple yet powerful paradigm that can offer a significant performance boost without increasing inference costs. From an information theoretic standpoint, we prove that BackSplit increases the expected Fisher Information relative to conventional binary training, leading to tighter asymptotic bounds and more stable optimization. With extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures, we empirically show that BackSplit consistently boosts small-lesion segmentation performance, even when auxiliary labels are generated automatically using pretrained segmentation models. Additionally, we demonstrate that auxiliary labels derived from interactive segmentation frameworks exhibit the same beneficial effect, demonstrating its robustness, simplicity, and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>In-Video Instructions: Visual Signals as Generative Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale video generative models have recently demonstrated strong visual capabilities, enabling the prediction of future frames that adhere to the logical and physical cues in the current observation. In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Visual-Thought: Teaching VLMs to See and Think Better with Continuous Visual Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.</description>

      <title>SAM3-Adapter: Efficient Adaptation of Segment Anything 3 for Camouflage Object Segmentation, Shadow Detection, and Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rise of large-scale foundation models has reshaped the landscape of image segmentation, with models such as Segment Anything achieving unprecedented versatility across diverse vision tasks. However, previous generations-including SAM and its successor-still struggle with fine-grained, low-level segmentation challenges such as camouflaged object detection, medical image segmentation, cell image segmentation, and shadow detection. To address these limitations, we originally proposed SAM-Adapter in 2023, demonstrating substantial gains on these difficult scenarios. With the emergence of Segment Anything 3 (SAM3)-a more efficient and higher-performing evolution with a redesigned architecture and improved training pipeline-we revisit these long-standing challenges. In this work, we present SAM3-Adapter, the first adapter framework tailored for SAM3 that unlocks its full segmentation capability. SAM3-Adapter not only reduces computational overhead but also consistently surpasses both SAM and SAM2-based solutions, establishing new state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks, including medical imaging, camouflaged (concealed) object segmentation, and shadow detection. Built upon the modular and composable design philosophy of the original SAM-Adapter, SAM3-Adapter provides stronger generalizability, richer task adaptability, and significantly improved segmentation precision. Extensive experiments confirm that integrating SAM3 with our adapter yields superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared to all prior SAM-based adaptations. We hope SAM3-Adapter can serve as a foundation for future research and practical segmentation applications. Code, pre-trained models, and data processing pipelines are available.</description>

      <title>Ref-SAM3D: Bridging SAM3D with Text for Reference 3D Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SAM3D has garnered widespread attention for its strong 3D object reconstruction capabilities. However, a key limitation remains: SAM3D cannot reconstruct specific objects referred to by textual descriptions, a capability that is essential for practical applications such as 3D editing, game development, and virtual environments. To address this gap, we introduce Ref-SAM3D, a simple yet effective extension to SAM3D that incorporates textual descriptions as a high-level prior, enabling text-guided 3D reconstruction from a single RGB image. Through extensive qualitative experiments, we show that Ref-SAM3D, guided only by natural language and a single 2D view, delivers competitive and high-fidelity zero-shot reconstruction performance. Our results demonstrate that Ref-SAM3D effectively bridges the gap between 2D visual cues and 3D geometric understanding, offering a more flexible and accessible paradigm for reference-guided 3D reconstruction.

      <title>Cook and Clean Together: Teaching Embodied Agents for Parallel Task Execution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task scheduling is critical for embodied AI, enabling agents to follow natural language instructions and execute actions efficiently in 3D physical worlds. However, existing datasets often simplify task planning by ignoring operations research (OR) knowledge and 3D spatial grounding. In this work, we propose Operations Research knowledge-based 3D Grounded Task Scheduling (ORS3D), a new task that requires the synergy of language understanding, 3D grounding, and efficiency optimization. Unlike prior settings, ORS3D demands that agents minimize total completion time by leveraging parallelizable subtasks, e.g., cleaning the sink while the microwave operates. To facilitate research on ORS3D, we construct ORS3D-60K, a large-scale dataset comprising 60K composite tasks across 4K real-world scenes. Furthermore, we propose GRANT, an embodied multi-modal large language model equipped with a simple yet effective scheduling token mechanism to generate efficient task schedules and grounded actions. Extensive experiments on ORS3D-60K validate the effectiveness of GRANT across language understanding, 3D grounding, and scheduling efficiency.

      <description>arXiv:2511.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been great progress in improving numerical weather prediction and climate models using machine learning. However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($&lt;10\%$) against collocated radar measurements. Code and data are available on our project page https://cloud4d.jacob-lin.com/.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Likelihood-Quality Trade-off in Diffusion Models by Merging Pretrained Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Are Image-to-Video Models Good Zero-Shot Image Editors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale video diffusion models show strong world simulation and temporal reasoning abilities, but their use as zero-shot image editors remains underexplored. We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning.</description>

      <title>VDC-Agent: When Video Detailed Captioners Evolve Themselves via Agentic Self-Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VDC-Agent, a self-evolving framework for Video Detailed Captioning that requires neither human annotations nor larger teacher models. The agent forms a closed loop of caption generation, principle-guided scoring (score and textual suggestions), and prompt refinement. When caption quality regresses, a self-reflection path leverages the previous chain-of-thought to amend the update. Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.</description>

      <title>LumiTex: Towards High-Fidelity PBR Texture Generation with Illumination Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) provides a principled standard for realistic material-lighting interactions in computer graphics. Despite recent advances in generating PBR textures, existing methods fail to address two fundamental challenges: 1) materials decomposition from image prompts under limited illumination cues, and 2) seamless and view-consistent texture completion. To this end, we propose LumiTex, an end-to-end framework that comprises three key components: (1) a multi-branch generation scheme that disentangles albedo and metallic-roughness under shared illumination priors for robust material understanding, (2) a lighting-aware material attention mechanism that injects illumination context into the decoding process for physically grounded generation of albedo, metallic, and roughness maps, and (3) a geometry-guided inpainting module based on a large view synthesis model that enriches texture coverage and ensures seamless, view-consistent UV completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LumiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in texture quality, surpassing both existing open-source and commercial methods.</description>

Abstract: Harnessing the power of diffusion models to synthesize auxiliary training data based on latent space features has proven effective in enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, extracting effective features outside the in-distribution (ID) boundary in latent space remains challenging due to the difficulty of identifying decision boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a novel framework called Boundary-based Out-Of-Distribution data generation (BOOD), which synthesizes high-quality OOD features and generates human-compatible outlier images using diffusion models. BOOD first learns a text-conditioned latent feature space from the ID dataset, selects ID features closest to the decision boundary, and perturbs them to cross the decision boundary to form OOD features. These synthetic OOD features are then decoded into images in pixel space by a diffusion model. Compared to previous works, BOOD provides a more training efficient strategy for synthesizing informative OOD features, facilitating clearer distinctions between ID and OOD data. Extensive experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that BOOD surpasses the state-of-the-art method significantly, achieving a 29.64% decrease in average FPR95 (40.31% vs. 10.67%) and a 7.27% improvement in average AUROC (90.15% vs. 97.42%) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.</description>

      <title>Saving Foundation Flow-Matching Priors for Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Lightweight RGB Object Tracking for Augmented Reality Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) applications often require robust real-time tracking of objects in the user's environment to correctly overlay virtual content. Recent advances in computer vision have produced highly accurate deep learning-based object trackers, but these models are typically too heavy in computation and memory for wearable AR devices. In this paper, we present a lightweight RGB object tracking algorithm designed specifically for resource-constrained AR platforms. The proposed tracker employs a compact Siamese neural network architecture and incorporates optimization techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to drastically reduce model size and inference cost while maintaining high tracking accuracy. We train the tracker offline on large video datasets using deep convolutional neural networks and then deploy it on-device for real-time tracking. Experimental results on standard tracking benchmarks show that our approach achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art trackers, yet runs in real-time on a mobile AR headset at around 30 FPS -- more than an order of magnitude faster than prior high-performance trackers on the same hardware. This work enables practical, robust object tracking for AR use-cases, opening the door to more interactive and dynamic AR experiences on lightweight devices.</description>

      <title>SYNAPSE: Synergizing an Adapter and Finetuning for High-Fidelity EEG Synthesis from a CLIP-Aligned Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based generative models has enabled high-quality image synthesis conditioned on diverse modalities. Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced. These results suggest that reconstructing what the brain perceives, rather than what it classifies, is key to faithful EEG-based image generation.</description>

      <title>Classification of Transient Astronomical Object Light Curves Using LSTM Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for classifying transient astronomical object light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) dataset. The original fourteen object classes were reorganized into five generalized categories (S-Like, Fast, Long, Periodic, and Non-Periodic) to address class imbalance. After preprocessing with padding, temporal rescaling, and flux normalization, a bidirectional LSTM network with masking layers was trained and evaluated on a test set of 19,920 objects. The model achieved strong performance for S-Like and Periodic classes, with ROC area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.95 and 0.99, and Precision-Recall AUC values of 0.98 and 0.89, respectively. However, performance was significantly lower for Fast and Long classes (ROC AUC of 0.68 for Long class), and the model exhibited difficulty distinguishing between Periodic and Non-Periodic objects. Evaluation on partial light curve data (5, 10,and 20 days from detection) revealed substantial performance degradation, with increased misclassification toward the S-Like class. These findings indicate that class imbalance and limited temporal information are primary limitations, suggesting that class balancing strategies and preprocessing techniques focusing on detection moments could improve performance.</description>

      <title>Temporal-adaptive Weight Quantization for Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weight quantization in spiking neural networks (SNNs) could further reduce energy consumption. However, quantizing weights without sacrificing accuracy remains challenging. In this study, inspired by astrocyte-mediated synaptic modulation in the biological nervous systems, we propose Temporal-adaptive Weight Quantization (TaWQ), which incorporates weight quantization with temporal dynamics to adaptively allocate ultra-low-bit weights along the temporal dimension. Extensive experiments on static (e.g., ImageNet) and neuromorphic (e.g., CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate that our TaWQ maintains high energy efficiency (4.12M, 0.63mJ) while incurring a negligible quantization loss of only 0.22% on ImageNet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the cognitive and experiential factors of human navigation is central to deepening our understanding of human-environment interaction and to enabling safe social navigation and effective assistive wayfinding. Most existing methods focus on forecasting motions in fully observed scenes and often neglect human factors that capture how people feel and respond to space. To address this gap, We propose EgoCogNav, a multimodal egocentric navigation framework that predicts perceived path uncertainty as a latent state and jointly forecasts trajectories and head motion by fusing scene features with sensory cues. To facilitate research in the field, we introduce the Cognition-aware Egocentric Navigation (CEN) dataset consisting 6 hours of real-world egocentric recordings capturing diverse navigation behaviors in real-world scenarios. Experiments show that EgoCogNav learns the perceived uncertainty that highly correlates with human-like behaviors such as scanning, hesitation, and backtracking while generalizing to unseen environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Straight Flows: Variational Flow Matching for Efficient Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow Matching has limited ability in achieving one-step generation due to its reliance on learned curved trajectories. Previous studies have attempted to address this limitation by either modifying the coupling distribution to prevent interpolant intersections or introducing consistency and mean-velocity modeling to promote straight trajectory learning. However, these approaches often suffer from discrete approximation errors, training instability, and convergence difficulties. To tackle these issues, in the present work, we propose \textbf{S}traight \textbf{V}ariational \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching (\textbf{S-VFM}), which integrates a variational latent code representing the ``generation overview'' into the Flow Matching framework. \textbf{S-VFM} explicitly enforces trajectory straightness, ideally producing linear generation paths. The proposed method achieves competitive performance across three challenge benchmarks and demonstrates advantages in both training and inference efficiency compared with existing methods.</description>

      <title>PaSE: Prototype-aligned Calibration and Shapley-based Equilibrium for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by integrating textual, acoustic, and visual signals. Although multimodal fusion is designed to leverage cross-modal complementarity, real-world scenarios often exhibit modality competition: dominant modalities tend to overshadow weaker ones, leading to suboptimal performance.In this paper, we propose PaSE, a novel Prototype-aligned Calibration and Shapley-optimized Equilibrium framework, which enhances collaboration while explicitly mitigating modality competition. PaSE first applies Prototype-guided Calibration Learning (PCL) to refine unimodal representations and align them through an Entropic Optimal Transport mechanism that ensures semantic consistency. To further stabilize optimization, we introduce a Dual-Phase Optimization strategy. A prototype-gated fusion module is first used to extract shared representations, followed by Shapley-based Gradient Modulation (SGM), which adaptively adjusts gradients according to the contribution of each modality. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP, MOSI, and MOSEI confirm that PaSE achieves the superior performance and effectively alleviates modality competition.</description>

      <title>Fluid Grey 2: How Well Does Generative Adversarial Network Learn Deeper Topology Structure in Architecture That Matches Images?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking into account the regional characteristics of intrinsic and extrinsic properties of space is an essential issue in architectural design and urban renewal, which is often achieved step by step using image and graph-based GANs. However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in AI have introduced several strong models in computational pathology to usher it into the era of multi-modal diagnosis, analysis, and interpretation. However, the current pathology-specific visual language models still lack capacities in making diagnosis with rigorous reasoning paths as well as handling divergent tasks, and thus challenges of building AI Copilots for real scenarios still exist. Here we introduce TeamPath, an AI system powered by reinforcement learning and router-enhanced solutions based on large-scale histopathology multimodal datasets, to work as a virtual assistant for expert-level disease diagnosis, patch-level information summarization, and cross-modality generation to integrate transcriptomic information for the clinical usage. We also collaborate with pathologists from Yale School of Medicine to demonstrate that TeamPath can assist them in working more efficiently by identifying and correcting expert conclusions and reasoning paths. Overall, TeamPath can flexibly choose the best settings according to the needs, and serve as an innovative and reliable system for information communication across different modalities and experts.</description>

      <title>CubeletWorld: A New Abstraction for Scalable 3D Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cities produce vast streams of heterogeneous data, from infrastructure maps to mobility logs and satellite imagery. However, integrating these sources into coherent spatial models for planning and prediction remains a major challenge. Existing agent-centric methods often rely on direct environmental sensing, limiting scalability and raising privacy concerns. This paper introduces CubeletWorld, a novel framework for representing and analyzing urban environments through a discretized 3D grid of spatial units called cubelets. This abstraction enables privacy-preserving modeling by embedding diverse data signals, such as infrastructure, movement, or environmental indicators, into localized cubelet states. CubeletWorld supports downstream tasks such as planning, navigation, and occupancy prediction without requiring agent-driven sensing. To evaluate this paradigm, we propose the CubeletWorld State Prediction task, which involves predicting the cubelet state using a realistic dataset containing various urban elements like streets and buildings through this discretized representation. We explore a range of modified core models suitable for our setting and analyze challenges posed by increasing spatial granularity, specifically the issue of sparsity in representation and scalability of baselines. In contrast to existing 3D occupancy prediction models, our cubelet-centric approach focuses on inferring state at the spatial unit level, enabling greater generalizability across regions and improved privacy compliance. Our results demonstrate that CubeletWorld offers a flexible and extensible framework for learning from complex urban data, and it opens up new possibilities for scalable simulation and decision support in domains such as socio-demographic modeling, environmental monitoring, and emergency response.

      <title>DeepCoT: Deep Continual Transformers for Real-Time Inference on Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have dramatically increased their size and parameter count to tackle increasingly complex tasks. At the same time, there is a growing demand for low-latency inference on resource-constrained devices that achieves high performance. In particular, stream data inference is typically performed over a sliding temporal window, leading to highly redundant computations. The recent Continual Transformers have addressed this issue, but they can only be effectively used in shallow models, which limits their scope and generalization power. In this paper, we propose the Deep Continual Transformer (DeepCoT), a redundancy-free encoder-only model that can be applied over existing deep encoder architectures with minimal changes. In our experiments over audio, video, and text streams, we show that DeepCoTs retain comparative performance to their non-continual baselines while offering a linear computational cost for all Transformer layers, which reduces up to two orders of magnitude in the running time compared to previous efficient models.</description>

      <title>Robust Detection of Retinal Neovascularization in Widefield Optical Coherence Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is a vision threatening development in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Vision loss associated with RNV is preventable with timely intervention, making RNV clinical screening and monitoring a priority. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) provides high-resolution imaging and high-sensitivity detection of RNV lesions. With recent commercial devices introducing widefield OCTA imaging to the clinic, the technology stands to improve early detection of RNV pathology. However, to meet clinical requirements these imaging capabilities must be combined with effective RNV detection and quantification, but existing algorithms for OCTA images are optimized for conventional, i.e. narrow, fields of view. Here, we present a novel approach for RNV diagnosis and staging on widefield OCT/OCTA. Unlike conventional methods dependent on multi-layer retinal segmentation, our model reframes RNV identification as a direct binary localization task. Our fully automated approach was trained and validated on 589 widefield scans (17x17-mm to 26x21-mm) collected from multiple devices at multiple clinics. Our method achieved a device-dependent area under curve (AUC) ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 for RNV diagnosis, and mean intersection over union (IOU) ranging from 0.76 to 0.88 for segmentation. We also demonstrate our method's ability to monitor lesion growth longitudinally. Our results indicate that deep learning-based analysis for widefield OCTA images could offer a valuable means for improving RNV screening and management.</description>

      <title>MobileVLA-R1: Reinforcing Vision-Language-Action for Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grounding natural-language instructions into continuous control for quadruped robots remains a fundamental challenge in vision language action. Existing methods struggle to bridge high-level semantic reasoning and low-level actuation, leading to unstable grounding and weak generalization in the real world. To address these issues, we present MobileVLA-R1, a unified vision-language-action framework that enables explicit reasoning and continuous control for quadruped robots. We construct MobileVLA-CoT, a large-scale dataset of multi-granularity chain-of-thought (CoT) for embodied trajectories, providing structured reasoning supervision for alignment. Built upon this foundation, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm that combines supervised CoT alignment with GRPO reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning consistency, control stability, and long-horizon execution. Extensive evaluations on VLN and VLA tasks demonstrate superior performance over strong baselines, with approximately a 5% improvement. Real-world deployment on a quadruped robot validates robust performance in complex environments. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MobileVLA-R1.

      <title>Spectral Super-Resolution Neural Operator with Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral super-resolution (SSR) aims to reconstruct hyperspectral images (HSIs) from multispectral observations, with broad applications in remote sensing. Data-driven methods are widely used, but they often overlook physical principles, leading to unrealistic spectra, particularly in atmosphere-affected bands. To address this challenge, we propose the Spectral Super-Resolution Neural Operator (SSRNO), which incorporates atmospheric radiative transfer (ART) prior into the data-driven procedure, yielding more physically consistent predictions. The proposed SSRNO framework consists of three stages: upsampling, reconstruction, and refinement. In the upsampling stage, we leverage prior information to expand the input multispectral image, producing a physically plausible hyperspectral estimate. Subsequently, we utilize a neural operator in the reconstruction stage to learn a continuous mapping across the spectral domain. Finally, the refinement stage imposes a hard constraint on the output HSI to eliminate color distortion. The upsampling and refinement stages are implemented via the proposed guidance matrix projection (GMP) method, and the reconstruction neural operator adopts U-shaped spectral-aware convolution (SAC) layers to capture multi-scale features. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate the optimality of the GMP method. With the neural operator and ART priors, SSRNO also achieves continuous spectral reconstruction and zero-shot extrapolation. Various experiments validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Animated Territorial Data Extractor (ATDE): A Computer-Vision Method for Extracting Territorial Data from Animated Historical Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Animated Territorial Data Extractor (ATDE), a computer vision tool that extracts quantitative territorial data from animated historical map videos. ATDE employs HSV-based color segmentation, RGB channel filtering, and Direct-Neighbor Filtering to identify and count pixels representing territorial control. Combined with preprocessing for temporal alignment and cross-video scaling, the pipeline converts animated videos into structured time-series data. We demonstrate the tool on ten Chinese dynasties (200 BCE - 1912 CE), producing year-by-year pixel counts that align with expected historical patterns. While not a substitute for authoritative historical datasets, ATDE is well-suited for educational demonstrations, preliminary data exploration, and comparative analysis of territorial dynamics. The tool requires no pre-existing shapefiles and can be applied to any animated map video given seed colors and basic configuration. Code and examples are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Switch-JustDance: Benchmarking Whole Body Motion Tracking Policies Using a Commercial Console Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in whole-body robot control have enabled humanoid and legged robots to perform increasingly agile and coordinated motions. However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating these capabilities in real-world settings, and in direct comparison to humans, remain scarce. Existing evaluations often rely on pre-collected human motion datasets or simulation-based experiments, which limit reproducibility, overlook hardware factors, and hinder fair human-robot comparisons. We present Switch-JustDance, a low-cost and reproducible benchmarking pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games, Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch, to evaluate robot whole-body control. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative platform, Switch-JustDance converts in-game choreography into robot-executable motions through streaming, motion reconstruction, and motion retargeting modules and enables users to evaluate controller performance through the game's built-in scoring system. We first validate the evaluation properties of Just Dance, analyzing its reliability, validity, sensitivity, and potential sources of bias. Our results show that the platform provides consistent and interpretable performance measures, making it a suitable tool for benchmarking embodied AI. Building on this foundation, we benchmark three state-of-the-art humanoid whole-body controllers on hardware and provide insights into their relative strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>pFedBBN: A Personalized Federated Test-Time Adaptation with Balanced Batch Normalization for Class-Imbalanced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) in federated learning (FL) is crucial for handling unseen data distributions across clients, particularly when faced with domain shifts and skewed class distributions. Class Imbalance (CI) remains a fundamental challenge in FL, where rare but critical classes are often severely underrepresented in individual client datasets. Although prior work has addressed CI during training through reliable aggregation and local class distribution alignment, these methods typically rely on access to labeled data or coordination among clients, and none address class unsupervised adaptation to dynamic domains or distribution shifts at inference time under federated CI constraints. Revealing the failure of state-of-the-art TTA in federated client adaptation in CI scenario, we propose pFedBBN,a personalized federated test-time adaptation framework that employs balanced batch normalization (BBN) during local client adaptation to mitigate prediction bias by treating all classes equally, while also enabling client collaboration guided by BBN similarity, ensuring that clients with similar balanced representations reinforce each other and that adaptation remains aligned with domain-specific characteristics. pFedBBN supports fully unsupervised local adaptation and introduces a class-aware model aggregation strategy that enables personalized inference without compromising privacy. It addresses both distribution shifts and class imbalance through balanced feature normalization and domain-aware collaboration, without requiring any labeled or raw data from clients. Extensive experiments across diverse baselines show that pFedBBN consistently enhances robustness and minority-class performance over state-of-the-art FL and TTA methods.</description>

      <title>Observer Actor: Active Vision Imitation Learning with Sparse View Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Observer Actor (ObAct), a novel framework for active vision imitation learning in which the observer moves to optimal visual observations for the actor. We study ObAct on a dual-arm robotic system equipped with wrist-mounted cameras. At test time, ObAct dynamically assigns observer and actor roles: the observer arm constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation from three images, virtually explores this to find an optimal camera pose, then moves to this pose; the actor arm then executes a policy using the observer's observations. This formulation enhances the clarity and visibility of both the object and the gripper in the policy's observations. As a result, we enable the training of ambidextrous policies on observations that remain closer to the occlusion-free training distribution, leading to more robust policies. We study this formulation with two existing imitation learning methods -- trajectory transfer and behavior cloning -- and experiments show that ObAct significantly outperforms static-camera setups: trajectory transfer improves by 145% without occlusion and 233% with occlusion, while behavior cloning improves by 75% and 143%, respectively.

      <title>AVERY: Adaptive VLM Split Computing through Embodied Self-Awareness for Efficient Disaster Response Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in disaster response require complex, queryable intelligence that on-board CNNs cannot provide. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution "context stream" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity "insight stream" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper evaluates Tucker decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for compressing neuroimaging data. Tucker decomposition preserves multi-dimensional relationships, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity and perceptual similarity. SVD excels in extreme compression but sacrifices fidelity.

      <title>Coherent Multi-Agent Trajectory Forecasting in Team Sports with CausalTraj</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jointly forecasting trajectories of multiple interacting agents is a core challenge in sports analytics and other domains involving complex group dynamics. Accurate prediction enables realistic simulation and strategic understanding of gameplay evolution. Most existing models are evaluated solely on per-agent accuracy metrics (minADE, minFDE), which assess each agent independently on its best-of-k prediction. However these metrics overlook whether the model learns which predicted trajectories can jointly form a plausible multi-agent future. Many state-of-the-art models are designed and optimized primarily based on these metrics. As a result, they may underperform on joint predictions and also fail to generate coherent, interpretable multi-agent scenarios in team sports. We propose CausalTraj, a temporally causal, likelihood-based model that is built to generate jointly probable multi-agent trajectory forecasts. To better assess collective modeling capability, we emphasize joint metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) that measure joint accuracy across agents within the best generated scenario sample. Evaluated on the NBA SportVU, Basketball-U, and Football-U datasets, CausalTraj achieves competitive per-agent accuracy and the best recorded results on joint metrics, while yielding qualitatively coherent and realistic gameplay evolutions.</description>

      <title>From Tables to Signals: Revealing Spectral Adaptivity in TabPFN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-agnostic tabular foundation models such as TabPFN have achieved impressive performance on tabular learning tasks, yet the origins of their inductive biases remain poorly understood. In this work, we study TabPFN through the lens of signal reconstruction and provide the first frequency-based analysis of its in-context learning behavior. We show that TabPFN possesses a broader effective frequency capacity than standard ReLU-MLPs, even without hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, unlike MLPs whose spectra evolve primarily over training epochs, we find that TabPFN's spectral capacity adapts directly to the number of samples provided in-context, a phenomenon we term Spectral Adaptivity. We further demonstrate that positional encoding modulates TabPFN's frequency response, mirroring classical results in implicit neural representations. Finally, we show that these properties enable TabPFN to perform training-free and hyperparameter-free image denoising, illustrating its potential as a task-agnostic implicit model. Our analysis provides new insight into the structure and inductive biases of tabular foundation models and highlights their promise for broader signal reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>TRIDENT: A Trimodal Cascade Generative Framework for Drug and RNA-Conditioned Cellular Morphology Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the relationship between perturbations, transcriptional responses, and phenotypic changes is essential for building an AI Virtual Cell (AIVC). However, existing methods typically constrained to modeling direct associations, such as Perturbation $\rightarrow$ RNA or Perturbation $\rightarrow$ Morphology, overlook the crucial causal link from RNA to morphology. To bridge this gap, we propose TRIDENT, a cascade generative framework that synthesizes realistic cellular morphology by conditioning on both the perturbation and the corresponding gene expression profile. To train and evaluate this task, we construct MorphoGene, a new dataset pairing L1000 gene expression with Cell Painting images for 98 compounds. TRIDENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 7-fold improvement with strong generalization to unseen compounds. In a case study on docetaxel, we validate that RNA-guided synthesis accurately produces the corresponding phenotype. An ablation study further confirms that this RNA conditioning is essential for the model's high fidelity. By explicitly modeling transcriptome-phenome mapping, TRIDENT provides a powerful in silico tool and moves us closer to a predictive virtual cell.</description>

      <title>Learning Visually Interpretable Oscillator Networks for Soft Continuum Robots from Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven learning of soft continuum robot (SCR) dynamics from high-dimensional observations offers flexibility but often lacks physical interpretability, while model-based approaches require prior knowledge and can be computationally expensive. We bridge this gap by introducing (1) the Attention Broadcast Decoder (ABCD), a plug-and-play module for autoencoder-based latent dynamics learning that generates pixel-accurate attention maps localizing each latent dimension's contribution while filtering static backgrounds. (2) By coupling these attention maps to 2D oscillator networks, we enable direct on-image visualization of learned dynamics (masses, stiffness, and forces) without prior knowledge. We validate our approach on single- and double-segment SCRs, demonstrating that ABCD-based models significantly improve multi-step prediction accuracy: 5.7x error reduction for Koopman operators and 3.5x for oscillator networks on the two-segment robot. The learned oscillator network autonomously discovers a chain structure of oscillators. Unlike standard methods, ABCD models enable smooth latent space extrapolation beyond training data. This fully data-driven approach yields compact, physically interpretable models suitable for control applications.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Gene Learning: Spatial Gene Expression Estimation by Auxiliary Gene Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a novel technology that enables the observation of gene expression at the resolution of individual spots within pathological tissues. ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \ Gene \ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.</description>

Abstract: Search and rescue missions are often critical following sudden natural disasters or in high-risk environmental situations. The most challenging search and rescue missions involve difficult-to-access terrains, such as dense forests with high occlusion. Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles for exploration can significantly enhance search effectiveness, facilitate access to challenging environments, and reduce search time. However, in dense forests, the effectiveness of unmanned aerial vehicles depends on their ability to capture clear views of the ground, necessitating a robust search strategy to optimize camera positioning and perspective. This work presents an optimized planning strategy and an efficient algorithm for the next best view problem in occluded environments. Two novel optimization heuristics, a geometry heuristic, and a visibility heuristic, are proposed to enhance search performance by selecting optimal camera viewpoints. Comparative evaluations in both simulated and real-world settings reveal that the visibility heuristic achieves greater performance, identifying over 90% of hidden objects in simulated forests and offering 10% better detection rates than the geometry heuristic. Additionally, real-world experiments demonstrate that the visibility heuristic provides better coverage under the canopy, highlighting its potential for improving search and rescue missions in occluded environments.</description>

      <title>Self-Empowering VLMs: Achieving Hierarchical Consistency via Self-Elicited Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) possess rich knowledge but often fail on hierarchical understanding tasks, where the goal is to predict a coarse-to-fine taxonomy path that remains consistent across all levels. We compare three inference paradigms for hierarchical VQA and find that stepwise reasoning, when conditioned on prior answers, significantly outperforms single-pass prompting. Further analysis indicates that the main limitation of current VLMs is their inability to maintain cross-level state, rather than a lack of taxonomic knowledge. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose Self-Elicited Knowledge Distillation (SEKD), which requires no human labels or external tools: the same VLM is prompted to reason step by step and act as a teacher by exposing its hard labels, soft distributions, and decoder hidden states, while a single-pass student distills these signals. The student VLM remains efficient while approaching the accuracy of its multi-step teacher. It improves in-domain path consistency (HCA) by up to +29.50 percentage points, raises zero-shot HCA on an unseen taxonomy from 4.15% to 42.26%, and yields gains on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Because all supervision is self-elicited, SEKD scales to new taxonomies and datasets without annotation cost, providing a practical route to imbue compact VLMs with dependency-aware multi-step reasoning.</description>

      <title>Categorical Equivariant Deep Learning: Category-Equivariant Neural Networks and Universal Approximation Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of category-equivariant neural networks (CENNs) that unifies group/groupoid-equivariant networks, poset/lattice-equivariant networks, graph and sheaf neural networks. Equivariance is formulated as naturality in a topological category with Radon measures, formulating linear and nonlinear layers in the categorical setup. We prove the equivariant universal approximation theorem in the general setting: the class of finite-depth CENNs is dense in the space of continuous equivariant transformations. We instantiate the framework for groups/groupoids, posets/lattices, graphs and cellular sheaves, deriving universal approximation theorems for them in a systematic manner. Categorical equivariant deep learning thus allows us to expand the horizons of equivariant deep learning beyond group actions, encompassing not only geometric symmetries but also contextual and compositional symmetries.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Preserving Selective Imaging for Pediatric Hip Dysplasia: A Cross-Modal Ultrasound-Xray Policy with Limited Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an ultrasound-first, radiation-preserving policy for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) that requests a radiograph only when needed.
  We (i) pretrain modality-specific encoders (ResNet-18) with SimSiam on a large unlabelled registry (37186 ultrasound; 19546 radiographs), (ii) freeze the backbones and fit small, measurement-faithful heads on DDH relevant landmarks and measurements (iii) calibrate a one sided conformal deferral rule on ultrasound predictions that provides finite sample coverage guarantees under exchangeability, using a held-out calibration set. Ultrasound heads predict Graf alpha, beta, and femoral head coverage; X-ray heads predict acetabular index (AI), center-edge (CE) angle and IHDI grade. On our held out labeled evaluation set, ultrasound measurement error is modest (e.g., alpha MAE ~= 9.7 degrees, coverage MAE ~= 14.0%), while radiographic probes achieve AI and CE MAEs of ~= 7.6 degrees and ~= 8.9 degrees, respectively. The calibrated US-only policy is explored across rule families (alpha-only; alpha OR coverage; alpha AND coverage), uncertainty inflation factors, and per-utility trade-offs using decision-curve analysis. Conservative settings yield high coverage with near-zero US-only rates; permissive settings (e.g., alpha OR coverage at larger deltas) achieve non-zero US-only throughput with expected coverage tradeoffs. The result is a simple, reproducible pipeline that turns limited labels into interpretable measurements and tunable selective imaging curves suitable for clinical handoff and future external validation.</description>

      <title>SloMo-Fast: Slow-Momentum and Fast-Adaptive Teachers for Source-Free Continual Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is crucial for deploying models in real-world applications with unseen, evolving target domains. Existing CTTA methods, however, often rely on source data or prototypes, limiting their applicability in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings. Additionally, these methods suffer from long-term forgetting, which degrades performance on previously encountered domains as target domains shift. To address these challenges, we propose SloMo-Fast, a source-free, dual-teacher CTTA framework designed for enhanced adaptability and generalization. It includes two complementary teachers: the Slow-Teacher, which exhibits slow forgetting and retains long-term knowledge of previously encountered domains to ensure robust generalization, and the Fast-Teacher rapidly adapts to new domains while accumulating and integrating knowledge across them. This framework preserves knowledge of past domains and adapts efficiently to new ones. We also introduce Cyclic Test-Time Adaptation (Cyclic-TTA), a novel CTTA benchmark that simulates recurring domain shifts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SloMo-Fast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Cyclic-TTA, as well as ten other CTTA settings, highlighting its ability to both adapt and generalize across evolving and revisited domains.</description>

      <title>Shape-Adapting Gated Experts: Dynamic Expert Routing for Colonoscopic Lesion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The substantial diversity in cell scale and form remains a primary challenge in computer-aided cancer detection on gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs), attributable to cellular heterogeneity. Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids rely on static computation graphs with fixed routing, which consequently causes redundant computation and limits their adaptability to input variability. We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context. SAGE provides a scalable foundation for dynamic expert routing, enabling flexible visual reasoning.</description>

      <title>TimePre: Bridging Accuracy, Efficiency, and Stability in Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting (PTSF) is critical for uncertainty-aware decision making, but existing generative models, such as diffusion-based approaches, are computationally prohibitive due to expensive iterative sampling. Non-sampling frameworks like Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) offer an efficient alternative, but suffer from severe training instability and hypothesis collapse, which has historically hindered their performance. This problem is dramatically exacerbated when attempting to combine them with modern, efficient MLP-based backbones. To resolve this fundamental incompatibility, we propose TimePre, a novel framework that successfully unifies the efficiency of MLP-based models with the distributional flexibility of the MCL paradigm. The core of our solution is Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN), a novel normalization layer that explicitly remedies this incompatibility. SIN stabilizes the hybrid architecture by correcting channel-wise statistical shifts, definitively resolving the catastrophic hypothesis collapse. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimePre achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on key probabilistic metrics. Critically, TimePre achieves inference speeds orders of magnitude faster than sampling-based models and, unlike prior MCL work, demonstrates stable performance scaling. It thus bridges the long-standing gap between accuracy, efficiency, and stability in probabilistic forecasting.</description>

      <title>AutoFocus-IL: VLM-based Saliency Maps for Data-Efficient Visual Imitation Learning without Extra Human Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AutoFocus-IL is a simple yet effective method to improve data efficiency and generalization in visual imitation learning by guiding policies to attend to task-relevant features rather than distractors and spurious correlations. Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data. Code, datasets, and trained policy videos are available at https://AutoFocus-IL.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replacing modules in pretrained models, especially swapping quadratic self-attention for efficient attention alternatives, poses a hard optimization problem: cold-start reinitialization destabilizes frozen backbones. We isolate this core stability challenge in a controlled study. Deterministic Continuous Replacement (DCR) blends teacher and student outputs with a deterministic, annealed weight. Theoretically, DCR eliminates gate-induced gradient variance inherent to stochastic replacement. In a single-seed study, DCR attains faster convergence and stronger alignment than stochastic gating and distillation baselines on controlled attention replacement, establishing a foundation for heterogeneous operator swaps.</description>

      <title>Inverse Rendering for High-Genus Surface Meshes from Multi-View Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a topology-informed inverse rendering approach for reconstructing high-genus surface meshes from multi-view images. Compared to 3D representations like voxels and point clouds, mesh-based representations are preferred as they enable the application of differential geometry theory and are optimized for modern graphics pipelines. However, existing inverse rendering methods often fail catastrophically on high-genus surfaces, leading to the loss of key topological features, and tend to oversmooth low-genus surfaces, resulting in the loss of surface details. This failure stems from their overreliance on Adam-based optimizers, which can lead to vanishing and exploding gradients. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an adaptive V-cycle remeshing scheme in conjunction with a re-parametrized Adam optimizer to enhance topological and geometric awareness. By periodically coarsening and refining the deforming mesh, our method informs mesh vertices of their current topology and geometry before optimization, mitigating gradient issues while preserving essential topological features. Additionally, we enforce topological consistency by constructing topological primitives with genus numbers that match those of ground truth using Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Experimental results demonstrate that our inverse rendering approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, achieving significant improvements in Chamfer Distance and Volume IoU, particularly for high-genus surfaces, while also enhancing surface details for low-genus surfaces.</description>

      <title>VLM in a flash: I/O-Efficient Sparsification of Vision-Language Model via Neuron Chunking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge deployment of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) increasingly relies on flash-based weight offloading, where activation sparsification is used to reduce I/O overhead. However, conventional sparsification remains model-centric, selecting neurons solely by activation magnitude and neglecting how access patterns influence flash performance. We present Neuron Chunking, an I/O-efficient sparsification strategy that operates on chunks (i.e., groups of contiguous neurons in memory) and couples neuron importance with storage access cost. The method models I/O latency through a lightweight abstraction of access contiguity and selects chunks with high utility, defined as neuron importance normalized by estimated latency. By aligning sparsification decisions with the underlying storage behavior, Neuron Chunking improves I/O efficiency by up to 4.65x and 5.76x on Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson AGX Orin, respectively.</description>

      <title>Stable Multi-Drone GNSS Tracking System for Marine Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate localization is essential for marine robotics, yet Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are unreliable or unavailable even at a very short distance below the water surface. Traditional alternatives, such as inertial navigation, Doppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM, and acoustic methods, suffer from error accumulation, high computational demands, or infrastructure dependence. In this work, we present a scalable multi-drone GNSS-based tracking system for surface and near-surface marine robots. Our approach combines efficient visual detection, lightweight multi-object tracking, GNSS-based triangulation, and a confidence-weighted Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to provide stable GNSS estimation in real time. We further introduce a cross-drone tracking ID alignment algorithm that enforces global consistency across views, enabling robust multi-robot tracking with redundant aerial coverage. We validate our system in diversified complex settings to show the scalability and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and evolution of a comprehensive multimodal room-monitoring system that integrates synchronized video and audio processing for real-time activity recognition and anomaly detection. We describe two iterations of the system: an initial lightweight implementation using YOLOv8, ByteTrack, and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and an advanced version that incorporates multi-model audio ensembles, hybrid object detection, bidirectional cross-modal attention, and multi-method anomaly detection. The evolution demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and industrial applicability. The advanced system combines three audio models (AST, Wav2Vec2, and HuBERT) for comprehensive audio understanding, dual object detectors (YOLO and DETR) for improved accuracy, and sophisticated fusion mechanisms for enhanced cross-modal learning. Experimental evaluation shows the system's effectiveness in general monitoring scenarios as well as specialized industrial safety applications, achieving real-time performance on standard hardware while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

      <title>CNN-Based Camera Pose Estimation and Localisation of Scan Images for Aircraft Visual Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Visual Inspection is a manual inspection process regularly used to detect and localise obvious damage on the exterior of commercial aircraft. There has been increasing demand to perform this process at the boarding gate to minimise the downtime of the aircraft and automating this process is desired to reduce the reliance on human labour. Automating this typically requires estimating a camera's pose with respect to the aircraft for initialisation but most existing localisation methods require infrastructure, which is very challenging in uncontrolled outdoor environments and within the limited turnover time (approximately 2 hours) on an airport tarmac. Additionally, many airlines and airports do not allow contact with the aircraft's surface or using UAVs for inspection between flights, and restrict access to commercial aircraft. Hence, this paper proposes an on-site method that is infrastructure-free and easy to deploy for estimating a pan-tilt-zoom camera's pose and localising scan images. This method initialises using the same pan-tilt-zoom camera used for the inspection task by utilising a Deep Convolutional Neural Network fine-tuned on only synthetic images to predict its own pose. We apply domain randomisation to generate the dataset for fine-tuning the network and modify its loss function by leveraging aircraft geometry to improve accuracy. We also propose a workflow for initialisation, scan path planning, and precise localisation of images captured from a pan-tilt-zoom camera. We evaluate and demonstrate our approach through experiments with real aircraft, achieving root-mean-square camera pose estimation errors of less than 0.24 m and 2 degrees for all real scenes.</description>

      <title>GRIT-LP: Graph Transformer with Long-Range Skip Connection and Partitioned Spatial Graphs for Accurate Ice Layer Thickness Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph transformers have demonstrated remarkable capability on complex spatio-temporal tasks, yet their depth is often limited by oversmoothing and weak long-range dependency modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce GRIT-LP, a graph transformer explicitly designed for polar ice-layer thickness estimation from polar radar imagery. Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate patterns and reducing uncertainties in projections of future ice sheet evolution and sea level rise. GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with self-attention mechanism, and introduces two major innovations that jointly address challenges in modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of ice layers: a partitioned spatial graph construction strategy that forms overlapping, fully connected local neighborhoods to preserve spatial coherence and suppress noise from irrelevant long-range links, and a long-range skip connection mechanism within the transformer that improves information flow and mitigates oversmoothing in deeper attention layers. We conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that GRIT-LP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92\% improvement in root mean squared error. These results highlight the effectiveness of graph transformers in modeling spatiotemporal patterns by capturing both localized structural features and long-range dependencies across internal ice layers, and demonstrate their potential to advance data-driven understanding of cryospheric processes.</description>

      <title>Neural B-Frame Coding: Tackling Domain Shift Issues with Lightweight Online Motion Resolution Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learned B-frame codecs with hierarchical temporal prediction often encounter the domain-shift issue due to mismatches between the Group-of-Pictures (GOP) sizes for training and testing, leading to inaccurate motion estimates, particularly for large motion. A common solution is to turn large motion into small motion by downsampling video frames during motion estimation. However, determining the optimal downsampling factor typically requires costly rate-distortion optimization. This work introduces lightweight classifiers to predict downsampling factors. These classifiers leverage simple state signals from current and reference frames to balance rate-distortion performance with computational cost. Three variants are proposed: (1) a binary classifier (Bi-Class) trained with Focal Loss to choose between high and low resolutions, (2) a multi-class classifier (Mu-Class) trained with novel soft labels based on rate-distortion costs, and (3) a co-class approach (Co-Class) that combines the predictive capability of the multi-class classifier with the selective search of the binary classifier. All classifier methods can work seamlessly with existing B-frame codecs without requiring codec retraining. Experimental results show that they achieve coding performance comparable to exhaustive search methods while significantly reducing computational complexity.

      <title>Sampling Control for Imbalanced Calibration in Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in semi-supervised learning (SSL), especially when distributional mismatches between labeled and unlabeled data lead to biased classification. Although existing methods address this issue by adjusting logits based on the estimated class distribution of unlabeled data, they often handle model imbalance in a coarse-grained manner, conflating data imbalance with bias arising from varying class-specific learning difficulties. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework, SC-SSL, which suppresses model bias through decoupled sampling control. During training, we identify the key variables for sampling control under ideal conditions. By introducing a classifier with explicit expansion capability and adaptively adjusting sampling probabilities across different data distributions, SC-SSL mitigates feature-level imbalance for minority classes. In the inference phase, we further analyze the weight imbalance of the linear classifier and apply post-hoc sampling control with an optimization bias vector to directly calibrate the logits. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets and distribution settings validate the consistency and state-of-the-art performance of SC-SSL.</description>

      <title>ChronoGS: Disentangling Invariants and Changes in Multi-Period Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-period image collections are common in real-world applications. Cities are re-scanned for mapping, construction sites are revisited for progress tracking, and natural regions are monitored for environmental change. Such data form multi-period scenes, where geometry and appearance evolve. Reconstructing such scenes is an important yet underexplored problem. Existing pipelines rely on incompatible assumptions: static and in-the-wild methods enforce a single geometry, while dynamic ones assume smooth motion, both failing under long-term, discontinuous changes. To solve this problem, we introduce ChronoGS, a temporally modulated Gaussian representation that reconstructs all periods within a unified anchor scaffold. It's also designed to disentangle stable and evolving components, achieving temporally consistent reconstruction of multi-period scenes. To catalyze relevant research, we release ChronoScene dataset, a benchmark of real and synthetic multi-period scenes, capturing geometric and appearance variation. Experiments demonstrate that ChronoGS consistently outperforms baselines in reconstruction quality and temporal consistency. Our code and the ChronoScene dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/ZhongtaoWang/ChronoGS.</description>

      <title>PrismAudio: Decomposed Chain-of-Thoughts and Multi-dimensional Rewards for Video-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation requires balancing four critical perceptual dimensions: semantic consistency, audio-visual temporal synchrony, aesthetic quality, and spatial accuracy; yet existing methods suffer from objective entanglement that conflates competing goals in single loss functions and lack human preference alignment. We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.

      <title>Robust and Generalizable GNN Fine-Tuning via Uncertainty-aware Adapter Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained GNNs has yielded remarkable attention in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream graph learning tasks. One representative fine-tuning method is to exploit adapter (termed AdapterGNN) which aims to 'augment' the pre-trained model by inserting a lightweight module to make the 'augmented' model better adapt to the downstream tasks. However, graph data may contain various types of noise in downstream tasks, such as noisy edges and ambiguous node attributes. Existing AdapterGNNs are often prone to graph noise and exhibit limited generalizability. How to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of GNNs' fine tuning remains an open problem. In this paper, we show that the above problem can be well addressed by integrating uncertainty learning into the GNN adapter. We propose the Uncertainty-aware Adapter (UAdapterGNN) that fortifies pre-trained GNN models against noisy graph data in the fine-tuning process. Specifically, in contrast to regular AdapterGNN, our UAdapterGNN exploits Gaussian probabilistic adapter to augment the pre-trained GNN model. In this way, when the graph contains various noises,our method can automatically absorb the effects of changes in the variances of the Gaussian distribution, thereby significantly enhancing the model's robustness. Also, UAdapterGNN can further improve the generalization ability of the model on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and high generalization ability of the proposed UAdapterGNN method.</description>

      <title>GContextFormer: A global context-aware hybrid multi-head attention approach with scaled additive aggregation for multimodal trajectory prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal trajectory prediction generates multiple plausible future trajectories to address vehicle motion uncertainty from intention ambiguity and execution variability. However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying diffusion models to physically-based material estimation and generation has recently gained prominence. In this paper, we propose \ttt, a novel material reconstruction framework for 3D objects, offering the following advantages. First, \ttt\ adopts a two-stage reconstruction, starting with accurate material prediction from inputs and followed by prior-guided material generation for unobserved views, yielding high-fidelity results. Second, by utilizing progressive inference alongside the proposed view-material cross-attention (VMCA), \ttt\ enables reconstruction from an arbitrary number of input images, demonstrating strong scalability and flexibility. Finally, \ttt\ achieves both material prediction and generation capabilities through end-to-end optimization of a single diffusion model, without relying on additional pre-trained models, thereby exhibiting enhanced stability across various types of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ttt\ achieves superior performance in material reconstruction compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Compressor-VLA: Instruction-Guided Visual Token Compression for Efficient Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in Embodied AI. However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>AVA-VLA: Improving Vision-Language-Action models with Active Visual Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in embodied AI tasks. However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizable Deepfake Detection via Forgery-aware Audio-Visual Adaptation: A Variational Bayesian Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread application of AIGC contents has brought not only unprecedented opportunities, but also potential security concerns, e.g., audio-visual deepfakes. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop an effective and generalizable method for multi-modal deepfake detection. Typically, the audio-visual correlation learning could expose subtle cross-modal inconsistencies, e.g., audio-visual misalignment, which serve as crucial clues in deepfake detection. In this paper, we reformulate the correlation learning with variational Bayesian estimation, where audio-visual correlation is approximated as a Gaussian distributed latent variable, and thus develop a novel framework for deepfake detection, i.e., Forgery-aware Audio-Visual Adaptation with Variational Bayes (FoVB). Specifically, given the prior knowledge of pre-trained backbones, we adopt two core designs to estimate audio-visual correlations effectively. First, we exploit various difference convolutions and a high-pass filter to discern local and global forgery traces from both modalities. Second, with the extracted forgery-aware features, we estimate the latent Gaussian variable of audio-visual correlation via variational Bayes. Then, we factorize the variable into modality-specific and correlation-specific ones with orthogonality constraint, allowing them to better learn intra-modal and cross-modal forgery traces with less entanglement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FoVB outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FedPoisonTTP: A Threat Model and Poisoning Attack for Federated Test-Time Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time personalization in federated learning enables models at clients to adjust online to local domain shifts, enhancing robustness and personalization in deployment. Yet, existing federated learning work largely overlooks the security risks that arise when local adaptation occurs at test time. Heterogeneous domain arrivals, diverse adaptation algorithms, and limited cross-client visibility create vulnerabilities where compromised participants can craft poisoned inputs and submit adversarial updates that undermine both global and per-client performance. To address this threat, we introduce FedPoisonTTP, a realistic grey-box attack framework that explores test-time data poisoning in the federated adaptation setting. FedPoisonTTP distills a surrogate model from adversarial queries, synthesizes in-distribution poisons using feature-consistency, and optimizes attack objectives to generate high-entropy or class-confident poisons that evade common adaptation filters. These poisons are injected during local adaptation and spread through collaborative updates, leading to broad degradation. Extensive experiments on corrupted vision benchmarks show that compromised participants can substantially diminish overall test-time performance.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Object Tracking with On-Device Deep Learning for Adaptive Beamforming in Dynamic Acoustic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in object tracking and acoustic beamforming are driving new capabilities in surveillance, human-computer interaction, and robotics. This work presents an embedded system that integrates deep learning-based tracking with beamforming to achieve precise sound source localization and directional audio capture in dynamic environments. The approach combines single-camera depth estimation and stereo vision to enable accurate 3D localization of moving objects. A planar concentric circular microphone array constructed with MEMS microphones provides a compact, energy-efficient platform supporting 2D beam steering across azimuth and elevation. Real-time tracking outputs continuously adapt the array's focus, synchronizing the acoustic response with the target's position. By uniting learned spatial awareness with dynamic steering, the system maintains robust performance in the presence of multiple or moving sources. Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant gains in signal-to-interference ratio, making the design well-suited for teleconferencing, smart home devices, and assistive technologies.</description>

      <title>UniGame: Turning a Unified Multimodal Model Into Its Own Adversary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown impressive performance in both understanding and generation with a single architecture. However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

      <title>Flow Map Distillation Without Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art flow models achieve remarkable quality but require slow, iterative sampling. To accelerate this, flow maps can be distilled from pre-trained teachers, a procedure that conventionally requires sampling from an external dataset. We argue that this data-dependency introduces a fundamental risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, as a static dataset may provide an incomplete or even misaligned representation of the teacher's full generative capabilities. This leads us to question whether this reliance on data is truly necessary for successful flow map distillation. In this work, we explore a data-free alternative that samples only from the prior distribution, a distribution the teacher is guaranteed to follow by construction, thereby circumventing the mismatch risk entirely. To demonstrate the practical viability of this philosophy, we introduce a principled framework that learns to predict the teacher's sampling path while actively correcting for its own compounding errors to ensure high fidelity. Our approach surpasses all data-based counterparts and establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin. Specifically, distilling from SiT-XL/2+REPA, our method reaches an impressive FID of 1.45 on ImageNet 256x256, and 1.49 on ImageNet 512x512, both with only 1 sampling step. We hope our work establishes a more robust paradigm for accelerating generative models and motivates the broader adoption of flow map distillation without data.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Horizons in Action Chunking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation, but their performance is sensitive to the $\textbf{action chunk length}$ used during training, termed $\textbf{horizon}$. Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $\pi_{\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $\pi_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

      <title>The Shape of Sight: A Homological Framework for Unifying Visual Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.04723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual perception, the brain's construction of a stable world from sensory data, faces several long-standing, fundamental challenges. While often studied separately, these problems have resisted a single, unifying computational framework. In this perspective, we propose a homological framework for visual perception. We argue that the brain's latent representations are governed by their topological parity. This parity interpretation functionally separates homological structures into two distinct classes: 1) Even-dimensional homology ($H_{even}$) acts as static, integrative scaffolds. These structures bind context and content into ``wholes'' or ``what'', serving as the stable, resonant cavities for perceptual objects; 2) Odd-dimensional homology ($H_{odd}$) acts as dynamic, recurrent flows. These structures represent paths, transformations, and self-sustaining ``traces'' or ``where'' that navigate the perceptual landscape. This scaffold-and-flow model is supported by the ventral-dorsal pathway separation and provides a unified solution to three core problems in visual perception. Homological parity hypothesis recasts visual perception not as a linear computation, but as a dynamic interaction between stable, integrative structures and the recurrent, self-sustaining flows that run on them. This perspective offers a new mathematical foundation for linking neural dynamics to perception and cognition.</description>

      <title>K-FACE: A Large-Scale KIST Face Database in Consideration with Unconstrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.02211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new large-scale face database from KIST, denoted as K-FACE, and describe a novel capturing device specifically designed to obtain the data. The K-FACE database contains more than 1 million high-quality images of 1,000 subjects selected by considering the ratio of gender and age groups. It includes a variety of attributes, including 27 poses, 35 lighting conditions, three expressions, and occlusions by the combination of five types of accessories. As the K-FACE database is systematically constructed through a hemispherical capturing system with elaborate lighting control and multiple cameras, it is possible to accurately analyze the effects of factors that cause performance degradation, such as poses, lighting changes, and accessories. We consider not only the balance of external environmental factors, such as pose and lighting, but also the balance of personal characteristics such as gender and age group. The gender ratio is the same, while the age groups of subjects are uniformly distributed from the 20s to 50s for both genders. The K-FACE database can be extensively utilized in various vision tasks, such as face recognition, face frontalization, illumination normalization, face age estimation, and three-dimensional face model generation. We expect systematic diversity and uniformity of the K-FACE database to promote these research fields.</description>

      <title>Multiview point cloud registration with anisotropic and space-varying localization noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of registering multiple point clouds corrupted with high anisotropic localization noise. Our approach follows the widely used framework of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) reconstruction with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Existing methods are based on an implicit assumption of space-invariant isotropic Gaussian noise. However, this assumption is violated in practice in applications such as single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). To address this issue, we propose to introduce an explicit localization noise model that decouples shape modeling with the GMM from noise handling. We design a stochastic EM algorithm that considers noise-free data as a latent variable, with closed-form solutions at each EM step. The first advantage of our approach is to handle space-variant and anisotropic Gaussian noise with arbitrary covariances. The second advantage is to leverage the explicit noise model to impose prior knowledge about the noise that may be available from physical sensors. We show on various simulated data that our noise handling strategy improves significantly the robustness to high levels of anisotropic noise. We also demonstrate the performance of our method on real SMLM data.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network Model for Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting tries to precisely predict the air quality multiple hours ahead for the entire city. This topic is challenged since air pollution varies in a spatiotemporal manner and depends on many complicated factors. Our previous research has solved the problem by considering the whole city as an image and leveraged a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model to learn the spatiotemporal features. However, an image-based representation may not be ideal as air pollution and other impact factors have natural graph structures. In this research, we argue that a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can efficiently represent the spatial features of air quality readings in the whole city. Specially, we extend the ConvLSTM model to a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (Spatiotemporal GCRNN) model by tightly integrating a GCN architecture into an RNN structure for efficient learning spatiotemporal characteristics of air quality values and their influential factors. Our extensive experiments prove the proposed model has a better performance compare to the state-of-the-art ConvLSTM model for air pollution predicting while the number of parameters is much smaller. Moreover, our approach is also superior to a hybrid GCN-based method in a real-world air pollution dataset.</description>

      <title>Prototypical Contrastive Learning-based CLIP Fine-tuning for Object Re-identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to adapt large-scale pre-trained vision-language models, such as contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP), to enhance the performance of object reidentification (Re-ID) across various supervision settings. Although prompt learning has enabled a recent work named CLIP-ReID to achieve promising performance, the underlying mechanisms and the necessity of prompt learning remain unclear due to the absence of semantic labels in ReID tasks. In this work, we first analyze the role prompt learning in CLIP-ReID and identify its limitations. Based on our investigations, we propose a simple yet effective approach to adapt CLIP for supervised object Re-ID. Our approach directly fine-tunes the image encoder of CLIP using a prototypical contrastive learning (PCL) loss, eliminating the need for prompt learning. Experimental results on both person and vehicle Re-ID datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our method compared to CLIP-ReID. Furthermore, we extend our PCL-based CLIP fine-tuning approach to unsupervised scenarios, where we achieve state-of-the art performance.</description>

      <title>Scene Summarization: Clustering Scene Videos into Spatially Diverse Frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans are remarkably efficient at forming spatial understanding from just a few visual observations. When browsing real estate or navigating unfamiliar spaces, they intuitively select a small set of views that summarize the spatial layout. Inspired by this ability, we introduce scene summarization, the task of condensing long, continuous scene videos into a compact set of spatially diverse keyframes that facilitate global spatial reasoning. Unlike conventional video summarization-which focuses on user-edited, fragmented clips and often ignores spatial continuity-our goal is to mimic how humans abstract spatial layout from sparse views. We propose SceneSum, a two-stage self-supervised pipeline that first clusters video frames using visual place recognition to promote spatial diversity, then selects representative keyframes from each cluster under resource constraints. When camera trajectories are available, a lightweight supervised loss further refines clustering and selection. Experiments on real and simulated indoor datasets show that SceneSum produces more spatially informative summaries and outperforms existing video summarization baselines.</description>

      <title>Roadside Monocular 3D Detection Prompted by 2D Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01064v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Roadside monocular 3D detection requires detecting objects of predefined classes in an RGB frame and predicting their 3D attributes, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) locations. It has broad applications in traffic control, vehicle-vehicle communication, and vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. To address this task, we introduce Promptable 3D Detector (Pro3D), a novel detector design that leverages 2D detections as prompts. We build our Pro3D upon two key insights. First, compared to a typical 3D detector, a 2D detector is ``easier'' to train due to fewer loss terms and performs significantly better at localizing objects w.r.t 2D metrics. Second, once 2D detections precisely locate objects in the image, a 3D detector can focus on lifting these detections into 3D BEV, especially when fixed camera pose or scene geometry provide an informative prior. To encode and incorporate 2D detections, we explore three methods: (a) concatenating features from both 2D and 3D detectors, (b) attentively fusing 2D and 3D detector features, and (c) encoding properties of predicted 2D bounding boxes \{$x$, $y$, width, height, label\} and attentively fusing them with the 3D detector feature. Interestingly, the third method significantly outperforms the others, underscoring the effectiveness of 2D detections as prompts that offer precise object targets and allow the 3D detector to focus on lifting them into 3D. Pro3D is adaptable for use with a wide range of 2D and 3D detectors with minimal modifications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our Pro3D significantly enhances existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on two contemporary benchmarks.</description>

      <title>QGait: Toward Accurate Quantization for Gait Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing deep learning methods have made significant progress in gait recognition. Quantization can facilitate the application of gait models as a model-agnostic general compression technique. Typically, appearance-based models binarize inputs into silhouette sequences. However, mainstream quantization methods prioritize minimizing task loss over quantization error, which is detrimental to gait recognition with binarized inputs. To address this, we propose a differentiable soft quantizer, which better simulates the gradient of the round function during backpropagation. This enables the network to learn from subtle input perturbations. However, our theoretical analysis and empirical studies reveal that directly applying the soft quantizer can hinder network convergence. We addressed this issue by adopting a two-stage training strategy, introducing a soft quantizer during the fine-tuning phase. However, in the first stage of training, we observed a significant change in the output distribution of different samples in the feature space compared to the full-precision network. It is this change that led to a loss in performance. Based on this, we propose an Inter-class Distance-guided Calibration (IDC) strategy to preserve the relative distance between the embeddings of samples with different labels. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy across various settings and datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SketchDeco, a training-free approach to sketch colourisation that bridges the gap between professional design needs and intuitive, region-based control. Our method empowers artists to use simple masks and colour palettes for precise spatial and chromatic specification, avoiding both the tediousness of manual assignment and the ambiguity of text-based prompts. We reformulate this task as a novel, training-free composition problem. Our core technical contribution is a guided latent-space blending process: we first leverage diffusion inversion to precisely ``paint'' user-defined colours into specified regions, and then use a custom self-attention mechanism to harmoniously blend these local edits with a globally consistent base image. This ensures both local colour fidelity and global harmony without requiring any model fine-tuning. Our system produces high-quality results in 15--20 inference steps on consumer GPUs, making professional-quality, controllable colourisation accessible.</description>

      <title>GeoReasoner: Geo-localization with Reasoning in Street Views using a Large Vision-Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18572v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work tackles the problem of geo-localization with a new paradigm using a large vision-language model (LVLM) augmented with human inference knowledge. A primary challenge here is the scarcity of data for training the LVLM - existing street-view datasets often contain numerous low-quality images lacking visual clues, and lack any reasoning inference. To address the data-quality issue, we devise a CLIP-based network to quantify the degree of street-view images being locatable, leading to the creation of a new dataset comprising highly locatable street views. To enhance reasoning inference, we integrate external knowledge obtained from real geo-localization games, tapping into valuable human inference capabilities. The data are utilized to train GeoReasoner, which undergoes fine-tuning through dedicated reasoning and location-tuning stages. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate that GeoReasoner outperforms counterpart LVLMs by more than 25% at country-level and 38% at city-level geo-localization tasks, and surpasses StreetCLIP performance while requiring fewer training resources. The data and code are available at https://github.com/lingli1996/GeoReasoner.</description>

      <title>PriorDrive: Enhancing Online HD Mapping with Unified Vector Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-Definition Maps (HD maps) are essential for the precise navigation and decision-making of autonomous vehicles, yet their creation and upkeep present significant cost and timeliness challenges. The online construction of HD maps using on-board sensors has emerged as a promising solution; however, these methods can be impeded by incomplete data due to occlusions and inclement weather, while their performance in distant regions remains unsatisfying. This paper proposes PriorDrive to address these limitations by directly harnessing the power of various vectorized prior maps, significantly enhancing the robustness and accuracy of online HD map construction. Our approach integrates a variety of prior maps uniformly, such as OpenStreetMap's Standard Definition Maps (SD maps), outdated HD maps from vendors, and locally constructed maps from historical vehicle data. To effectively integrate such prior information into online mapping models, we introduce a Hybrid Prior Representation (HPQuery) that standardizes the representation of diverse map elements. We further propose a Unified Vector Encoder (UVE), which employs fused prior embedding and a dual encoding mechanism to encode vector data. To improve the UVE's generalizability and performance, we propose a segment-level and point-level pre-training strategy that enables the UVE to learn the prior distribution of vector data. Through extensive testing on the nuScenes, Argoverse 2 and OpenLane-V2, we demonstrate that PriorDrive is highly compatible with various online mapping models and substantially improves map prediction capabilities. The integration of prior maps through PriorDrive offers a robust solution to the challenges of single-perception data, paving the way for more reliable autonomous vehicle navigation.

      <description>arXiv:2409.08840v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) leverages visual data from connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) to enhance an ego vehicle's field of view (FoV). Despite recent progress, current CP methods expand the ego vehicle's 360-degree perceptual range almost equally, which faces two key challenges. Firstly, in areas with uneven traffic distribution, focusing on directions with little traffic offers limited benefits. Secondly, under limited communication budgets, allocating excessive bandwidth to less critical directions lowers the perception accuracy in more vital areas. To address these issues, we propose Direct-CP, a proactive and direction-aware CP system aiming at improving CP in specific directions. Our key idea is to enable an ego vehicle to proactively signal its interested directions and readjust its attention to enhance local directional CP performance. To achieve this, we first propose an RSU-aided direction masking mechanism that assists an ego vehicle in identifying vital directions. Additionally, we design a direction-aware selective attention module to wisely aggregate pertinent features based on ego vehicle's directional priorities, communication budget, and the positional data of CAVs. Moreover, we introduce a direction-weighted detection loss (DWLoss) to capture the divergence between directional CP outcomes and the ground truth, facilitating effective model training. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Sim 2.0 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 19.8\% higher local perception accuracy in interested directions and 2.5\% higher overall perception accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods in collaborative 3D object detection tasks.

      <title>Improvement of Spiking Neural Network with Bit Planes and Color Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08229v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has emerged as a promising paradigm in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and small memory footprint. However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNN for images through a new coding method that exploits bit plane representation. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the accuracy of SNN without increasing model size. Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN. By leveraging the unique characteristics of bit planes, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond Complete Shapes: A Benchmark for Quantitative Evaluation of 3D Shape Surface Matching Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding correspondences between 3D deformable shapes is an important and long-standing problem in geometry processing, computer vision, graphics, and beyond. While various shape matching datasets exist, they are mostly static or limited in size, restricting their adaptation to different problem settings, including both full and partial shape matching. In particular the existing partial shape matching datasets are small (fewer than 100 shapes) and thus unsuitable for data-hungry machine learning approaches. Moreover, the type of partiality present in existing datasets is often artificial and far from realistic. To address these limitations, we introduce a generic and flexible framework for the procedural generation of challenging full and partial shape matching datasets. Our framework allows the propagation of custom annotations across shapes, making it useful for various applications. By utilising our framework and manually creating cross-dataset correspondences between seven existing (complete geometry) shape matching datasets, we propose a new large benchmark BeCoS with a total of 2543 shapes. Based on this, we offer several challenging benchmark settings, covering both full and partial matching, for which we evaluate respective state-of-the-art methods as baselines.</description>

      <title>Video-RAG: Visually-aligned Retrieval-Augmented Long Video Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13093v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing large video-language models (LVLMs) struggle to comprehend long videos correctly due to limited context. To address this problem, fine-tuning long-context LVLMs and employing GPT-based agents have emerged as promising solutions. However, fine-tuning LVLMs would require extensive high-quality data and substantial GPU resources, while GPT-based agents would rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this paper, we propose Video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Video-RAG), a training-free and cost-effective pipeline that employs visually-aligned auxiliary texts to help facilitate cross-modality alignment while providing additional information beyond the visual content. Specifically, we leverage open-source external tools to extract visually-aligned information from pure video data (e.g., audio, optical character, and object detection), and incorporate the extracted information into an existing LVLM as auxiliary texts, alongside video frames and queries, in a plug-and-play manner. Our Video-RAG offers several key advantages: (i) lightweight with low computing overhead due to single-turn retrieval; (ii) easy implementation and compatibility with any LVLM; and (iii) significant, consistent performance gains across long video understanding benchmarks, including Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench. Notably, our model demonstrates superior performance over proprietary models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o when utilized with a 72B model.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Coreset Selection via Iterative Subspace Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning increasingly relies on massive data with substantial storage, annotation, and training costs. To reduce costs, coreset selection finds a representative subset of data to train models while ideally performing on par with the full data training. To maximize performance, current state-of-the-art coreset methods select data using dataset-specific ground truth labels and training. However, these methodological requirements prevent selection at scale on real-world, unlabeled data. To that end, this paper addresses the selection of coresets that achieve state-of-the-art performance but without using any labels or training on candidate data. Instead, our solution, Zero-Shot Coreset Selection via Iterative Subspace Sampling (ZCore), uses previously-trained foundation models to generate zero-shot, high-dimensional embedding spaces to interpret unlabeled data. ZCore then iteratively quantifies the relative value of all candidate data based on coverage and redundancy in numerous subspace distributions. Finally, ZCore selects a coreset sized for any data budget to train downstream models. We evaluate ZCore on four datasets and outperform several state-of-the-art label-based methods, especially at low data rates that provide the most substantial cost reduction. On ImageNet, ZCore selections for 10% training data achieve a downstream validation accuracy of 53.99%, which outperforms prior label-based methods and removes annotation and training costs for 1.15 million images. Our paper's code is publicly available at https://github.com/voxel51/zcore.</description>

      <title>VideoLLM Knows When to Speak: Enhancing Time-Sensitive Video Comprehension with Video-Text Duet Interaction Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent researches on video large language models (VideoLLM) predominantly focus on model architectures and training datasets, leaving the interaction format between the user and the model under-explored. In existing works, users often interact with VideoLLMs by using the entire video and a query as input, after which the model generates a response. This interaction format constrains the application of VideoLLMs in scenarios such as live-streaming comprehension where videos do not end and responses are required in a real-time manner, and also results in unsatisfactory performance on time-sensitive tasks that requires localizing video segments. In this paper, we focus on a video-text duet interaction format. This interaction format is characterized by the continuous playback of the video, and both the user and the model can insert their text messages at any position during the video playback. When a text message ends, the video continues to play, akin to the alternative of two performers in a duet. We construct MMDuetIT, a video-text training dataset designed to adapt VideoLLMs to video-text duet interaction format. We also introduce the Multi-Answer Grounded Video Question Answering (MAGQA) task to benchmark the real-time response ability of VideoLLMs. Trained on MMDuetIT, MMDuet demonstrates that adopting the video-text duet interaction format enables the model to achieve significant improvements in various time-sensitive tasks (76% CIDEr on YouCook2 dense video captioning, 90\% mAP on QVHighlights highlight detection and 25% R@0.5 on Charades-STA temporal video grounding) with minimal training efforts, and also enable VideoLLMs to reply in a real-time manner as the video plays.</description>

      <title>VideoLights: Feature Refinement and Cross-Task Alignment Transformer for Joint Video Highlight Detection and Moment Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prevailing joint prediction transformers for Video Highlight Detection and Moment Retrieval (HD/MR) exhibit deficiencies in handling cross-task dynamics, achieving robust video-text alignment, and utilizing effective attention mechanisms, with the potential of Large Language/Vision-Language Models (LLMs/LVLMs) being largely untapped. This paper introduces VideoLights, a novel HD/MR framework addressing these limitations by incorporating: (i) Convolutional Projection and Feature Refinement modules with an alignment loss for enhanced video-text feature congruity; (ii) a Bi-Directional Cross-Modal Fusion network for strongly coupled query-aware representations; (iii) a Uni-directional joint-task feedback mechanism for synergistic task improvement; (iv) hard positive/negative losses for adaptive learning; and (v) the leveraging of LVLMs (e.g., BLIP-2) for superior multimodal feature integration and intelligent pre-training with synthetic data. Comprehensive evaluations on QVHighlights, TVSum, and Charades-STA benchmarks demonstrate that VideoLights significantly surpasses existing baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performances.

      <title>Splats in Splats: Robust and Effective 3D Steganography towards Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive 3D reconstruction performance with explicit scene representations. Given the widespread application of 3DGS in 3D reconstruction and generation tasks, there is an urgent need to protect the copyright of 3DGS assets. However, existing copyright protection techniques for 3DGS overlook the usability of 3D assets, posing challenges for practical deployment. Here we describe splats in splats, the first 3DGS steganography framework that embeds 3D content in 3DGS itself without modifying any attributes. To achieve this, we take a deep insight into spherical harmonics (SH) and devise an importance-graded SH coefficient encryption strategy to embed the hidden SH coefficients. Furthermore, we employ a convolutional autoencoder to establish a mapping between the original Gaussian primitives' opacity and the hidden Gaussian primitives' opacity. Extensive experiments indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing 3D steganography techniques, with 5.31% higher scene fidelity and 3x faster rendering speed, while ensuring security, robustness, and user experience.</description>

      <title>Faster and Better 3D Splatting via Group Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for novel view synthesis, demonstrating remarkable capability in high-fidelity scene reconstruction through its Gaussian primitive representations. However, the computational overhead induced by the massive number of primitives poses a significant bottleneck to training efficiency. To overcome this challenge, we propose Group Training, a simple yet effective strategy that organizes Gaussian primitives into manageable groups, optimizing training efficiency and improving rendering quality. This approach shows universal compatibility with existing 3DGS frameworks, including vanilla 3DGS and Mip-Splatting, consistently achieving accelerated training while maintaining superior synthesis quality. Extensive experiments reveal that our straightforward Group Training strategy achieves up to 30\% faster convergence and improved rendering quality across diverse scenarios.

      <title>Leverage Cross-Attention for End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction offers comprehensive scene understanding, enabling advances in embodied robotics and photorealistic simulation. In this paper, we propose PanopticRecon++, an end-to-end method that formulates panoptic reconstruction through a novel cross-attention perspective. This perspective models the relationship between 3D instances (as queries) and the scene's 3D embedding field (as keys) through their attention map. Unlike existing methods that separate the optimization of queries and keys or overlook spatial proximity, PanopticRecon++ introduces learnable 3D Gaussians as instance queries. This formulation injects 3D spatial priors to preserve proximity while maintaining end-to-end optimizability. Moreover, this query formulation facilitates the alignment of 2D open-vocabulary instance IDs across frames by leveraging optimal linear assignment with instance masks rendered from the queries. Additionally, we ensure semantic-instance segmentation consistency by fusing query-based instance segmentation probabilities with semantic probabilities in a novel panoptic head supervised by a panoptic loss. During training, the number of instance query tokens dynamically adapts to match the number of objects. PanopticRecon++ shows competitive performance in terms of 3D and 2D segmentation and reconstruction performance on both simulation and real-world datasets, and demonstrates a user case as a robot simulator.

      <description>arXiv:2501.03931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MagicMirror, a framework for generating identity-preserved videos with cinematic-level quality and dynamic motion. While recent advances in video diffusion models have shown impressive capabilities in text-to-video generation, maintaining consistent identity while producing natural motion remains challenging. Previous methods either require person-specific fine-tuning or struggle to balance identity preservation with motion diversity. Built upon Video Diffusion Transformers, our method introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch facial feature extractor that captures both identity and structural features, (2) a lightweight cross-modal adapter with Conditioned Adaptive Normalization for efficient identity integration, and (3) a two-stage training strategy combining synthetic identity pairs with video data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMirror effectively balances identity consistency with natural motion, outperforming existing methods across multiple metrics while requiring minimal parameters added. The code and model will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Teacher Encoder-Student Decoder Denoising Guided Segmentation Network for Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12104v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual anomaly detection is a highly challenging task, often categorized as a one-class classification and segmentation problem. Recent studies have demonstrated that the student-teacher (S-T) framework effectively addresses this challenge. However, most S-T frameworks rely solely on pre-trained teacher networks to guide student networks in learning multi-scale similar features, overlooking the potential of the student networks to enhance learning through multi-scale feature fusion. In this study, we propose a novel model named PFADSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student network with multi-scale feature fusion, and a guided anomaly segmentation network into a unified framework. By adopting a unique teacher-encoder and student-decoder denoising mode, the model improves the student network's ability to learn from teacher network features. Furthermore, an adaptive feature fusion mechanism is introduced to train a self-supervised segmentation network that synthesizes anomaly masks autonomously, significantly increasing detection performance. Rigorous evaluations on the widely-used MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that PFADSeg exhibits excellent performance, achieving an image-level AUC of 98.9%, a pixel-level mean precision of 76.4%, and an instance-level mean precision of 78.7%.</description>

      <title>RefDrone: A Challenging Benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension in Drone Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drones have become prevalent robotic platforms with diverse applications, showing significant potential in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI). Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code are be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</description>

      <title>DICE: Distilling Classifier-Free Guidance into Text Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are capable of generating high-quality images, but suboptimal pre-trained text representations often result in these images failing to align closely with the given text prompts. Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a popular and effective technique for improving text-image alignment in the generative process. However, CFG introduces significant computational overhead. In this paper, we present DIstilling CFG by sharpening text Embeddings (DICE) that replaces CFG in the sampling process with half the computational complexity while maintaining similar generation quality. DICE distills a CFG-based text-to-image diffusion model into a CFG-free version by refining text embeddings to replicate CFG-based directions. In this way, we avoid the computational drawbacks of CFG, enabling high-quality, well-aligned image generation at a fast sampling speed. Furthermore, examining the enhancement pattern, we identify the underlying mechanism of DICE that sharpens specific components of text embeddings to preserve semantic information while enhancing fine-grained details. Extensive experiments on multiple Stable Diffusion v1.5 variants, SDXL, and PixArt-$\alpha$ demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Interpretable and Testable Vision Features via Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To truly understand vision models, we must not only interpret their learned features but also validate these interpretations through controlled experiments. While earlier work offers either rich semantics or direct control, few post-hoc tools supply both in a single, model-agnostic procedure. We use sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to bridge this gap; each sparse feature comes with real-image exemplars that reveal its meaning and a decoding vector that can be manipulated to probe its influence on downstream task behavior. By applying our method to widely-used pre-trained vision models, we reveal meaningful differences in the semantic abstractions learned by different pre-training objectives. We then show that a single SAE trained on frozen ViT activations supports patch-level causal edits across tasks (classification and segmentation) all without retraining the ViT or task heads. These qualitative, falsifiable demonstrations position SAEs as a practical bridge between concept discovery and causal probing of vision models. We provide code, demos and models on our project website: https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/saev.</description>

      <title>ERANet: Edge Replacement Augmentation for Semi-Supervised Meniscus Segmentation with Prototype Consistency Alignment and Conditional Self-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manual segmentation is labor-intensive, and automatic segmentation remains challenging due to the inherent variability in meniscal morphology, partial volume effects, and low contrast between the meniscus and surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, we propose ERANet, an innovative semi-supervised framework for meniscus segmentation that effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled images through advanced augmentation and learning strategies. ERANet integrates three key components: edge replacement augmentation (ERA), prototype consistency alignment (PCA), and a conditional self-training (CST) strategy within a mean teacher architecture. ERA introduces anatomically relevant perturbations by simulating meniscal variations, ensuring that augmentations align with the structural context. PCA enhances segmentation performance by aligning intra-class features and promoting compact, discriminative feature representations, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. CST improves segmentation robustness by iteratively refining pseudo-labels and mitigating the impact of label noise during training. Together, these innovations establish ERANet as a robust and scalable solution for meniscus segmentation, effectively addressing key barriers to practical implementation. We validated ERANet comprehensively on 3D Double Echo Steady State (DESS) and 3D Fast/Turbo Spin Echo (FSE/TSE) MRI sequences. The results demonstrate the superior performance of ERANet compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed framework achieves reliable and accurate segmentation of meniscus structures, even when trained on minimal labeled data. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the synergistic contributions of ERA, PCA, and CST, solidifying ERANet as a transformative solution for semi-supervised meniscus segmentation in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Sketch-1-to-3: One Single Sketch to 3D Detailed Face Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D face reconstruction from a single sketch is a critical yet underexplored task with significant practical applications. The primary challenges stem from the substantial modality gap between 2D sketches and 3D facial structures, including: (1) accurately extracting facial keypoints from 2D sketches; (2) preserving diverse facial expressions and fine-grained texture details; and (3) training a high-performing model with limited data. In this paper, we propose Sketch-1-to-3, a novel framework for realistic 3D face reconstruction from a single sketch, to address these challenges. Specifically, we first introduce the Geometric Contour and Texture Detail (GCTD) module, which enhances the extraction of geometric contours and texture details from facial sketches. Additionally, we design a deep learning architecture with a domain adaptation module and a tailored loss function to align sketches with the 3D facial space, enabling high-fidelity expression and texture reconstruction. To facilitate evaluation and further research, we construct SketchFaces, a real hand-drawn facial sketch dataset, and Syn-SketchFaces, a synthetic facial sketch dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sketch-1-to-3 achieves state-of-the-art performance in sketch-based 3D face reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised and Source-Free Ranking of Biomedical Segmentation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model transfer presents a solution to the challenges of segmentation in the biomedical community, where the immense cost of data annotation is a major bottleneck in the use of deep learning. At the same time, hundreds of models get trained on biomedical data, submitted to challenges, and posted in model zoos and repositories. A major hurdle to wider adoption of pre-trained models lies in the lack of methods for best model selection. While such methods have been proposed for classification models, semantic and instance segmentation model ranking remain largely unaddressed, especially in a practically important setting where no labels are available on the target dataset. Similarly, if unsupervised domain adaptation is used, practitioners are faced with the task of selecting the best adapted model without target domain labels. Building on previous work linking model generalisation and consistency under perturbation, we propose the first unsupervised and source-free transferability estimator for semantic and instance segmentation tasks. We evaluate on multiple segmentation problems across biomedical imaging, finding a strong correlation between the rankings based on our estimator and rankings based on target dataset performance.</description>

      <title>From Spots to Pixels: Dense Spatial Gene Expression Prediction from Histology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures gene expression at fine-grained spatial resolution, offering insights into tissue molecular landscapes. Previous methods for spatial gene expression prediction typically crop spots of interest from histopathology slide images, and train models to map each spot to a corresponding gene expression profile. However, these methods inherently lose the spatial resolution in gene expression: 1) each spot often contains multiple cells with distinct gene expression profiles; 2) spots are typically defined at fixed spatial resolutions, limiting the ability to predict gene expression at varying scales. To address these limitations, this paper presents PixNet, a dense prediction network capable of predicting spatially resolved gene expression across spots of varying sizes and scales directly from histopathology slide images. Different from previous methods that map individual spots to gene expression values, we generate a spatially dense continuous gene expression map from the histopathology slide image, and aggregate values within spots of interest to predict the gene expression. Our PixNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four common ST datasets in multiple spatial scales. The source code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Monocular Person Localization under Camera Ego-motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localizing a person from a moving monocular camera is critical for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). To estimate the 3D human position from a 2D image, existing methods either depend on the geometric assumption of a fixed camera or use a position regression model trained on datasets containing little camera ego-motion. These methods are vulnerable to severe camera ego-motion, resulting in inaccurate person localization. We consider person localization as a part of a pose estimation problem. By representing a human with a four-point model, our method jointly estimates the 2D camera attitude and the person's 3D location through optimization. Evaluations on both public datasets and real robot experiments demonstrate our method outperforms baselines in person localization accuracy. Our method is further implemented into a person-following system and deployed on an agile quadruped robot.</description>

      <title>Studying Classifier(-Free) Guidance From a Classifier-Centric Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance has become a staple for conditional generation with denoising diffusion models. However, a comprehensive understanding of classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance. Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the classifier. On 1D data, we find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is usually entangled and is hard to learn. To validate this classifier-centric perspective on high-dimensional data, we assess whether a flow-matching postprocessing step that is designed to narrow the gap between a pre-trained diffusion model's learned distribution and the real data distribution, especially near decision boundaries, can improve the performance. Experiments on various datasets verify our classifier-centric understanding.</description>

      <title>Frame-wise Conditioning Adaptation for Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models in Text-to-Video Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-video prediction (TVP) is a downstream video generation task that requires a model to produce subsequent video frames given a series of initial video frames and text describing the required motion. In practice TVP methods focus on a particular category of videos depicting manipulations of objects carried out by human beings or robot arms. Previous methods adapt models pre-trained on text-to-image tasks, and thus tend to generate video that lacks the required continuity. A natural progression would be to leverage more recent pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) models. This approach is rendered more challenging by the fact that the most common fine-tuning technique, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), yields undesirable results. In this work, we propose an adaptation-based strategy we label Frame-wise Conditioning Adaptation (FCA). Within the module, we devise a sub-module that produces frame-wise text embeddings from the input text, which acts as an additional text condition to aid generation. We use FCA to fine-tune the T2V model, which incorporates the initial frame(s) as an extra condition. We compare and discuss the more effective strategy for injecting such embeddings into the T2V model. We conduct extensive ablation studies on our design choices with quantitative and qualitative performance analysis. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art for the task of TVP.

      <title>PSA-MIL: A Probabilistic Spatial Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are high-resolution digital scans widely used in medical diagnostics. WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances. While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution. This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches. Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity. To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations. Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>U-REPA: Aligning Diffusion U-Nets to ViTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representation Alignment (REPA) that aligns Diffusion Transformer (DiT) hidden-states with ViT visual encoders has proven highly effective in DiT training, demonstrating superior convergence properties, but it has not been validated on the canonical diffusion U-Net architecture that shows faster convergence compared to DiTs. However, adapting REPA to U-Net architectures presents unique challenges: (1) different block functionalities necessitate revised alignment strategies; (2) spatial-dimension inconsistencies emerge from U-Net's spatial downsampling operations; (3) space gaps between U-Net and ViT hinder the effectiveness of tokenwise alignment. To encounter these challenges, we propose \textbf{U-REPA}, a representation alignment paradigm that bridges U-Net hidden states and ViT features as follows: Firstly, we propose via observation that due to skip connection, the middle stage of U-Net is the best alignment option. Secondly, we propose upsampling of U-Net features after passing them through MLPs. Thirdly, we observe difficulty when performing tokenwise similarity alignment, and further introduces a manifold loss that regularizes the relative similarity between samples. Experiments indicate that the resulting U-REPA could achieve excellent generation quality and greatly accelerates the convergence speed. With CFG guidance interval, U-REPA could reach $FID&lt;1.5$ in 200 epochs or 1M iterations on ImageNet 256 $\times$ 256, and needs only half the total epochs to perform better than REPA under sd-vae-ft-ema.

      <title>Synergistic Bleeding Region and Point Detection in Laparoscopic Surgical Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intraoperative bleeding in laparoscopic surgery causes rapid obscuration of the operative field to hinder the surgical process and increases the risk of postoperative complications. Intelligent detection of bleeding areas can quantify the blood loss to assist decision-making, while locating bleeding points helps surgeons quickly identify the source of bleeding and achieve hemostasis in time to improve surgical success rates. To fill the benchmark gap, we first construct a real-world laparoscopic surgical bleeding detection dataset, named SurgBlood, comprising 5,330 frames from 95 surgical video clips with bleeding region and point annotations. Accordingly, we develop a dual-task synergistic online detector called BlooDet, enabling simultaneous detection of bleeding regions and points in laparoscopic surgery. The baseline embraces a dual-branch bidirectional guid- ance design based on Segment Anything Model 2. The mask branch detects bleeding regions through adaptive edge and point prompt embeddings, while the point branch leverages mask memory to induce bleeding point memory modeling and captures point motion direction via inter-frame optical flow. By coupled bidirectional guidance, our framework explores spatial-temporal correlations while exploiting memory modeling to infer current bleeding status. Extensive experiments indicate that our method outperforms 13 counterparts in bleeding detection.</description>

      <title>FreeInv: Free Lunch for Improving DDIM Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Naive DDIM inversion process usually suffers from a trajectory deviation issue, i.e., the latent trajectory during reconstruction deviates from the one during inversion. To alleviate this issue, previous methods either learn to mitigate the deviation or design cumbersome compensation strategy to reduce the mismatch error, exhibiting substantial time and computation cost. In this work, we present a nearly free-lunch method (named FreeInv) to address the issue more effectively and efficiently. In FreeInv, we randomly transform the latent representation and keep the transformation the same between the corresponding inversion and reconstruction time-step. It is motivated from a statistical perspective that an ensemble of DDIM inversion processes for multiple trajectories yields a smaller trajectory mismatch error on expectation. Moreover, through theoretical analysis and empirical study, we show that FreeInv performs an efficient ensemble of multiple trajectories. FreeInv can be freely integrated into existing inversion-based image and video editing techniques. Especially for inverting video sequences, it brings more significant fidelity and efficiency improvements. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation on PIE benchmark and DAVIS dataset shows that FreeInv remarkably outperforms conventional DDIM inversion, and is competitive among previous state-of-the-art inversion methods, with superior computation efficiency.</description>

      <title>JointTuner: Appearance-Motion Adaptive Joint Training for Customized Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in customized video generation have led to significant improvements in the simultaneous adaptation of appearance and motion. Typically, decoupling the appearance and motion training, prior methods often introduce concept interference, resulting in inaccurate rendering of appearance features or motion patterns. In addition, these methods often suffer from appearance contamination, in which background and foreground elements from reference videos distort the customized video. This paper aims to alleviate these issues by proposing JointTuner. The core motivation of our JointTuner is to enable joint optimization of both appearance and motion components, upon which two key innovations are developed, i.e., Gated Low-Rank Adaptation (GLoRA) and Appearance-independent Temporal Loss (AiT Loss). Specifically, GLoRA uses a context-aware activation layer, analogous to a gating regulator, to dynamically steer LoRA modules toward learning either appearance or motion while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Moreover, with the finding that channel-temporal shift noise suppresses appearance-related low-frequencies while enhancing motion-related high-frequencies, we designed the AiT Loss. This loss adds the same shift to the diffusion model's predicted noise during fine-tuning, forcing the model to prioritize learning motion patterns. JointTuner's architecture-agnostic design supports both UNet (e.g., ZeroScope) and Diffusion Transformer (e.g., CogVideoX) backbones, ensuring its customization capabilities scale with the evolution of foundational video models. Furthermore, we present a systematic evaluation framework for appearance-motion combined customization, covering 90 combinations evaluated along four critical dimensions: semantic alignment, motion dynamism, temporal consistency, and perceptual quality.

      <title>Benchmarking the Spatial Robustness of DNNs via Natural and Adversarial Localized Corruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The robustness of deep neural networks is a crucial factor in safety-critical applications, particularly in complex and dynamic environments (e.g., medical or driving scenarios) where localized corruptions can arise. While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remains underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing novel, region-aware metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, along with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of natural localized corruptions. Furthermore, it uncovers the inherent complexity of evaluating worst-case spatial robustness using only a single localized adversarial attack. To address this, the work proposes a region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis to systematically assess model robustness across specific image regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were exploited to evaluate 14 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones, and vice versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success, recent reconstruction-based anomaly detection (AD) methods via diffusion modeling still involve fine-grained noise-strength tuning and computationally expensive multi-step denoising, leading to a fundamental tension between fidelity and efficiency. In this paper, we propose InvAD, a novel inversion-based anomaly detection approach ("detection via noising in latent space") that circumvents explicit reconstruction. Importantly, we contend that the limitations in prior reconstruction-based methods originate from the prevailing "detection via denoising in RGB space" paradigm. To address this, we model AD under a reconstruction-free formulation, which directly infers the final latent variable corresponding to the input image via DDIM inversion, and then measures the deviation based on the known prior distribution for anomaly scoring. Specifically, in approximating the original probability flow ODE using the Euler method, we enforce only a few inversion steps to noise the clean image to pursue inference efficiency. As the added noise is adaptively derived with the learned diffusion model, the original features for the clean testing image can still be leveraged to yield high detection accuracy. We perform extensive experiments and detailed analyses across four widely used industrial and medical AD benchmarks under the unsupervised unified setting to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving state-of-the-art AD performance and approximately 2x inference-time speedup without diffusion distillation.</description>

      <title>A Training-Free Style-aligned Image Generation with Scale-wise Autoregressive Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a training-free style-aligned image generation method that leverages a scale-wise autoregressive model. While large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models, particularly diffusion-based methods, have demonstrated impressive generation quality, they often suffer from style misalignment across generated image sets and slow inference speeds, limiting their practical usability. To address these issues, we propose three key components: initial feature replacement to ensure consistent background appearance, pivotal feature interpolation to align object placement, and dynamic style injection, which reinforces style consistency using a schedule function. Unlike previous methods requiring fine-tuning or additional training, our approach maintains fast inference while preserving individual content details. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves generation quality comparable to competing approaches, significantly improves style alignment, and delivers inference speeds over six times faster than the fastest model.</description>

      <title>Prompt Guiding Multi-Scale Adaptive Sparse Representation-driven Network for Low-Dose CT MAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) is capable of reducing X-ray radiation exposure, but it will potentially degrade image quality, even yields metal artifacts at the case of metallic implants. For simultaneous LDCT reconstruction and metal artifact reduction (LDMAR), existing deep learning-based efforts face two main limitations: i) the network design neglects multi-scale and within-scale information; ii) training a distinct model for each dose necessitates significant storage space for multiple doses. To fill these gaps, we propose a prompt guiding multi-scale adaptive sparse representation-driven network, abbreviated as PMSRNet, for LDMAR task. Specifically, we construct PMSRNet inspired from multi-scale sparsifying frames, and it can simultaneously employ within-scale characteristics and cross-scale complementarity owing to an elaborated prompt guiding scale-adaptive threshold generator (PSATG) and a built multi-scale coefficient fusion module (MSFuM). The PSATG can adaptively capture multiple contextual information to generate more faithful thresholds, achieved by fusing features from local, regional, and global levels. Furthermore, we elaborate a model interpretable dual domain LDMAR framework called PDuMSRNet, and train single model with a prompt guiding strategy for multiple dose levels. We build a prompt guiding module, whose input contains dose level, metal mask and input instance, to provide various guiding information, allowing a single model to accommodate various CT dose settings. Extensive experiments at various dose levels demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art LDMAR methods.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Efficient Video Generation via Dynamic Token Carving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable generation quality of video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, their practical deployment is severely hindered by extensive computational requirements. This inefficiency stems from two key challenges: the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to token length and the multi-step nature of diffusion models. To address these limitations, we present Jenga, a novel inference pipeline that combines dynamic attention carving with progressive resolution generation. Our approach leverages two key insights: (1) early denoising steps do not require high-resolution latents, and (2) later steps do not require dense attention. Jenga introduces a block-wise attention mechanism that dynamically selects relevant token interactions using 3D space-filling curves, alongside a progressive resolution strategy that gradually increases latent resolution during generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Jenga achieves substantial speedups across multiple state-of-the-art video diffusion models while maintaining comparable generation quality (8.83$\times$ speedup with 0.01\% performance drop on VBench). As a plug-and-play solution, Jenga enables practical, high-quality video generation on modern hardware by reducing inference time from minutes to seconds -- without requiring model retraining.

      <title>SplatCo: Structure-View Collaborative Gaussian Splatting for Detail-Preserving Rendering of Large-Scale Unbounded Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SplatCo, a structure-view collaborative Gaussian splatting framework for high-fidelity rendering of complex outdoor environments. SplatCo builds upon two novel components: (1) a cross-structure collaboration module that combines global tri-plane representations, which capture coarse scene layouts, with local context grid features that represent fine surface details. This fusion is achieved through a novel hierarchical compensation strategy, ensuring both global consistency and local detail preservation; and (2) a cross-view assisted training strategy that enhances multi-view consistency by synchronizing gradient updates across viewpoints, applying visibility-aware densification, and pruning overfitted or inaccurate Gaussians based on structural consistency. Through joint optimization of structural representation and multi-view coherence, SplatCo effectively reconstructs fine-grained geometric structures and complex textures in large-scale scenes. Comprehensive evaluations on 13 diverse large-scale scenes, including Mill19, MatrixCity, Tanks &amp; Temples, WHU, and custom aerial captures, demonstrate that SplatCo consistently achieves higher reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art methods, with PSNR improvements of 1-2 dB and SSIM gains of 0.1 to 0.2. These results establish a new benchmark for high-fidelity rendering of large-scale unbounded scenes.

      <description>arXiv:2505.19161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In endoscopic surgery, a clear and high-quality visual field is critical for surgeons to make accurate intraoperative decisions. However, persistent visual degradation, including smoke generated by energy devices, lens fogging from thermal gradients, and lens contamination due to blood or tissue fluid splashes during surgical procedures, severely impairs visual clarity. These degenerations can seriously hinder surgical workflow and pose risks to patient safety. To systematically investigate and address various forms of surgical scene degradation, we introduce a real- world open-source surgical image restoration dataset covering endoscopic environments, called SurgClean, which involves multi-type image restoration tasks from two medical sites, i.e., desmoking, defogging, and desplashing. SurgClean comprises 3,113 images with diverse degradation types and corresponding paired reference labels. Based on SurgClean, we establish a standardized evaluation benchmark and provide performance for 22 representative generic task-specific image restoration approaches, including 12 generic and 10 task-specific image restoration approaches. Experimental results reveal substantial performance gaps relative to clinical requirements, highlighting a critical opportunity for algorithm advancements in intelligent surgical restoration. Furthermore, we explore the degradation discrepancies between surgical and natural scenes from structural perception and semantic under- standing perspectives, providing fundamental insights for domain-specific image restoration research. Our work aims to empower restoration algorithms and improve the efficiency of clinical procedures.</description>

      <title>FlowCut: Rethinking Redundancy via Information Flow for Efficient Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration; and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x speed-up in the prefilling stage.

      <title>DSOcc: Leveraging Depth Awareness and Semantic Aid to Boost Camera-Based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20951v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for perceiving surrounding scenes in autonomous driving. However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference, leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging \textbf{D}epth awareness and \textbf{S}emantic aid to boost camera-based 3D semantic \textbf{Occ}upancy prediction (\textbf{DSOcc}). We jointly perform occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence is calculated by non-learning method and multiplied with image features to make voxels aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit occupancy state inference. Instead of enhancing feature learning, we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among camera-based methods and achieves competitive performance on the SSCBench-KITTI-360 and Occ3D-nuScenes datasets. Code will be released on github.</description>

      <title>Learning to Upscale 3D Segmentations in Neuroimaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining high-resolution (HR) segmentations from coarse annotations is a pervasive challenge in computer vision. Applications include inferring pixel-level segmentations from token-level labels in vision transformers, upsampling coarse masks to full resolution, and transferring annotations from legacy low-resolution (LR) datasets to modern HR imagery. These challenges are especially acute in 3D neuroimaging, where manual labeling is costly and resolutions continually increase. We propose a scalable framework that generalizes across resolutions and domains by regressing signed distance maps, enabling smooth, boundary-aware supervision. Crucially, our model predicts one class at a time, which substantially reduces memory usage during training and inference (critical for large 3D volumes) and naturally supports generalization to unseen classes. Generalization is further improved through training on synthetic, domain-randomized data. We validate our approach on ultra-high-resolution (UHR) human brain MRI (~100 {\mu}m), where most existing methods operate at 1 mm resolution. Our framework effectively upsamples such standard-resolution segmentations to UHR detail. Results on synthetic and real data demonstrate superior scalability and generalization compared to conventional segmentation methods.

      <title>MedBridge: Bridging Foundation Vision-Language Models to Medical Image Diagnosis in Chest X-Ray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent vision-language foundation models deliver state-of-the-art results in natural image classification, but falter in medical images due to pronounced domain shifts. Training a medical foundation model also requires substantial resources, including extensive annotated data and high computational capacity. To bridge this gap with minimal overhead, we introduce MedBridge, a lightweight multimodal adaptation framework that flexibly re-purposes arbitrary pre-trained foundation VLMs for medical image diagnosis. MedBridge comprises three novel core components. First, a Focal Sampling module that subsamples and extracts high-resolution local regions to capture subtle pathological features, compensating for the limited input resolution of foundation VLMs. Second, a Query-Encoder model with a small set of learnable queries to align the feature maps of frozen VLMs with medical semantics, without requiring retraining of the backbone layers. Third, a Mixture of Experts mechanism, driven by learnable queries, harnesses the complementary strength of various VLMs to maximize diagnostic performance. We evaluate MedBridge on five chest radiograph benchmarks in three key adaptation tasks, demonstrating its superior performance in both cross-domain and in-domain adaptation settings under varying levels of training data availability. MedBridge achieved an improvement of 6-15% in AUC compared to state-of-the-art VLM adaptation methods in multi-label thoracic disease diagnosis, underscoring its effectiveness in leveraging diverse foundation models for accurate and data-efficient medical diagnosis. Our project and code are available at https://github.com/ai-med/MedBridge.</description>

      <title>SA-Person: Text-Based Person Retrieval with Scene-aware Re-ranking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-based person retrieval aims to identify a target individual from an image gallery using a natural language description. Existing methods primarily focus on appearance-driven cross-modal retrieval, yet face significant challenges due to the visual complexity of scenes and the inherent ambiguity of textual descriptions. The contextual information, such as landmarks and relational cues, provides complementary cues that can offer valuable complementary insights for retrieval, but remains underexploited in current approaches. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a novel paradigm: scene-aware text-based person retrieval, which explicitly integrates both individual appearance and global scene context to improve retrieval accuracy. To support this, we first introduce ScenePerson-13W, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising over 100,000 real-world scenes with rich annotations encompassing both pedestrian attributes and scene context. Based on this dataset, we further present SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework. In the first stage, SA-Person performs discriminative appearance grounding by aligning textual descriptions with pedestrian-specific regions. In the second stage, it introduces SceneRanker, a training-free, scene-aware re-ranking module that refines retrieval results by jointly reasoning over pedestrian appearance and the global scene context. Extensive experiments on ScenePerson-13W and existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SA-Person. Both the dataset and code will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>HOSIG: Full-Body Human-Object-Scene Interaction Generation with Hierarchical Scene Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating high-fidelity full-body human interactions with dynamic objects and static scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and animation. Existing methods for human-object interaction often neglect scene context, leading to implausible penetrations, while human-scene interaction approaches struggle to coordinate fine-grained manipulations with long-range navigation. To address these limitations, we propose HOSIG, a novel framework for synthesizing full-body interactions through hierarchical scene perception. Our method decouples the task into three key components: 1) a scene-aware grasp pose generator that ensures collision-free whole-body postures with precise hand-object contact by integrating local geometry constraints, 2) a heuristic navigation algorithm that autonomously plans obstacle-avoiding paths in complex indoor environments via compressed 2D floor maps and dual-component spatial reasoning, and 3) a scene-guided motion diffusion model that generates trajectory-controlled, full-body motions with finger-level accuracy by incorporating spatial anchors and dual-space classifier-free guidance. Extensive experiments on the TRUMANS dataset demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework supports unlimited motion length through autoregressive generation and requires minimal manual intervention. This work bridges the critical gap between scene-aware navigation and dexterous object manipulation, advancing the frontier of embodied interaction synthesis. Codes will be available after publication. Project page: http://yw0208.github.io/hosig</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plant Disease Detection (PDD) is a key aspect of precision agriculture. However, existing deep learning methods often rely on extensively annotated datasets, which are time-consuming and costly to generate. Self-supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by exploiting the abundance of unlabeled data. However, most existing SSL approaches suffer from high computational costs due to convolutional neural networks or transformer-based architectures. Additionally, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies in visual representation and rely on static loss functions that fail to align local and global features effectively. To address these challenges, we propose ConMamba, a novel SSL framework specially designed for PDD. ConMamba integrates the Vision Mamba Encoder (VME), which employs a bidirectional State Space Model (SSM) to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level contrastive loss with dynamic weight adjustment to optimize local-global feature alignment. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics. This provides an efficient and robust solution for PDD.</description>

      <title>ControlThinker: Unveiling Latent Semantics for Controllable Image Generation through Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of controllable image generation has seen significant advancements, with various architectures improving generation layout consistency with control signals. However, contemporary methods still face challenges in bridging the semantic gap between input text prompts with sparse semantics and the target images, often over-relying on low-level control signals to infer regional details. To address this challenge, we propose ControlThinker, a novel framework that employs a "comprehend-then-generate" paradigm. Firstly, by incentivizing the visual reasoning capability of a MLLM, latent semantics from control images are mined to enrich text prompts. This enriched semantic understanding then seamlessly aids in image generation without the need for additional complex modifications. To further tackle the uncertainty arising from the ambiguity of control images, we encourage broader exploration of reasoning trajectories and select the optimal one using a metric-based output reward model (ORM). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ControlThinker effectively mitigates the semantic gap between raw text prompts and target images, resulting in improved visual quality and semantic consistency across a wide range of benchmarks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Maplebb/ControlThinker.</description>

      <title>Q-SAM2: Accurate Quantization for Segment Anything Model 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a powerful foundation model for promptable segmentation. However, its high computational and memory costs are a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present Q-SAM2, an accurate low-bit quantization method that achieves high compression and high fidelity. To address performance degradation arising from challenging weight and activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel contributions: Variance-Reduced Calibration (VRC), an initialization method that reduces weight statistical variance by minimizing the Frobenius norm over a small calibration batch; and Learnable Statistical Clipping (LSC), a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) method that learns momentum-stabilized clipping factors to manage outliers in weights and activations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Q-SAM2 achieves highly accurate inference with substantial efficiency gains, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art general QAT schemes, particularly in the ultra-low 2-bit regime. Specifically, Q-SAM2 achieves an accuracy gain of up to 9.7 ppt in J&amp;F on the video segmentation benchmark and 7.3 ppt in mIoU for instance segmentation over the best competing QAT model, all while achieving an 8x reduction in model size compared to the BF16 baseline.</description>

      <title>Motion-R1: Enhancing Motion Generation with Decomposed Chain-of-Thought and RL Binding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-Motion generation has become a fundamental task in human-machine interaction, enabling the synthesis of realistic human motions from natural language descriptions. Although recent advances in large language models and reinforcement learning have contributed to high-quality motion generation, two major challenges remain. Existing approaches often fail to capture the temporal and causal complexities inherent in natural language, leading to oversimplified or incoherent motions. Additionally, RL-based methods are frequently overly complex, hindering their scalability and adaptability across various motion generation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Motion-R1, a novel framework that combines decomposed Chain-of-Thought reasoning with reinforcement learning to enhance both the quality and interpretability of generated motions. Specifically, we introduce the Decomposed CoT Data Engine, which leverages an automated pipeline to synthesize high-quality reasoning data, allowing the model to better capture the temporal dependencies and causal relationships of human motion. We also propose RL Binding, a reinforcement learning strategy that incorporates multi-modal text-motion alignment into the RL reward function, guiding the model to produce motions that are both semantically accurate and motionally realistic. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that Motion-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.5% improvement in MM-Dist on HumanML3D and improvements in R-Precision and FID on KIT-ML and BABEL, surpassing existing methods across key metrics and highlighting its superior capability in handling complex motion generation tasks.

      <title>Automatic Multi-View X-Ray/CT Registration Using Bone Substructure Contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Accurate intraoperative X-ray/CT registration is essential for surgical navigation in orthopedic procedures. However, existing methods struggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under broad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT registration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed registration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest point (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone contours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on matching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone substructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in a more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only two X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute a dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image poses and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method is evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The method consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm compared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention. Furthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully automatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient solution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which can be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration accuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative navigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in computer-assisted surgery (CAS).</description>

      <title>AdaVideoRAG: Omni-Contextual Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Efficient Long Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well in video understanding but degrade on long videos due to fixed-length context and weak long-term dependency modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can expand knowledge dynamically, yet existing video RAG schemes adopt fixed retrieval paradigms that ignore query difficulty. This uniform design causes redundant computation and latency for simple queries, while coarse retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning can miss key information. Such single-step retrieval severely limits the trade-off between efficiency and cognitive depth. We propose AdaVideoRAG, an adaptive RAG framework for long-video understanding. A lightweight intent classifier dynamically selects suitable retrieval schemes according to query complexity from the simplest to the most sophisticated. We design an Omni-Knowledge Indexing module that extracts and organizes multi-modal information into three databases: (1) a text base built from clip captions, ASR, and OCR; (2) a visual base; and (3) a knowledge graph for deep semantic understanding. This supports hierarchical knowledge access, from naive retrieval to graph-based retrieval, balancing resource cost and reasoning ability. To evaluate deep understanding, we further construct the HiVU benchmark. Experiments show that AdaVideoRAG significantly improves both efficiency and accuracy on long-video QA tasks and can be seamlessly plugged into existing MLLMs through lightweight APIs, establishing a new paradigm for adaptive retrieval-augmented video analysis.</description>

      <title>Visual Anagrams Reveal Hidden Differences in Holistic Shape Processing Across Vision Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence, operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii) uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions: radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture, but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate both local-texture and global configural shape.</description>

      <title>RichControl: Structure- and Appearance-Rich Training-Free Spatial Control for Text-to-Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., canny edge) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning-based approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. Through an empirical analysis of existing methods, we identify a key limitation: the sampling schedule of condition features, previously unexplored, fails to account for the evolving interplay between structure preservation and domain alignment throughout diffusion steps. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible training-free framework that decouples the sampling schedule of condition features from the denoising process, and systematically investigate the spectrum of feature injection schedules for a higher-quality structure guidance in the feature space. Specifically, we find that condition features sampled from a single timestep are sufficient, yielding a simple yet efficient schedule that balances structure alignment and appearance quality. We further enhance the sampling process by introducing a restart refinement schedule, and improve the visual quality with an appearance-rich prompting strategy. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Laboratory mice, particularly the C57BL/6 strain, are essential animal models in biomedical research. However, accurate 3D surface motion reconstruction of mice remains a significant challenge due to their complex non-rigid deformations, textureless fur-covered surfaces, and the lack of realistic 3D mesh models. Moreover, existing visual datasets for mice reconstruction only contain sparse viewpoints without 3D geometries. To fill the gap, we introduce MoReMouse, the first monocular dense 3D reconstruction network specifically designed for C57BL/6 mice. To achieve high-fidelity 3D reconstructions, we present three key innovations. First, we create the first high-fidelity, dense-view synthetic dataset for C57BL/6 mice by rendering a realistic, anatomically accurate Gaussian mouse avatar. Second, MoReMouse leverages a transformer-based feedforward architecture combined with triplane representation, enabling high-quality 3D surface generation from a single image, optimized for the intricacies of small animal morphology. Third, we propose geodesic-based continuous correspondence embeddings on the mouse surface, which serve as strong semantic priors, improving surface consistency and reconstruction stability, especially in highly dynamic regions like limbs and tail. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that MoReMouse significantly outperforms existing open-source methods in both accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>DMAT: An End-to-End Framework for Joint Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigation and Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric Turbulence (AT) degrades the clarity and accuracy of surveillance imagery, posing challenges not only for visualization quality but also for object classification and scene tracking. Deep learning-based methods have been proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end training strategy leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector. Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets corrupted by generated turbulence.</description>

      <title>Backdoors in Conditional Diffusion: Threats to Responsible Synthetic Data Pipelines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve high-fidelity image generation from natural language prompts. ControlNets extend these models by enabling conditioning on structural inputs (e.g., edge maps, depth, pose), providing fine-grained control over outputs. Yet their reliance on large, publicly scraped datasets and community fine-tuning makes them vulnerable to data poisoning. We introduce a model-poisoning attack that embeds a covert backdoor into a ControlNet, causing it to produce attacker-specified content when exposed to visual triggers, without textual prompts. Experiments show that poisoning only 1% of the fine-tuning corpus yields a 90-98% attack success rate, while 5% further strengthens the backdoor, all while preserving normal generation quality. To mitigate this risk, we propose clean fine-tuning (CFT): freezing the diffusion backbone and fine-tuning only the ControlNet on a sanitized dataset with a reduced learning rate. CFT lowers attack success rates on held-out data. These results expose a critical security weakness in open-source, ControlNet-guided diffusion pipelines and demonstrate that CFT offers a practical defense for responsible synthetic-data pipelines.</description>

      <title>D-FCGS: Feedforward Compression of Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Free-Viewpoint Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient compression of dynamic 3D representation remains a major challenge. Existing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting methods couple reconstruction with optimization-dependent compression and customized motion formats, limiting generalization and standardization. To address this, we propose D-FCGS, a novel Feedforward Compression framework for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting. Key innovations include: (1) a standardized Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P coding, leveraging sparse control points to extract inter-frame motion tensors; (2) a dual prior-aware entropy model that fuses hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate estimation; (3) a control-point-guided motion compensation mechanism and refinement network to enhance view-consistent fidelity. Trained on Gaussian frames derived from multi-view videos, D-FCGS generalizes across diverse scenes in a zero-shot fashion. Experiments show that it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods, achieving over 40 times compression compared to the baseline while preserving visual quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression of dynamic 3DGS, facilitating scalable FVV transmission and storage for immersive applications.</description>

      <title>COLI: A Hierarchical Efficient Compressor for Large Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images, thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios. To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images), a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First, recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm, mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13861v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization excels in fidelity, yet fine-grained instance-level spatial control remains an elusive challenge, hindering real-world applications. This limitation stems from two factors: a scarcity of scalable, position-annotated datasets, and the entanglement of identity and layout by global attention mechanisms. To this end, we introduce \modelname{}, a unified framework for high-fidelity, spatially controllable multi-subject customization. First, we present BMPDS, the first automatic data-synthesis pipeline for position-annotated multi-subject datasets, effectively providing crucial spatial supervision. Second, we design a lightweight, layout-aware diffusion framework that integrates a novel visibility-aware attention mechanism. This mechanism explicitly models spatial relationships via an NeRF-inspired volumetric weight regulation to effectively decouple instance-level spatial embeddings from semantic identity features, enabling precise, occlusion-aware placement of multiple subjects.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate \modelname{} achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, setting new records for spatial precision and identity consistency. Our work represents a significant step towards truly controllable, high-fidelity image customization in multi-entity scenarios. Code and data will be publicly released.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce $\textbf{AVATAR}$ ($\textbf{A}$udio-$\textbf{V}$ideo $\textbf{A}$gen$\textbf{t}$ for $\textbf{A}$lignment and $\textbf{R}$easoning), a framework that addresses these limitations through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping (TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases during learning. $\textbf{AVATAR}$ achieves strong performance across various benchmarks, outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by $\mathbf{+5.4}$ on MMVU, $\mathbf{+4.9}$ on OmniBench, and $\mathbf{+4.5}$ on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating $\textbf{$5$$\times$ sample efficiency}$, requiring $80\%$ fewer generated completions to reach target performance.</description>

      <title>SGDFuse: SAM-Guided Diffusion for High-Fidelity Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05264v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks. However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion.

      <title>Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats, allowing for direct stylization on a .ply or .splat file without requiring the original camera views. This is done by generating a graph structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated back to the individual splats in the scene. This also allows for fast stylization of splats with no additional training, achieving speeds under 2 minutes even on CPU-based consumer hardware. We demonstrate the quality results this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer methods. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.</description>

      <title>Find Them All: Unveiling MLLMs for Versatile Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve images of a target person from the gallery set, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation and public security. However, traditional person ReID models are typically uni-modal, resulting in limited generalizability across heterogeneous data modalities. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has shown a promising avenue for addressing this issue. Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature extractors or caption generators, leaving their capabilities in person ReID tasks largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark for \underline{\textbf{V}}ersatile \underline{\textbf{P}}erson \underline{\textbf{Re}}-\underline{\textbf{ID}}entification, termed VP-ReID. The benchmark includes 257,310 multi-modal queries and gallery images, covering ten diverse person ReID tasks. In addition, we propose two task-oriented evaluation schemes for MLLM-based person ReID. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive versatility, effectiveness, and interpretability of MLLMs in various person ReID tasks. Nevertheless, they also have limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared data. We hope that VP-ReID can facilitate the community in developing more robust and generalizable cross-modal foundation models for person ReID.</description>

      <title>OMGSR: You Only Need One Mid-timestep Guidance for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) show promising potential in one-step Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Current one-step Real-ISR methods typically inject the low-quality (LQ) image latent representation at the start or end timestep of the DDPM scheduler. Recent studies have begun to note that the LQ image latent and the pre-trained noisy latent representations are intuitively closer at a mid-timestep. However, a quantitative analysis of these latent representations remains lacking. Considering these latent representations can be decomposed into signal and noise, we propose a method based on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to pre-compute an average optimal mid-timestep for injection. To better approximate the pre-trained noisy latent representation, we further introduce the Latent Representation Refinement (LRR) loss via a LoRA-enhanced VAE encoder. We also fine-tune the backbone of the DDPM-based generative model using LoRA to perform one-step denoising at the average optimal mid-timestep. Based on these components, we present OMGSR, a GAN-based Real-ISR framework that employs a DDPM-based generative model as the generator and a DINOv3-ConvNeXt model with multi-level discriminator heads as the discriminator. We also propose the DINOv3-ConvNeXt DISTS (Dv3CD) loss, which is enhanced for structural perception at varying resolutions. Within the OMGSR framework, we develop OMGSR-S based on SD2.1-base. An ablation study confirms that our pre-computation strategy and LRR loss significantly improve the baseline. Comparative studies demonstrate that OMGSR-S achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. Code is available at \hyperlink{Github}{https://github.com/wuer5/OMGSR}.</description>

      <title>IAG: Input-aware Backdoor Attack on VLM-based Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly enhanced the visual grounding task, which involves locating objects in an image based on natural language queries. Despite these advancements, the security of VLM-based grounding systems has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper reveals a novel and realistic vulnerability: the first multi-target backdoor attack on VLM-based visual grounding. Unlike prior attacks that rely on static triggers or fixed targets, we propose IAG, a method that dynamically generates input-aware, text-guided triggers conditioned on any specified target object description to execute the attack. This is achieved through a text-conditioned UNet that embeds imperceptible target semantic cues into visual inputs while preserving normal grounding performance on benign samples. We further develop a joint training objective that balances language capability with perceptual reconstruction to ensure imperceptibility, effectiveness, and stealth. Extensive experiments on multiple VLMs (e.g., LLaVA, InternVL, Ferret) and benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, Flickr30k Entities, and ShowUI) demonstrate that IAG achieves the best ASRs compared with other baselines on almost all settings without compromising clean accuracy, maintaining robustness against existing defenses, and exhibiting transferability across datasets and models. These findings underscore critical security risks in grounding-capable VLMs and highlight the need for further research on trustworthy multimodal understanding.</description>

      <title>Vision-Only Gaussian Splatting for Collaborative Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information, overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU, respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6% communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited communication budgets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generations have demonstrated diffusion model's potential as world models by capturing complex physical dynamics and interactive behaviors. However, existing interactive world models depend on bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to effectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with diverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables frame-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step distillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video generation. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our model weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.</description>

      <title>Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that, unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over 98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize generated samples and the generation process: https://scaffold.deepexploration.org/</description>

      <title>InfoScale: Unleashing Training-free Variable-scaled Image Generation via Effective Utilization of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise. Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3) The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose \textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and achieve an effective balance between local and global information in higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3), we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image generation.</description>

      <title>PointAD+: Learning Hierarchical Representations for Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03277v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric, enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference, we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Decomposition of Reflectance and Shading using a Single Visible-Thermal Image Pair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decomposing an image into its underlying photometric factors--surface reflectance and shading--is a long-standing challenge due to the lack of extensive ground-truth data for real-world scenes. We introduce a novel physics-based approach for intrinsic image decomposition using a pair of visible and thermal images. We leverage the principle that light not reflected from an opaque surface is absorbed and detected as heat by a thermal camera. This allows us to relate the ordinalities (or relative magnitudes) between visible and thermal image intensities to the ordinalities of shading and reflectance, which enables a dense self-supervision of an optimizing neural network to recover shading and reflectance. We perform quantitative evaluations with known reflectance and shading under natural and artificial lighting, and qualitative experiments across diverse scenes. The results demonstrate superior performance over both physics-based and recent learning-based methods, providing a path toward scalable real-world data curation with supervision.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Visual Autonomous Parking via Control-Aided Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively provides policy-relevant details - especially in critical areas where fine control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches lack effective synergy between perception and control. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA) mechanism. We train such an attention module in a self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages attention to focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather than merely minimizing the training loss - a shift we demonstrate leads to a more robust and generalizable policy. To further strengthen the framework, CAA-Policy incorporates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task to improve temporal consistency of control outputs, a learnable motion prediction module to robustly track target slots over time, and a modified target tokenization scheme for more effective feature fusion. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that CAA-Policy consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. Code and Collected Training datasets will be released. Code is released at https://github.com/ai4ce/CAAPolicy.</description>

      <title>Neural Collapse-Inspired Multi-Label Federated Learning under Label-Distribution Skew</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet it remains challenging as data distributions can be highly heterogeneous. These challenges are further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data exhibit characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships. While most existing FL studies focus on single-label classification, real-world applications, such as in medical imaging, involve multi-label data with highly skewed label distributions across clients. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose FedNCA-ML, a novel FL framework that aligns feature distributions across clients and learns discriminative, well-clustered representations inspired by Neural Collapse (NC) theory. NC describes an ideal latent-space geometry where each class's features collapse to their mean, forming a maximally separated simplex. To extend this theory to multi-label settings, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that extracts class-specific representations. The clustering of these disentangled features is guided by a shared NC-inspired structure, mitigating conflicts among client models caused by heterogeneous local data. Furthermore, we design regularisation losses to encourage compact and consistent feature clustering in the latent space. Experiments on four benchmark datasets under eight FL settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving improvements of up to 3.92% in class-wise AUC and 4.93% in class-wise F1 score.</description>

      <title>LivePyxel: Accelerating image annotations with a Python-integrated webcam live streaming</title>

Abstract: The lack of flexible annotation tools has hindered the deployment of AI models in some scientific areas. Most existing image annotation software requires users to upload a precollected dataset, which limits support for on-demand pipelines and introduces unnecessary steps to acquire images. This constraint is particularly problematic in laboratory environments, where on-site data acquisition from instruments such as microscopes is increasingly common. In this work, we introduce \texttt{LivePixel}, a Python-based graphical user interface that integrates with imaging systems, such as webcams, microscopes, and others, to enable on-site image annotation. LivePyxel is designed to be easy to use through a simple interface that allows users to precisely delimit areas for annotation using tools commonly found in commercial graphics editing software. Of particular interest is the availability of B\'ezier splines and binary masks, and the software's capacity to work with non-destructive layers that enable high-performance editing. LivePyxel also integrates a wide compatibility across video devices, and it's optimized for object detection operations via the use of OpenCV in combination with high-performance libraries designed to handle matrix and linear algebra operations via Numpy effectively. LivePyxel facilitates seamless data collection and labeling, accelerating the development of AI models in experimental workflows.

      <title>SpecDiff: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Self-Speculation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature caching has recently emerged as a promising method for diffusion model acceleration. It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused by high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference process of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff} achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information, \textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing the Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model inference.</description>

      <title>VCE: Safe Autoregressive Image Generation via Visual Contrast Exploitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, autoregressive image generation models have wowed audiences with their remarkable capability in creating surprisingly realistic images. Models such as GPT-4o and LlamaGen can not only produce images that faithfully mimic renowned artistic styles like Ghibli, Van Gogh, or Picasso, but also potentially generate Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content, raising significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and ethical use. Despite these concerns, methods to safeguard autoregressive text-to-image models remain underexplored. Previous concept erasure methods, primarily designed for diffusion models that operate in denoising latent space, are not directly applicable to autoregressive models that generate images token by token. To address this critical gap, we propose Visual Contrast Exploitation (VCE), a novel framework comprising: (1) an innovative contrastive image pair construction paradigm that precisely decouples unsafe concepts from their associated content semantics, and (2) a sophisticated DPO-based training approach that enhances the model's ability to identify and leverage visual contrastive features from image pairs, enabling precise concept erasure. Our comprehensive experiments across three challenging tasks-artist style erasure, explicit content erasure, and object removal-demonstrate that our method effectively secures the model, achieving state-of-the-art results while erasing unsafe concepts and maintaining the integrity of unrelated safe concepts. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Maplebb/VCE.</description>

      <title>Bias in the Picture: Benchmarking VLMs with Social-Cue News Images and LLM-as-Judge Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text, but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender, race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models, with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and fairness-aware multimodal assessment.</description>

      <title>KV-Efficient VLA: A Method to Speed up Vision Language Models with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a unified framework for robotic perception and control, but their ability to scale to real-world, long-horizon tasks is limited by the high computational cost of attention and the large memory required for storing key-value (KV) pairs during inference, particularly when retaining historical image tokens as context. Recent methods have focused on scaling backbone architectures to improve generalization, with less emphasis on addressing inference inefficiencies essential for real-time use. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a model-agnostic memory compression approach designed to address these limitations by introducing a lightweight mechanism to selectively retain high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed-size chunks and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter the historical context according to learned utility scores. This design aims to preserve recent fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory. Based on experiments, our approach can yield an average of 24.6% FLOPs savings, 1.34x inference speedup, and 1.87x reduction in KV memory. Our method integrates seamlessly into recent VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying downstream control logic.</description>

      <title>VLCE: A Knowledge-Enhanced Framework for Image Description in Disaster Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The processes of classification and segmentation utilizing artificial intelligence play a vital role in the automation of disaster assessments. However, contemporary VLMs produce details that are inadequately aligned with the objectives of disaster assessment, primarily due to their deficiency in domain knowledge and the absence of a more refined descriptive process. This research presents the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a dedicated multimodal framework aimed at integrating external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to improve the captioning process. The objective is to produce disaster-specific descriptions that effectively convert raw visual data into actionable intelligence. VLCE utilizes two separate architectures: a CNN-LSTM model that incorporates a ResNet50 backbone, pretrained on EuroSat for satellite imagery (xBD dataset), and a Vision Transformer developed for UAV imagery (RescueNet dataset). In various architectural frameworks and datasets, VLCE exhibits a consistent advantage over baseline models such as LLaVA and QwenVL. Our optimal configuration reaches an impressive 95.33\% on InfoMetIC for UAV imagery while also demonstrating strong performance across satellite imagery. The proposed framework signifies a significant transition from basic visual classification to the generation of comprehensive situational intelligence, demonstrating immediate applicability for implementation in real-time disaster assessment systems.</description>

      <title>Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21783v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>MultiCrafter: High-Fidelity Multi-Subject Generation via Disentangled Attention and Identity-Aware Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency, and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. Existing In-Context-Learning based methods are limited by their highly coupled training paradigm. These methods attempt to achieve both high subject fidelity and multi-dimensional human preference alignment within a single training stage, relying on a single, indirect reconstruction loss, which is difficult to simultaneously satisfy both these goals. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a framework that decouples this task into two distinct training stages. First, in a pre-training stage, we introduce an explicit positional supervision mechanism that effectively resolves attention bleeding and drastically enhances subject fidelity. Second, in a post-training stage, we propose Identity-Preserving Preference Optimization, a novel online reinforcement learning framework. We feature a scoring mechanism to accurately assess multi-subject fidelity based on the Hungarian matching algorithm, which allows the model to optimize for aesthetics and prompt alignment while ensuring subject fidelity achieved in the first stage. Experiments validate that our decoupling framework significantly improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.</description>

      <title>Sim-DETR: Unlock DETR for Temporal Sentence Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2) internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Tweedie Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While diffusion models excel at generating continuous data such as images, adapting them to discrete tasks has relied on indirect approaches that either operate in continuous embedding spaces or use token masking mechanisms, both of which deviate from modeling the true discrete data distribution that can be theoretically guaranteed by Tweedie's formula. We propose in-situ Tweedie Discrete Diffusion (TDD), a framework that performs diffusion guaranteed by Tweedie's formula directly within the discrete one-hot space, hence "in-situ." Unlike prior methods that diffuse continuous embeddings or mask tokens, TDD directly corrupts one-hot vectors with Gaussian noise and performs iterative denoising through a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy objective rather than mean-squared-error reconstruction. At each denoising step, the model predicts class probabilities, applies argmax to obtain discrete predictions, converts them to one-hot vectors, and feeds them into the next iteration with progressively reduced noise. This process naturally unifies discriminative classification and generative modeling under a single framework. Experiments demonstrate that TDD achieves strong performance on both image classification and text generation tasks, with extensive ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each design component. Our work establishes a principled approach to discrete diffusion that preserves the core characteristics of diffusion models while operating natively in discrete space.</description>

      <title>ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of robust driving logic, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes and simplifies the learning task by predicting the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. This inertial reference serves as a strong physical prior, compelling the model to move beyond simple pattern-matching and instead focus its capacity on learning the necessary, context-driven deviations (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) from this default, inertially-guided path. To mitigate the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. This technique re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. On the NAVSIM v1 and v2 benchmarks, ResAD achieves state-of-the-art results of 88.8 PDMS and 85.5 EPDMS with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that ResAD significantly simplifies the learning task and improves planning performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>ImmerIris: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Off-Axis and Unconstrained Iris Recognition in Immersive Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, iris recognition is regaining prominence in immersive applications such as extended reality as a means of seamless user identification. This application scenario introduces unique challenges compared to traditional iris recognition under controlled setups, as the ocular images are primarily captured off-axis and less constrained, causing perspective distortion, intra-subject variation, and quality degradation in iris textures. Datasets capturing these challenges remain limited. This paper fills this gap by presenting a large-scale iris dataset collected via head-mounted displays, termed ImmerIris. It contains 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects, and is, to our knowledge, the largest public iris dataset to date and among the first dedicated to immersive applications. It is accompanied by a comprehensive set of evaluation protocols that benchmark recognition systems under various challenging conditions. This paper also draws attention to a shared obstacle of current recognition methods, the reliance on a pre-processing, normalization stage, which is fallible in off-axis and unconstrained setups. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free paradigm that directly learns from minimally adjusted ocular images. Despite its simplicity, it outperforms normalization-based prior arts, indicating a promising direction for robust iris recognition.</description>

      <title>DAGLFNet: Deep Feature Attention Guided Global and Local Feature Fusion for Pseudo-Image Point Cloud Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental perception systems are crucial for high-precision mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor providing accurate 3D point cloud data. Efficiently processing unstructured point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a significant challenge. In recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based representation methods have emerged to balance efficiency and performance by fusing 3D point clouds with 2D grids. However, the fundamental inconsistency between the pseudo-image representation and the original 3D information critically undermines 2D-3D feature fusion, posing a primary obstacle for coherent information fusion and leading to poor feature discriminability. This work proposes DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation framework designed to extract discriminative features. It incorporates three key components: first, a Global-Local Feature Fusion Encoding (GL-FFE) module to enhance intra-set local feature correlation and capture global contextual information; second, a Multi-Branch Feature Extraction (MB-FE) network to capture richer neighborhood information and improve the discriminability of contour features; and third, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention (FFDFA) mechanism to refine cross-channel feature fusion precision. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that DAGLFNet achieves mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores of 69.9% and 78.7% on the validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method achieves an excellent balance between accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>MSCloudCAM: Multi-Scale Context Adaptation with Convolutional Cross-Attention for Multispectral Cloud Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clouds remain a major obstacle in optical satellite imaging, limiting accurate environmental and climate analysis. To address the strong spectral variability and the large scale differences among cloud types, we propose MSCloudCAM, a novel multi-scale context adapter network with convolution based cross-attention tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud segmentation. A key contribution of MSCloudCAM is the explicit modeling of multiple complementary multi-scale context extractors. And also, rather than simply stacking or concatenating their outputs, our formulation uses one extractor's fine-resolution features and the other extractor's global contextual representations enabling dynamic, scale-aware feature selection. Building on this idea, we design a new convolution-based cross attention adapter that effectively fuses localized, detailed information with broader multi-scale context. Integrated with a hierarchical vision backbone and refined through channel and spatial attention mechanisms, MSCloudCAM achieves strong spectral-spatial discrimination. Experiments on various multisensor datatsets e.g. CloudSEN12 (Sentinel-2) and L8Biome (Landsat-8) show that MSCloudCAM outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while maintaining competitive model complexity, highlighting the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed design for large-scale Earth observation.</description>

      <title>STT-GS: Sample-Then-Transmit Edge Gaussian Splatting with Joint Client Selection and Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short) strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization (PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm. Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication costs.</description>

      <title>ReefNet: A Large scale, Taxonomically Enriched Dataset and Benchmark for Hard Coral Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets, which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and (ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and conservation.</description>

      <title>CUPID: Generative 3D Reconstruction via Joint Object and Pose Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Cupid, a generative 3D reconstruction framework that jointly models the full distribution over both canonical objects and camera poses. Our two-stage flow-based model first generates a coarse 3D structure and 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the camera pose robustly. Conditioned on this pose, a refinement stage injects pixel-aligned image features directly into the generative process, marrying the rich prior of a generative model with the geometric fidelity of reconstruction. This strategy achieves exceptional faithfulness, outperforming state-of-the-art reconstruction methods by over 3 dB PSNR and 10% in Chamfer Distance. As a unified generative model that decouples the object and camera pose, Cupid naturally extends to multi-view and scene-level reconstruction tasks without requiring post-hoc optimization or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>TokenCLIP: Token-wise Prompt Learning for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TokenCLIP.</description>

      <title>Restore Text First, Enhance Image Later: Two-Stage Scene Text Image Super-Resolution with Glyph Structure Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current image super-resolution methods show strong performance on natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce TIGER (Text-Image Guided supEr-Resolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks this trade-off through a "text-first, image-later" paradigm. TIGER explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement: it first reconstructs precise text structures and uses them to guide full-image super-resolution. This ensures high fidelity and readability. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we present the UZ-ST (UltraZoom-Scene Text) dataset, the first Chinese scene text dataset with extreme zoom. Extensive experiments show TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing readability and image quality.</description>

      <title>PRISM-Bench: A Benchmark of Puzzle-Based Visual Tasks with CoT Error Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on vision-language tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain sometimes unreliable. We introduce PRISM-Bench, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of UNet-based Architectures for Liver Tumor Segmentation in Multi-Phase Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25522v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+ with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights. Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance. ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of 0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>OmniDocLayout: Towards Diverse Document Layout Generation via Coarse-to-Fine LLM Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet, while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its generative counterpart, layout generation, remains underexplored. Distinct from traditional graphic layout design and room layout planning, document layout generation typically involves a larger number of elements per page and exhibits greater structural diversity and complexity. Currently, a major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse document layouts: academic papers with Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address this gap, we curate OmniDocLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences coherently, we introduce OmniDocLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm:1) learning universal layout principles from our dataset with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the knowledge to a specific domain with few fine-grained annotated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on multiple domains in M$^6$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code, dataset, and models will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>FOCUS: Efficient Keyframe Selection for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments. We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region. On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/FOCUS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce RefTON, a flux-based person-to-person virtual try-on framework that enhances garment realism through unpaired visual references. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on complex auxiliary inputs such as body parsing and warped mask or require finely designed extract branches to process various input conditions, RefTON streamlines the process by directly generating try-on results from a source image and a target garment, without the need for structural guidance or auxiliary components to handle diverse inputs. Moreover, inspired by human clothing selection behavior, RefTON leverages additional reference images (the target garment worn on different individuals) to provide powerful guidance for refining texture alignment and maintaining the garment details. To enable this capability, we built a dataset containing unpaired reference images for training. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that RefTON achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining a simple and efficient person-to-person design.</description>

      <title>UniREditBench: A Unified Reasoning-based Image Editing Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal generative models have driven substantial improvements in image editing. However, current generative models still struggle with handling diverse and complex image editing tasks that require implicit reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess their performance across various reasoning scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-object attribute transformation in realistic scenarios, which, while effective, encounter two key challenges: (1) they largely overlook multi-object interactions as well as game-world scenarios that involve human-defined rules, which are common in real-life applications; (2) they only rely on textual references to evaluate the generated images, potentially leading to systematic misjudgments, especially in complex reasoning scenarios. To this end, this work proposes UniREditBench, a unified benchmark for reasoning-based image editing evaluation. It comprises 2,700 meticulously curated samples, covering both real- and game-world scenarios across 8 primary dimensions and 18 sub-dimensions. To improve evaluation reliability, we introduce multimodal dual-reference evaluation, providing both textual and ground-truth image references for each sample assessment. Furthermore, we design an automated multi-scenario data synthesis pipeline and construct UniREdit-Data-100K, a large-scale synthetic dataset with high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning annotations. We fine-tune Bagel on this dataset and develop UniREdit-Bagel, demonstrating substantial improvements in both in-domain and out-of-distribution settings. Through thorough benchmarking of both open-source and closed-source image editing models, we reveal their strengths and weaknesses across various aspects.</description>

      <title>Pressure2Motion: Hierarchical Human Motion Reconstruction from Ground Pressure with Text Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that reconstructs human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. At inference time, Pressure2Motion requires only a pressure mat, eliminating the need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminacy of pressure signals with respect to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint to resolve ambiguities. Specifically, our model adopts a dual-level feature extractor to accurately interpret pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion estimation with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion reconstruction, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this novel motion capture task. Experiments show that our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible motions, establishing a new state of the art for this task. The codes and benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an explicit scene representation technique, has shown significant promise for dynamic novel-view synthesis from monocular video input. However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization. Experiments on a custom physics-driven dataset as well as on standard synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant gains in physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment from LDCT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Otter: Mitigating Background Distractions of Wide-Angle Few-Shot Action Recognition with Enhanced RWKV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06741v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wide-angle videos in few-shot action recognition (FSAR) effectively express actions within specific scenarios. However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance. Extra evaluation on the VideoBadminton dataset further validates the superiority of Otter in wide-angle FSAR.</description>

      <title>AirCopBench: A Benchmark for Multi-drone Collaborative Embodied Perception and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.</description>

      <title>Algorithms Trained on Normal Chest X-rays Can Predict Health Insurance Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.</description>

      <title>GraphPilot: Grounded Scene Graph Conditioning for Language-Based Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.</description>

      <title>ImAgent: A Unified Multimodal Agent Framework for Test-Time Scalable Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.</description>

      <title>HiGFA: Hierarchical Guidance for Fine-grained Data Augmentation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models show promise for data augmentation. However, applying them to fine-grained tasks presents a significant challenge: ensuring synthetic images accurately capture the subtle, category-defining features critical for high fidelity. Standard approaches, such as text-based Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), often lack the required specificity, potentially generating misleading examples that degrade fine-grained classifier performance. To address this, we propose Hierarchically Guided Fine-grained Augmentation (HiGFA). HiGFA leverages the temporal dynamics of the diffusion sampling process. It employs strong text and transformed contour guidance with fixed strengths in the early-to-mid sampling stages to establish overall scene, style, and structure. In the final sampling stages, HiGFA activates a specialized fine-grained classifier guidance and dynamically modulates the strength of all guidance signals based on prediction confidence. This hierarchical, confidence-driven orchestration enables HiGFA to generate diverse yet faithful synthetic images by intelligently balancing global structure formation with precise detail refinement. Experiments on several FGVC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGFA.</description>

      <title>CoordAR: One-Reference 6D Pose Estimation of Novel Objects via Autoregressive Coordinate Map Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object 6D pose estimation, a crucial task for robotics and augmented reality applications, becomes particularly challenging when dealing with novel objects whose 3D models are not readily available. To reduce dependency on 3D models, recent studies have explored one-reference-based pose estimation, which requires only a single reference view instead of a complete 3D model. However, existing methods that rely on real-valued coordinate regression suffer from limited global consistency due to the local nature of convolutional architectures and face challenges in symmetric or occluded scenarios owing to a lack of uncertainty modeling. We present CoordAR, a novel autoregressive framework for one-reference 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. CoordAR formulates 3D-3D correspondences between the reference and query views as a map of discrete tokens, which is obtained in an autoregressive and probabilistic manner. To enable accurate correspondence regression, CoordAR introduces 1) a novel coordinate map tokenization that enables probabilistic prediction over discretized 3D space; 2) a modality-decoupled encoding strategy that separately encodes RGB appearance and coordinate cues; and 3) an autoregressive transformer decoder conditioned on both position-aligned query features and the partially generated token sequence. With these novel mechanisms, CoordAR significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks and demonstrates strong robustness to symmetry, occlusion, and other challenges in real-world tests.</description>

      <title>Minimax Multi-Target Conformal Prediction with Applications to Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ill-posed imaging inverse problems, uncertainty quantification remains a fundamental challenge, especially in safety-critical applications. Recently, conformal prediction has been used to quantify the uncertainty that the inverse problem contributes to downstream tasks like image classification, image quality assessment, fat mass quantification, etc. While existing works handle only a scalar estimation target, practical applications often involve multiple targets. In response, we propose an asymptotically minimax approach to multi-target conformal prediction that provides tight prediction intervals while ensuring joint marginal coverage. We then outline how our minimax approach can be applied to multi-metric blind image quality assessment, multi-task uncertainty quantification, and multi-round measurement acquisition. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the benefits of our minimax method, relative to existing multi-target conformal prediction methods, using both synthetic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Code is available at https://github.com/jwen307/multi_target_minimax.</description>

      <title>Alpha Divergence Losses for Biometric Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performance in face and speaker verification is largely driven by margin-based softmax losses such as CosFace and ArcFace. Recently introduced $\alpha$-divergence loss functions offer a compelling alternative, particularly due to their ability to induce sparse solutions (when $\alpha&gt;1$). However, integrating an angular margin-crucial for verification tasks-is not straightforward. We find that this integration can be achieved in at least two distinct ways: via the reference measure (prior probabilities) or via the logits (unnormalized log-likelihoods). In this paper, we explore both pathways, deriving two novel margin-based $\alpha$-divergence losses: Q-Margin (margin in the reference measure) and A3M (margin in the logits). We identify and address a training instability in A3M-caused by sparsity-with a simple yet effective prototype re-initialization strategy. Our methods achieve significant performance gains on the challenging IJB-B and IJB-C face verification benchmarks. We demonstrate similarly strong performance in speaker verification on VoxCeleb. Crucially, our models significantly outperform strong baselines at low false acceptance rates (FAR). This capability is critical for practical high-security applications, such as banking authentication, when minimizing false authentications is paramount. Finally, the sparsity of $\alpha$-divergence-based posteriors enables memory-efficient training, which is crucial for datasets with millions of identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}. By splitting input features, CCFFN improves parameter and FLOP efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that our \emph{CViT-XL} model achieves 75.5\% Top-1 accuracy while reducing FLOPs by 15\% and energy consumption by 3.3\% compared to EfficientViT-M5. Across various model sizes, the CViT family consistently exhibits the lowest energy consumption, making it suitable for deployment on battery-constrained devices such as mobile phones and drones. Furthermore, when evaluated using a new metric called \emph{Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF)}, which quantifies compute efficiency relative to accuracy, CViT models consistently achieve top-ranking efficiency. Particularly, CViT-L is 2.2\% more accurate than EfficientViT-M2 while having comparable APF scores.</description>

      <title>AdaTok: Adaptive Token Compression with Object-Aware Representations for Efficient Multimodal LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.</description>

      <title>InstantViR: Real-Time Video Inverse Problem Solver with Distilled Diffusion Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/infinite0522/GST.</description>

      <title>Fusing Biomechanical and Spatio-Temporal Features for Fall Prediction: Characterizing and Mitigating the Simulation-to-Reality Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as 'intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.</description>

      <title>Reasoning via Video: The First Evaluation of Video Models' Reasoning Abilities through Maze-Solving Tasks</title>

Abstract: Video Models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity video generation with coherent motion dynamics. Analogous to the development from text generation to text-based reasoning in language modeling, the development of video models motivates us to ask: Can video models reason via video generation? Compared with the discrete text corpus, video grounds reasoning in explicit spatial layouts and temporal continuity, which serves as an ideal substrate for spatial reasoning. In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>CompTrack: Information Bottleneck-Guided Low-Rank Dynamic Token Compression for Point Cloud Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D single object tracking (SOT) in LiDAR point clouds is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous driving. Despite great success having been achieved, the inherent sparsity of point clouds introduces a dual-redundancy challenge that limits existing trackers: (1) vast spatial redundancy from background noise impairs accuracy, and (2) informational redundancy within the foreground hinders efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that CompTrack achieves top-performing tracking performance with superior efficiency, running at a real-time 90 FPS on a single RTX 3090 GPU.</description>

      <title>The SA-FARI Dataset: Segment Anything in Footage of Animals for Recognition and Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated video analysis is critical for wildlife conservation. A foundational task in this domain is multi-animal tracking (MAT), which underpins applications such as individual re-identification and behavior recognition. However, existing datasets are limited in scale, constrained to a few species, or lack sufficient temporal and geographical diversity - leaving no suitable benchmark for training general-purpose MAT models applicable across wild animal populations. To address this, we introduce SA-FARI, the largest open-source MAT dataset for wild animals. It comprises 11,609 camera trap videos collected over approximately 10 years (2014-2024) from 741 locations across 4 continents, spanning 99 species categories. Each video is exhaustively annotated culminating in ~46 hours of densely annotated footage containing 16,224 masklet identities and 942,702 individual bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and species labels. Alongside the task-specific annotations, we publish anonymized camera trap locations for each video. Finally, we present comprehensive benchmarks on SA-FARI using state-of-the-art vision-language models for detection and tracking, including SAM 3, evaluated with both species-specific and generic animal prompts. We also compare against vision-only methods developed specifically for wildlife analysis. SA-FARI is the first large-scale dataset to combine high species diversity, multi-region coverage, and high-quality spatio-temporal annotations, offering a new foundation for advancing generalizable multianimal tracking in the wild. The dataset is available at https://www.conservationxlabs.com/sa-fari.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Multi-modal Medical Diagnosis with Demonstration Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.</description>

      <title>When Alignment Fails: Multimodal Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.</description>

      <title>Upsample Anything: A Simple and Hard to Beat Baseline for Feature Upsampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling. \textbf{Project page:} \href{https://seominseok0429.github.io/Upsample-Anything/}{https://seominseok0429.github.io/Upsample-Anything/}</description>

      <title>Video-as-Answer: Predict and Generate Next Video Event with Joint-GRPO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized dual-person portrait customization has considerable potential applications, such as preserving emotional memories and facilitating wedding photography planning. However, the absence of a benchmark dataset hinders the pursuit of high-quality customization in dual-person portrait generation. In this paper, we propose the PairHuman dataset, which is the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for generating dual-person portraits that meet high photographic standards. The PairHuman dataset contains more than 100K images that capture a variety of scenes, attire, and dual-person interactions, along with rich metadata, including detailed image descriptions, person localization, human keypoints, and attribute tags. We also introduce DHumanDiff, which is a baseline specifically crafted for dual-person portrait generation that features enhanced facial consistency and simultaneously balances in personalized person generation and semantic-driven scene creation. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our dataset and method produce highly customized portraits with superior visual quality that are tailored to human preferences. Our dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/annaoooo/PairHuman.</description>

      <title>REArtGS++: Generalizable Articulation Reconstruction with Temporal Geometry Constraint via Planar Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Articulated objects are pervasive in daily environments, such as drawers and refrigerators. Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

      <title>ReBrain: Brain MRI Reconstruction from Sparse CT Slice via Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in daily environments, and their 3D reconstruction holds great significance across various fields. However, existing articulated object reconstruction methods typically require costly inputs such as multi-stage and multi-view observations. To address the limitations, we propose a category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework via planar Gaussian Splatting, which only uses sparse-view RGB images from a single state. Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Moreover, we introduce a part segmentation probability for each Gaussian primitive and update them by back-projecting part segmentation masks of renderings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data than existing methods. Codes will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Preventing Shortcut Learning in Medical Image Analysis through Intermediate Layer Knowledge Distillation from Specialist Teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.</description>

      <title>Advancing Autonomous Driving: DepthSense with Radar and Spatial Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.05265v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depth perception is crucial for spatial understanding and has traditionally been achieved through stereoscopic imaging. However, the precision of depth estimation using stereoscopic methods depends on the accurate calibration of binocular vision sensors. Monocular cameras, while more accessible, often suffer from reduced accuracy, especially under challenging imaging conditions. Optical sensors, too, face limitations in adverse environments, leading researchers to explore radar technology as a reliable alternative. Although radar provides coarse but accurate signals, its integration with fine-grained monocular camera data remains underexplored. In this research, we propose DepthSense, a novel radar-assisted monocular depth enhancement approach. DepthSense employs an encoder-decoder architecture, a Radar Residual Network, feature fusion with a spatial attention mechanism, and an ordinal regression layer to deliver precise depth estimations. We conducted extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset to validate the effectiveness of DepthSense. Our methodology not only surpasses existing approaches in quantitative performance but also reduces parameter complexity and inference times. Our findings demonstrate that DepthSense represents a significant advancement over traditional stereo methods, offering a robust and efficient solution for depth estimation in autonomous driving. By leveraging the complementary strengths of radar and monocular camera data, DepthSense sets a new benchmark in the field, paving the way for more reliable and accurate spatial perception systems.</description>

      <title>FCDM: A Physics-Guided Bidirectional Frequency Aware Convolution and Diffusion-Based Model for Sinogram Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06714v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in scientific imaging systems such as synchrotron and laboratory-based nano-CT, but acquiring full-view sinograms requires high radiation dose and long scan times. Sparse-view CT alleviates this burden but yields incomplete sinograms with structured signal loss, hampering accurate reconstruction. Unlike RGB images, sinograms encode overlapping features along projection paths and exhibit distinct directional spectral patterns, which make conventional RGB-oriented inpainting approaches--including diffusion models--ineffective for sinogram restoration, as they disregard the angular dependencies and physical constraints inherent to tomographic data. To overcome these limitations, we propose FCDM, a diffusion-based framework tailored for sinograms, which restores global structure through bidirectional frequency reasoning and angular-aware masking, while enforcing physical plausibility via physics-guided constraints and frequency-adaptive noise control. Experiments on real-world datasets show that FCDM consistently outperforms baselines, achieving SSIM over 0.93 and PSNR above 31 dB across diverse sparse-view scenarios.</description>

      <title>RN-SDEs: Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction with Residual Null-Space Diffusion Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography is a widely used imaging modality with applications ranging from medical imaging to material analysis. One major challenge arises from the lack of scanning information at certain angles, resulting in distortion or artifacts in the reconstructed images. This is referred to as the Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) reconstruction problem. To address this problem, we propose the use of Residual Null-Space Diffusion Stochastic Differential Equations (RN-SDEs), which are a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion process with mean-reverting (MR) stochastic differential equations. To demonstrate the generalizability of RN-SDEs, we conducted experiments with two different LACT datasets, ChromSTEM and C4KC-KiTS. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that by leveraging learned MR-SDEs as a prior and emphasizing data consistency using Range-Null Space Decomposition (RNSD) based rectification, we can recover high-quality images from severely degraded ones and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most LACT tasks. Additionally, we present a quantitative comparison of RN-SDE with other networks, in terms of computational complexity and runtime efficiency, highlighting the superior effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>AsynEIO: Asynchronous Monocular Event-Inertial Odometry Using Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras, when combined with inertial sensors, show significant potential for motion estimation in challenging scenarios, such as high-speed maneuvers and low-light environments. There are many methods for producing such estimations, but most boil down to a synchronous discrete-time fusion problem. However, the asynchronous nature of event cameras and their unique fusion mechanism with inertial sensors remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a monocular event-inertial odometry method called AsynEIO, designed to fuse asynchronous event and inertial data within a unified Gaussian Process (GP) regression framework. Our approach incorporates an event-driven frontend that tracks feature trajectories directly from raw event streams at a high temporal resolution. These tracked feature trajectories, along with various inertial factors, are integrated into the same GP regression framework to enable asynchronous fusion. With deriving analytical residual Jacobians and noise models, our method constructs a factor graph that is iteratively optimized and pruned using a sliding-window optimizer. Comparative assessments highlight the performance of different inertial fusion strategies, suggesting optimal choices for varying conditions. Experimental results on both public datasets and our own event-inertial sequences indicate that AsynEIO outperforms existing methods, especially in high-speed and low-illumination scenarios.</description>

      <title>DiffBreak: Is Diffusion-Based Purification Robust?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16598v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) has become a cornerstone defense against adversarial examples (AEs), regarded as robust due to its use of diffusion models (DMs) that project AEs onto the natural data manifold. We refute this core claim, theoretically proving that gradient-based attacks effectively target the DM rather than the classifier, causing DBP's outputs to align with adversarial distributions. This prompts a reassessment of DBP's robustness, accrediting it two critical factors: inaccurate gradients and improper evaluation protocols that test only a single random purification of the AE. We show that when accounting for stochasticity and resubmission risk, DBP collapses. To support this, we introduce DiffBreak, the first reliable toolkit for differentiation through DBP, eliminating gradient mismatches that previously further inflated robustness estimates. We also analyze the current defense scheme used for DBP where classification relies on a single purification, pinpointing its inherent invalidity. We provide a statistically grounded majority-vote (MV) alternative that aggregates predictions across multiple purified copies, showing partial but meaningful robustness gain. We then propose a novel adaptation of an optimization method against deepfake watermarking, crafting systemic perturbations that defeat DBP even under MV, challenging DBP's viability.</description>

      <title>Systematic Reward Gap Optimization for Mitigating VLM Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17265v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in mitigating hallucinations in Vision Language Models (VLMs) critically hinges on the true reward gaps within preference pairs. However, current methods, typically relying on ranking or rewriting strategies, often struggle to optimize these reward gaps in a systematic way during data curation. A core difficulty lies in precisely characterizing and strategically manipulating the overall reward gap configuration, that is, the deliberate design of how to shape these reward gaps within each preference pair across the data. To address this, we introduce Topic-level Preference Rewriting(TPR), a novel framework designed for the systematic optimization of reward gap configuration. Through selectively replacing semantic topics within VLM responses with model's own resampled candidates for targeted rewriting, TPR can provide topic-level control over fine-grained semantic details. This precise control enables advanced data curation strategies, such as progressively adjusting the difficulty of rejected responses, thereby sculpting an effective reward gap configuration that guides the model to overcome challenging hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate TPR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple hallucination benchmarks, outperforming previous methods by an average of 20%. Notably, it significantly reduces hallucinations by up to 93% on ObjectHal-Bench, and also exhibits superior data efficiency towards robust and cost-effective VLM alignment.

      <title>MeshCone: Second-Order Cone Programming for Geometrically-Constrained Mesh Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern geometric generation methods rely heavily on deep learning methods that, while powerful, often lack interpretability and require extensive training data. This work introduces MeshCone, a convex optimization framework for mesh enhancement from partially deformed meshes that requires no training data. We formulate the problem as a second-order cone program where vertex positions are optimized to align with target geometry while enforcing smoothness through convex edge-length regularization. Our convex relaxation enables deterministic, interpretable solutions with proven convergence properties via the Splitting Conic Solver (SCS). We demonstrate robust performance across 56 diverse object categories from ShapeNet and ThreeDScans, achieving superior refinement quality compared to classical baselines while maintaining sub-second inference times. This work establishes a principled baseline demonstrating what convex optimization alone can achieve, providing mathematical guarantees and interpretability that complement data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Full-scale Representation Guided Network for Retinal Vessel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The U-Net architecture and its variants have remained state-of-the-art (SOTA) for retinal vessel segmentation over the past decade. In this study, we introduce a Full-Scale Guided Network (FSG-Net), where a novel feature representation module using modernized convolution blocks effectively captures full-scale structural information, while a guided convolution block subsequently refines this information. Specifically, we introduce an attention-guided filter within the guided convolution block, leveraging its similarity to unsharp masking to enhance fine vascular structures. Passing full-scale information to the attention block facilitates the generation of more contextually relevant attention maps, which are then passed to the attention-guided filter, providing further refinement to the segmentation performance. The structure preceding the guided convolution block can be replaced by any U-Net variant, ensuring flexibility and scalability across various segmentation tasks. For a fair comparison, we re-implemented recent studies available in public repositories to evaluate their scalability and reproducibility. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite its compact architecture, FSG-Net delivers performance competitive with SOTA methods across multiple public datasets. Ablation studies further demonstrate that each proposed component meaningfully contributes to this competitive performance. Our code is available on https://github.com/ZombaSY/FSG-Net-pytorch.</description>

      <title>Resilient Contrastive Pre-training under Non-Stationary Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale contrastive pre-training has been largely driven by by vast yet static datasets. However, as the scaling paradigm evolves, this paradigm encounters a fundamental challenge when applied to dynamic data streams characterized by concept drift - unpredictable changes in the underlying data distribution. This paper aims to advance robust pre-training under such non-stationary environments. We begin by revealing that conventional contrastive pre-training methods are highly susceptible to concept drift, resulting in significant substantial bias and instability within the learned feature representations. To systematically analyze these effects, we develop a structural causal model that elucidates how drift acts as a confounder, distorting the learned representations. Based on these causal insights, we propose Resilient Contrastive Pre-training (RCP), a novel method that incorporates causal intervention. RCP formulates a causally-informed objective to mitigate drift-induced biases through targeted interventions. The method is designed for simple and scalable implementation and exhibits notable adaptability, promoting robust and autonomous pre-training on non-stationary data. Comprehensive experiments across various downstream tasks consistently demonstrate that RCP effectively alleviates the detrimental impact of concept drift, yielding more resilient and generalizable representations.</description>

      <title>Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13837v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulation is essential for robotics research, enabling safe and efficient testing of perception, control, and navigation algorithms. However, achieving both photorealistic rendering and accurate physics modeling remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel simulation framework, the Unreal Robotics Lab (URL), that integrates the advanced rendering capabilities of the Unreal Engine with MuJoCo's high-precision physics simulation. Our approach enables realistic robotic perception while maintaining accurate physical interactions, facilitating benchmarking and dataset generation for vision-based robotics applications. The system supports complex environmental effects, such as smoke, fire, and water dynamics, which are critical to evaluating robotic performance under adverse conditions. We benchmark visual navigation and SLAM methods within our framework, demonstrating its utility for testing real-world robustness in controlled yet diverse scenarios. By bridging the gap between physics accuracy and photorealistic rendering, our framework provides a powerful tool for advancing robotics research and sim-to-real transfer. Our open-source framework is available at https://unrealroboticslab.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing broadly generalizable visual navigation policies for robots is a significant challenge, primarily constrained by the availability of large-scale, diverse training data. While curated datasets collected by researchers offer high quality, their limited size restricts policy generalization. To overcome this, we explore leveraging abundant, passively collected data sources, including large volumes of crowd-sourced teleoperation data and unlabeled YouTube videos, despite their potential for lower quality or missing action labels. We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework that utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or generate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data is then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on visual goals or GPS waypoints. We demonstrate that LogoNav, trained using MBRA-processed data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust navigation over distances exceeding 300 meters in previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. Our extensive real-world evaluations, conducted across a fleet of robots (including quadrupeds) in six cities on three continents, validate the policy's ability to generalize and navigate effectively even amidst pedestrians in crowded settings.</description>

      <title>Spatial Knowledge Graph-Guided Multimodal Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities; however, their spatial perception abilities remain a notable limitation. To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. Our approach addresses this critical gap by providing a systematic framework for generating spatially coherent data. In this work, we introduce SKG2DATA, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2DATA employs an automated pipeline for constructing Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) that effectively captures human-like spatial cognition, including directional and distance relationships. These structured representations then serve as precise guidance for our integrated synthesis pipeline, where a diffusion model generates spatially-consistent images while a MLLM produces corresponding textual descriptions. The automated construction of SKG enables scalable generation of diverse yet realistic spatial configurations, overcoming the limitations of manual data collection and annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs markedly, albeit with a slight cost to their general capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/Knowledge2Data.</description>

      <title>DriveSuprim: Towards Precise Trajectory Selection for End-to-End Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must navigate safely in complex driving environments. Imitating a single expert trajectory, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each. However, they face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of candidates and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare and challenging scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, with 83.02 Driving Score and 60.00 Success Rate on the Bench2Drive benchmark, demonstrating superior planning capabilities in various driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Athena: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Data-efficient Process Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Evo-0: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit Spatial Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale image and text pretraining. However, existing VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates additional depth sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, which may yield defective results. In contrast, our work introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly incorporates 3D geometry features into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation model. This integration provides the model with depth-aware visual representations, improving its ability to understand the geometric structure of the scene and the spatial relationships among objects from RGB images alone. We evaluate our method on a set of spatially challenging tasks in both simulation and the real world. Extensive evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Target-based Multi-LiDAR Multi-Camera Extrinsic Calibration System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extrinsic Calibration represents the cornerstone of autonomous driving. Its accuracy plays a crucial role in the perception pipeline, as any errors can have implications for the safety of the vehicle. Modern sensor systems collect different types of data from the environment, making it harder to align the data. To this end, we propose a target-based extrinsic calibration system tailored for a multi-LiDAR and multi-camera sensor suite. This system enables cross-calibration between LiDARs and cameras with limited prior knowledge using a custom ChArUco board and a tailored nonlinear optimization method. We test the system with real-world data gathered in a warehouse. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting the feasibility of a unique pipeline tailored for various types of sensors.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Cortical Computation: Manifold Disentanglement and Predictive Dynamics in VCNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their success, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Learning to See and Act: Task-Aware Virtual View Exploration for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders, which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and generalization. In this work, we propose Task-aware Virtual View Exploration (TVVE), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating virtual view exploration with task-specific representation learning. TVVE employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Task-aware Mixture-of-Experts (TaskMoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TVVE generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. To further validate the robustness and generalization capability of TVVE under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, we construct a challenging benchmark, RLBench-OG, covering various visual perturbations and camera pose variations. Extensive experiments on RLBench and RLBench-OG show that our TVVE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. In real-robot experiments, TVVE demonstrates exceptional performance and generalizes robustly in multiple OOD settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions.

      <title>Don't Reach for the Stars: Rethinking Topology for Resilient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local. Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across five datasets shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both, centralized baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance, particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.</description>

      <title>MeteorPred: A Meteorological Multimodal Large Model and Dataset for Severe Weather Event Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timely and accurate forecasts of severe weather events are essential for early warning and for constraining downstream analysis and decision-making. Since severe weather events prediction still depends on subjective, time-consuming expert interpretation, end-to-end "AI weather station" systems are emerging but face three major challenges: (1) scarcity of severe weather event samples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data and textual warnings; (3) current multimodal language models cannot effectively process high-dimensional meteorological inputs or capture their complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for severe weather events prediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and corresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios. On top of this dataset, we develop a Meteorology Multimodal Large Model (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data flow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable dynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical pressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench show that MMLM achieves strong performance across multiple tasks, demonstrating effective severe weather understanding and representing a key step toward automated, AI-driven severe weather events forecasting systems. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained GRPO for Precise Preference Alignment in Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The incorporation of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow-based generative models has recently gained attention as a powerful paradigm for aligning model behavior with human preferences. By leveraging stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) during the denoising phase, these models can explore a variety of denoising trajectories, enhancing the exploratory capacity of RL. However, despite their ability to discover potentially high-reward samples, current approaches often struggle to effectively align with preferences due to the sparsity and narrowness of reward feedback. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel framework called Granular-GRPO (G$^2$RPO), which enables fine-grained and comprehensive evaluation of sampling directions in the RL training of flow models. Specifically, we propose a Singular Stochastic Sampling mechanism that supports step-wise stochastic exploration while ensuring strong correlation between injected noise and reward signals, enabling more accurate credit assignment to each SDE perturbation. Additionally, to mitigate the bias introduced by fixed-granularity denoising, we design a Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages computed across multiple diffusion scales, resulting in a more robust and holistic assessment of sampling trajectories. Extensive experiments on various reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrate that our G$^2$RPO outperforms existing flow-based GRPO baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>"It's trained by non-disabled people": Evaluating How Image Quality Affects Product Captioning with VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used by blind and low-vision (BLV) people to identify and understand products in their everyday lives, such as food, personal products, and household goods. Despite their prevalence, we lack an empirical understanding of how common image quality issues, like blur and misframing of items, affect the accuracy of VLM-generated captions and whether resulting captions meet BLV people's information needs. Grounded in a survey with 86 BLV people, we systematically evaluate how image quality issues affect captions generated by VLMs. We show that the best model recognizes products in images with no quality issues with 98% accuracy, but drops to 75% accuracy overall when quality issues are present, worsening considerably as issues compound. We discuss the need for model evaluations that center on disabled people's experiences throughout the process and offer concrete recommendations for HCI and ML researchers to make VLMs more reliable for BLV people.</description>

      <title>Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni: Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Large Model with Advanced MoE, Training and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Uni-MoE 2.0 from the Lychee family. As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</description>

      <title>OmniLens++: Blind Lens Aberration Correction via Large LensLib Pre-Training and Latent PSF Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib. The source code and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens2.</description>
