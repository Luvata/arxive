      <title>A Study on the Application of Artificial Intelligence in Ecological Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human dominance to genuine interdependence, and whether artificial intelligence (AI) can mediate that shift. We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI interacts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists and designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological restoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings highlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and environmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on sustainable, technology-enabled ecosystems.</description>

      <title>General Modular Harness for LLM Agents in Multi-Turn Gaming Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of perception, memory, and reasoning components, enabling a single LLM or VLM backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human experience.</description>

      <title>Let's Think in Two Steps: Mitigating Agreement Bias in MLLMs with Self-Grounded Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.</description>

      <title>Auto-Formulating Dynamic Programming Problems with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a 7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both approaches and the importance of combining them.</description>

      <title>A Parallel CPU-GPU Framework for Cost-Bounded DFS with Applications to IDA* and BTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*}, an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on performance.</description>

      <title>Aime: Towards Fully-Autonomous Multi-Agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11988v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems. However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation, assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and (3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective foundation for multi-agent collaboration.</description>

      <title>Understanding visual attention beehind bee-inspired UAV navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.</description>

      <title>Topology Enhanced MARL for Multi-Vehicle Cooperative Decision-Making of CAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL) method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions: First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow, effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

      <title>Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming: Solving POMDPs Sans Numerical Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future histories very deeply while simultaneously forcing a gradual policy update. We provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150 planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate building energy forecasting is essential, yet traditional heuristics often lack precision, while advanced models can be opaque and struggle with generalization by neglecting physical principles. This paper introduces BuildEvo, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design effective and interpretable energy prediction heuristics. Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance heuristics by systematically incorporating physical insights from building characteristics and operational data (e.g., from the Building Data Genome Project 2). Evaluations show BuildEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, offering improved generalization and transparent prediction logic. This work advances the automated design of robust, physically grounded heuristics, promoting trustworthy models for complex energy systems.</description>

      <title>Xiangqi-R1: Enhancing Spatial Strategic Reasoning in LLMs for Chinese Chess via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in spatially complex areas.</description>

      <title>A Review of Generative AI in Computer Science Education: Challenges and Opportunities in Accuracy, Authenticity, and Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper surveys the use of Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Claude, in computer science education, focusing on key aspects of accuracy, authenticity, and assessment. Through a literature review, we highlight both the challenges and opportunities these AI tools present. While Generative AI improves efficiency and supports creative student work, it raises concerns such as AI hallucinations, error propagation, bias, and blurred lines between AI-assisted and student-authored content. Human oversight is crucial for addressing these concerns. Existing literature recommends adopting hybrid assessment models that combine AI with human evaluation, developing bias detection frameworks, and promoting AI literacy for both students and educators. Our findings suggest that the successful integration of AI requires a balanced approach, considering ethical, pedagogical, and technical factors. Future research may explore enhancing AI accuracy, preserving academic integrity, and developing adaptive models that balance creativity with precision.</description>

      <title>Fairness Is Not Enough: Auditing Competence and Intersectional Bias in AI-powered Resume Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11548v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the assumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human decision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are these AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant to perform?
  This study investigates the question of competence through a two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex, contextual racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates merely for the presence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated core competence, provided a critical insight: some models that appeared unbiased were, in fact, incapable of performing a substantive evaluation, relying instead on superficial keyword matching.
  This paper introduces the "Illusion of Neutrality" to describe this phenomenon, where an apparent lack of bias is merely a symptom of a model's inability to make meaningful judgments. This study recommends that organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation framework, auditing AI hiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable competence to ensure they are both equitable and effective.</description>

      <title>An Memory-Efficient Framework for Deformable Transformer with Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions. However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2% accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with existing DAT acceleration methods.</description>

      <title>Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas. Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important, some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module, complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction.</description>

      <title>Landmark Detection for Medical Images using a General-purpose Segmentation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics, with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.</description>

      <title>Inversion-DPO: Precise and Efficient Post-Training for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

      <title>3D Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model for Whole-Body MR-to-CT Modality Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony structures and soft-tissue contrast.</description>

      <title>Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.</description>

      <title>A Model Aware AIGC Task Offloading Algorithm in IIoT Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) offers new opportunities for smart manufacturing, but it also introduces challenges related to computation-intensive tasks and low-latency demands. Traditional generative models based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time requirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can effectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature of AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher demands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing environments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC model switching for the first time. IIoT devices acted as multi-agent collaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge servers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task offloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental results show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72% increase in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model numbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is robust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.</description>

      <title>Predicting Pulmonary Hypertension in Newborns: A Multi-view VAE Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a critical condition characterized by elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular strain and heart failure. While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches. Our results show improved generalization and classification accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view learning for robust PH assessment in newborns.</description>

      <title>Expert Operational GANS: Towards Real-Color Underwater Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB, surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>Emergent Heterogeneous Swarm Control Through Hebbian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hebbian learning as a novel method for swarm robotics, enabling the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. Hebbian learning presents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies on local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for learning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of attributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules, thus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules across all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the curse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian learning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive prior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This work demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges, resulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved swarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning rules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in standard benchmarking tasks.</description>

      <title>Are Vision Foundation Models Ready for Out-of-the-Box Medical Image Registration?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial. Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM, MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure accuracy. We also publicly release our code at \href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.</description>

      <title>SurgeryLSTM: A Time-Aware Neural Model for Accurate and Explainable Length of Stay Prediction After Spine Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for predicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the benefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and Methods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model, SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data. Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85) and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based temporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM presents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in elective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal, explainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance discharge readiness and individualized patient care.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Uncertainty-Aware Virtual Sensing via Conformalized Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains a critical barrier to the safe deployment of deep learning in real-time virtual sensing, particularly in high-stakes domains where sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data are the norm. We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated, distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains. Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow, elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>What cat is that? A re-id model for feral cats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife, placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore, closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects. In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model, initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats. This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally, various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.</description>

      <title>SToFM: a Multi-scale Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells. Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data</description>

      <title>AI, Humans, and Data Science: Optimizing Roles Across Workflows and the Workforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI is transforming research. It is being leveraged to construct surveys, synthesize data, conduct analysis, and write summaries of the results. While the promise is to create efficiencies and increase quality, the reality is not always as clear cut. Leveraging our framework of Truth, Beauty, and Justice (TBJ) which we use to evaluate AI, machine learning and computational models for effective and ethical use (Taber and Timpone 1997; Timpone and Yang 2024), we consider the potential and limitation of analytic, generative, and agentic AI to augment data scientists or take on tasks traditionally done by human analysts and researchers. While AI can be leveraged to assist analysts in their tasks, we raise some warnings about push-button automation. Just as earlier eras of survey analysis created some issues when the increased ease of using statistical software allowed researchers to conduct analyses they did not fully understand, the new AI tools may create similar but larger risks. We emphasize a human-machine collaboration perspective (Daugherty and Wilson 2018) throughout the data science workflow and particularly call out the vital role that data scientists play under VUCA decision areas. We conclude by encouraging the advance of AI tools to complement data scientists but advocate for continued training and understanding of methods to ensure the substantive value of research is fully achieved by applying, interpreting, and acting upon results most effectively and ethically.</description>

      <title>Learning Representations of Event Time Series with Sparse Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection, Similarity Search, and Unsupervised Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality. They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.</description>

      <title>HCOMC: A Hierarchical Cooperative On-Ramp Merging Control Framework in Mixed Traffic Environment on Two-Lane Highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption compared with benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11623v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century, and many in the robotics community are looking for ways to contribute. This paper presents a roadmap for climate-relevant robotics research, identifying high-impact opportunities for collaboration between roboticists and experts across climate domains such as energy, the built environment, transportation, industry, land use, and Earth sciences. These applications include problems such as energy systems optimization, construction, precision agriculture, building envelope retrofits, autonomous trucking, and large-scale environmental monitoring. Critically, we include opportunities to apply not only physical robots but also the broader robotics toolkit - including planning, perception, control, and estimation algorithms - to climate-relevant problems. A central goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and climate. This work represents a collaboration between robotics researchers and domain experts in various climate disciplines, and it serves as an invitation to the robotics community to bring their expertise to bear on urgent climate priorities.</description>

      <title>MapIQ: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Map Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.</description>

      <title>Jailbreak-Tuning: Models Efficiently Learn Jailbreak Susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However, this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks, underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its capabilities.</description>

      <title>Cross-lingual Few-shot Learning for Persian Sentiment Analysis with Incremental Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research examines cross-lingual sentiment analysis using few-shot learning and incremental learning methods in Persian. The main objective is to develop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis in Persian using limited data, while getting prior knowledge from high-resource languages. To achieve this, three pre-trained multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and DistilBERT) were employed, which were fine-tuned using few-shot and incremental learning approaches on small samples of Persian data from diverse sources, including X, Instagram, Digikala, Snappfood, and Taaghche. This variety enabled the models to learn from a broad range of contexts. Experimental results show that the mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa achieved high performances, reaching 96% accuracy on Persian sentiment analysis. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining few-shot learning and incremental learning with multilingual pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>JSQA: Speech Quality Assessment with Perceptually-Inspired Contrastive Pretraining Based on JND Audio Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a high-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score (MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging for many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent variance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions have been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual factors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead to unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework that pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS prediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are then used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity information and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean LibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with audio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results suggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly improves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared against the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These findings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly contributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Rectal Cancer MRI Using Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node (LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP' achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85 +/- 0.05.

      <title>Tracing the Path to Grokking: Embeddings, Dropout, and Network Activation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grokking refers to delayed generalization in which the increase in test accuracy of a neural network occurs appreciably after the improvement in training accuracy This paper introduces several practical metrics including variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity measures, that can forecast grokking behavior. Specifically, the resilience of neural networks to noise during inference is estimated from a Dropout Robustness Curve (DRC) obtained from the variation of the accuracy with the dropout rate as the model transitions from memorization to generalization. The variance of the test accuracy under stochastic dropout across training checkpoints further exhibits a local maximum during the grokking. Additionally, the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while the embeddings tend to a bimodal distribution independent of initialization that correlates with the observed cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries. These metrics additionally provide valuable insight into the origin and behaviour of grokking.</description>

      <title>Counting Answer Sets of Disjunctive Answer Set Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) provides a powerful declarative paradigm for knowledge representation and reasoning. Recently, counting answer sets has emerged as an important computational problem with applications in probabilistic reasoning, network reliability analysis, and other domains. This has motivated significant research into designing efficient ASP counters. While substantial progress has been made for normal logic programs, the development of practical counters for disjunctive logic programs remains challenging.
  We present SharpASP-SR, a novel framework for counting answer sets of disjunctive logic programs based on subtractive reduction to projected propositional model counting. Our approach introduces an alternative characterization of answer sets that enables efficient reduction while ensuring that intermediate representations remain of polynomial size. This allows SharpASP-SR to leverage recent advances in projected model counting technology. Through extensive experimental evaluation on diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate that SharpASP-SR significantly outperforms existing counters on instances with large answer set counts. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid counting approach that combines enumeration techniques with SharpASP-SR to achieve state-of-the-art performance across the full spectrum of disjunctive programs.</description>

      <title>Partitioner Guided Modal Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features. PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.</description>

      <title>PGT-I: Scaling Spatiotemporal GNNs with Memory-Efficient Distributed Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) are powerful tools for modeling spatial and temporal data dependencies. However, their applications have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing peak memory usage by up to 89\% and achieving up to a 13.1x speedup over standard DDP with 128 GPUs.</description>

      <title>Galaxy image simplification using Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern digital sky surveys have been acquiring images of billions of galaxies. While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them into a ``skeletonized" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available. The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of the simplified images is publicly available.</description>

      <title>ExpliCIT-QA: Explainable Code-Based Image Table Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images; (2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation, where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer; and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where auditing results are critical.</description>

      <title>Time series classification of satellite data using LSTM networks: an approach for predicting leaf-fall to minimize railroad traffic disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Railroad traffic disruption as a result of leaf-fall cost the UK rail industry over 300 million per year and measures to mitigate such disruptions are employed on a large scale, with 1.67 million kilometers of track being treated in the UK in 2021 alone. Therefore, the ability to anticipate the timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures. However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Subgraph Generation for Generalizing on Out-of-Distribution Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate high-performance on the link prediction (LP) task. However, these models often rely on all dataset samples being drawn from the same distribution. In addition, graph generative models (GGMs) show a pronounced ability to generate novel output graphs. Despite this, GGM applications remain largely limited to domain-specific tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose FLEX as a GGM framework which leverages two mechanism: (1) structurally-conditioned graph generation, and (2) adversarial co-training between an auto-encoder and GNN. As such, FLEX ensures structural-alignment between sample distributions to enhance link-prediction performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Notably, FLEX does not require expert knowledge to function in different OOD scenarios. Numerous experiments are conducted in synthetic and real-world OOD settings to demonstrate FLEX's performance-enhancing ability, with further analysis for understanding the effects of graph data augmentation on link structures. The source code is available here: https://github.com/revolins/FlexOOD.</description>

      <title>Globalization for Scalable Short-term Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various hierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of delivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local forecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in handling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem. These methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally expensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In contrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance prediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through globalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load forecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore feature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how globalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In addition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its potential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the balance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series clustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming models and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity load, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently outperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global features and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming models face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring TSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Signs: A Survey of Edge-Deployable OCR Models for Billboard Visibility Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B, InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline (PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and evaluation code publicly.</description>

      <title>CRABS: A syntactic-semantic pincer strategy for bounding LLM interpretation of Python notebooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs. The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99% identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Task-Specific Reasoning: A Unified Conditional Generative Framework for Abstract Visual Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures, which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver (UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of breakthrough artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has led to a renewed focus on how small data settings, i.e., settings with limited information, can benefit from such developments. This includes societal issues such as how best to include under-represented groups in data-driven policy and decision making, or the health benefits of assistive technologies such as wearables. We provide a conceptual overview, in particular contrasting small data with big data, and identify common themes from exemplary case studies and application areas. Potential solutions are described in a more detailed technical overview of current data analysis and modelling techniques, highlighting contributions from different disciplines, such as knowledge-driven modelling from statistics and data-driven modelling from computer science. By linking application settings, conceptual contributions and specific techniques, we highlight what is already feasible and suggest what an agenda for fully leveraging small data might look like.</description>

Abstract: Authentication and authenticity have been a security challenge since the beginning of information sharing, especially in the context of digital information. With the advancement of generative artificial intelligence, these challenges have evolved, demanding a more up-to-date analysis of their impacts on society and system security. This work presents a scoping review that analyzed 88 documents from the IEEExplorer, Scopus, and ACM databases, promoting an analysis of the resulting portfolio through six guiding questions focusing on the most relevant work, challenges, attack surfaces, threats, proposed solutions, and gaps. Finally, the portfolio articles are analyzed through this guiding research lens and also receive individualized analysis. The results consistently outline the challenges, gaps, and threats related to images, text, audio, and video, thereby supporting new research in the areas of authentication and generative artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Predicting Delayed Trajectories Using Network Features: A Study on the Dutch Railway Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays being a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology, originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for delays.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Brain Signals: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model structures.</description>

      <title>CLID-MU: Cross-Layer Information Divergence Based Meta Update Strategy for Learning with Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset, which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU). CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training. Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at https://github.com/ruofanhu/CLID-MU.</description>

      <title>Tracing Facts or just Copies? A critical investigation of the Competitions of Mechanisms in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and category-sensitive patterns.</description>

      <title>The Evolving Role of Large Language Models in Scientific Innovation: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific innovation is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). As science faces mounting challenges including information overload, disciplinary silos, and diminishing returns on conventional research methods, LLMs are emerging as powerful agents capable not only of enhancing scientific workflows but also of participating in and potentially leading the innovation process. Existing surveys mainly focus on different perspectives, phrases, and tasks in scientific research and discovery, while they have limitations in understanding the transformative potential and role differentiation of LLM. This survey proposes a comprehensive framework to categorize the evolving roles of LLMs in scientific innovation across three hierarchical levels: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist. We distinguish between LLMs' contributions to structured scientific research processes and open-ended scientific discovery, thereby offering a unified taxonomy that clarifies capability boundaries, evaluation criteria, and human-AI interaction patterns at each level. Through an extensive analysis of current methodologies, benchmarks, systems, and evaluation metrics, this survey delivers an in-depth and systematic synthesis on LLM-driven scientific innovation. We present LLMs not only as tools for automating existing processes, but also as catalysts capable of reshaping the epistemological foundations of science itself. This survey offers conceptual clarity, practical guidance, and theoretical foundations for future research, while also highlighting open challenges and ethical considerations in the pursuit of increasingly autonomous AI-driven science.

      <title>MNIST-Gen: A Modular MNIST-Style Dataset Generation Using Hierarchical Semantics, Reinforcement Learning, and Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant. Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming, legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics, enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes: individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\textit{Tree-MNIST} and \textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\% automatic categorization accuracy and 80\% time savings compared to manual approaches.</description>

      <title>Interactive Hybrid Rice Breeding with Parametric Dual Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits, such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids, which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback from breeders.</description>

      <title>From Coarse to Nuanced: Cross-Modal Alignment of Fine-Grained Linguistic Cues and Visual Salient Regions for Dynamic Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in terms of both UAR and WAR.</description>

      <title>Spatial Frequency Modulation for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures, significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

      <title>Native-AI Empowered Scalable Architectures and Solutions for Future Non-Terrestrial Networks: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the path toward 6G networks is being charted, the emerging applications have motivated evolutions of network architectures to realize the efficient, reliable, and flexible wireless networks. Among the potential architectures, the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have received increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the deployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves the resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN present new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle, hindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native artificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works propose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN deployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a holistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps lifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses the scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first provide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the state-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges that motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based NTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These include the discussion about flexible fronthaul split, RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment architecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research directions, including combinations of the ORAN-based NTN framework and other enabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are highlighted.</description>

      <title>POLYCHARTQA: Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models with Multilingual Chart Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and 26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code, allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding. Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.</description>

Abstract: We propose a low-rank adaptation method for training privacy-preserving vision transformer (ViT) models that efficiently freezes pre-trained ViT model weights. In the proposed method, trainable rank decomposition matrices are injected into each layer of the ViT architecture, and moreover, the patch embedding layer is not frozen, unlike in the case of the conventional low-rank adaptation methods. The proposed method allows us not only to reduce the number of trainable parameters but to also maintain almost the same accuracy as that of full-time tuning.</description>

      <title>RaDL: Relation-aware Disentangled Learning for Multi-Instance Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each instance within the multi-instance image.</description>

      <title>Kevin: Multi-Turn RL for Generating CUDA Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Writing GPU kernels is a challenging task and critical for AI systems' efficiency. It is also highly iterative: domain experts write code and improve performance through execution feedback. Moreover, it presents verifiable rewards like correctness and speedup, making it a natural environment to apply Reinforcement Learning (RL). To explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of this process into training, we develop a flexible multi-turn RL recipe that addresses unique challenges encountered in real-world settings, such as learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns. We present Kevin - K(ernel D)evin, the first model trained with multi-turn RL for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. In our evaluation setup, Kevin shows significant gains over its base model (QwQ-32B), improving correctness of generated kernels (in pure CUDA) from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to 1.10x of baseline (PyTorch Eager), and surpassing frontier models like o4-mini (0.78x). Finally, we study its behavior across test-time scaling axes: we found scaling serial refinement more beneficial than parallel sampling. In particular, when given more refinement turns, Kevin shows a higher rate of improvement.</description>

However, their deployment is challenging due to the substantial computational resources required. Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i) initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii) refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and $1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.</description>

      <title>Toxicity-Aware Few-Shot Prompting for Low-Resource Singlish Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech. Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP, we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.</description>

      <title>Online Training and Pruning of Deep Reinforcement Learning Networks</title>

Abstract: Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware, sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo) and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of Neural Certificates Done Dynamically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural certificates have emerged as a powerful tool in cyber-physical systems control, providing witnesses of correctness. These certificates, such as barrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified, serve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal verification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability challenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that integrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying control policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs on-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure safety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for ReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical effectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety violations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an effective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the certificates.</description>

      <title>Robust Planning for Autonomous Vehicles with Diffusion-Based Failure Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Find Fraudsters? Multi-level LLM Enhanced Graph Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

      <title>Dual form Complementary Masking for Domain-Adaptive Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for domain-adaptive segmentation.</description>

      <title>DUSE: A Data Expansion Framework for Low-resource Automatic Modulation Recognition based on Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks have made remarkable achievements in the field of automatic modulation recognition (AMR), these models often require a large amount of labeled data for training. However, in many practical scenarios, the available target domain data is scarce and difficult to meet the needs of model training. The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert annotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common method is data augmentation. Although it can enrich training samples to a certain extent, it does not introduce new data and therefore cannot fundamentally solve the problem of data scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven Sample Expansion (DUSE). Specifically, DUSE uses an uncertainty scoring function to filter out useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs an active learning strategy to continuously refine the scorer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Besides, DUSE exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models.</description>

      <title>Identifying Signatures of Image Phenotypes to Track Treatment Response in Liver Disease</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and enables a better separation between treatment groups than established non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>SS-DC: Spatial-Spectral Decoupling and Coupling Across Visible-Infrared Gap for Domain Adaptive Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID) module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids. Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on the FLIR-ADAS dataset.</description>

      <title>Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided Multi-view Novel Class Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area, existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level, we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>InstructFLIP: Exploring Unified Vision-Language Model for Face Anti-spoofing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across diverse domains in FAS.

Abstract: This submission to the binary AI detection task is based on a modular stylometric pipeline, where: public spaCy models are used for text preprocessing (including tokenisation, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and morphology annotation) and extracting several thousand features (frequencies of n-grams of the above linguistic annotations); light-gradient boosting machines are used as the classifier. We collect a large corpus of more than 500 000 machine-generated texts for the classifier's training. We explore several parameter options to increase the classifier's capacity and take advantage of that training set. Our approach follows the non-neural, computationally inexpensive but explainable approach found effective previously.</description>

      <title>BOOKCOREF: Coreference Resolution at Book Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap, we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.</description>

      <title>From Static to Intelligent: Evolving SaaS Pricing with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering flexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs. However, the rapid expansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps teams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for pricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and scale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing (iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these challenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines operational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in response to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We present an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML pricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while minimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic Information Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract essential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from SaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS, encompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However, challenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic content. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing transformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for improved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing landscape. Future research will focus on refining extraction capabilities and enhancing the system's adaptability to a wider range of SaaS websites.</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Adversarial Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Coordinated Online Behavior: Trade-offs and Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other. However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the integrity of digital platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning in Multi-Qubit Phase-Space Part I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Distributed Inference for Foundation Models at Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, from image classification to natural langurage processing, but pose significant challenges for deployment at edge. This has sparked growing interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2 across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead (up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation (51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation. This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation models in distributed resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based Decoupling Framework for low-light Stereo Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.</description>

      <title>BenchRL-QAS: Benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms for quantum architecture search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit synthesis. This work represents the most comprehensive RL-QAS benchmarking effort to date, and BenchRL-QAS along with all experimental data are made publicly available to support reproducibility and future research https://github.com/azhar-ikhtiarudin/bench-rlqas.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Ancient Beauty: Digital Reconstruction of Temple Tiles using Computer Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern digitised approaches have dramatically changed the preservation and restoration of cultural treasures, integrating computer scientists into multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and image processing with the integration of computer scientists into multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling (SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.</description>

      <title>Selective Quantization Tuning for ONNX Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues, quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the original model.</description>

      <title>Quantize More, Lose Less: Autoregressive Generation from Residually Quantized Speech Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has seen renewed progress under the discrete modeling paradigm. Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on single-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information loss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these methods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances, speaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing voice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our new audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end training of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves superior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless compression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies: the Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model inter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay Multihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to accelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive content compared to baseline. This suggests that scaling up compression via multi-codebook modeling is a promising direction for high-fidelity, general-purpose speech and audio generation.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoders for Sequential Recommendation Models: Interpretation and Flexible Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.
  This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior, providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.</description>

      <title>Draw an Ugly Person An Exploration of Generative AIs Perceptions of Ugliness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI does not only replicate human creativity but also reproduces deep-seated cultural biases, making it crucial to critically examine how concepts like ugliness are understood and expressed by these tools. This study investigates how four different generative AI models understand and express ugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these representations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through iterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across four AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes within the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our findings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old white male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical biases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups inadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes onto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite supposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional physical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs. These findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal representations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and paradoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical AI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI development.</description>

      <title>Looking for Fairness in Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday experience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries online, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of building a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social media. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several perspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the content creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating the repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern across all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes place when recommender systems are almost "too good", making recommendations so tailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of opinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's perspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's perspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of potential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are far-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political decisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation of filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape? Approaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to represent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through the lens of fairness.

      <title>Improving Contextual ASR via Multi-grained Fusion with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level components both contribute significantly to the performance gains, complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.</description>

      <title>Infherno: End-to-end Agent-based FHIR Resource Synthesis from Free-form Clinical Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular, rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding. Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues. Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data integration processes and interoperability across institutions.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Nonstationary Gaussian Processes with Neural Network Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure. Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.</description>

      <title>Site-Level Fine-Tuning with Progressive Layer Freezing: Towards Robust Prediction of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia from Day-1 Chest Radiographs in Extremely Preterm Infants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12269v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications. Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.</description>

      <title>MERA Code: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Code Generation Across Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12284v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in LLMs have enhanced task automation in software engineering; however, current evaluations primarily focus on natural language tasks, overlooking code quality. Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family, specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.</description>

      <title>Text-ADBench: Text Anomaly Detection Benchmark based on LLMs Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection, leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI (small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media, scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC). Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes all embeddings from different models and code at https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly detection systems.</description>

      <title>PROL : Rehearsal Free Continual Learning in Streaming Data via Prompt Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge, (2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model (PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput. For further study, the source code of our method is available at https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/PROL.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Descriptions: Improving Code LLMs for VHDL Code Generation and Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However, despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter, an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs for VHDL.</description>

      <title>Thought Purity: Defense Paradigm For Chain-of-Thought Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.</description>

      <title>Compositional Discrete Latent Code for High Fidelity, Productive Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12318v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is, for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.</description>

      <title>Neural Polar Decoders for Deletion Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels with a constant deletion rate. Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit high computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This limits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to short-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing NPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we extend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically, the NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating fundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support deletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational complexity of the NPD is $O(AN\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a computational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel. We evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates $\delta\in\{0.01, 0.1\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by the trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced complexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further improve performance. We believe that the extended NPD presented here could have applications in future technologies like DNA storage.</description>

      <title>Cluster Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements, CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18 backbone. By integrating contrastive learning with clustering, CueCo sets a new direction for advancing unsupervised visual representation learning.</description>

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation, where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses, they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently. FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class. Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation, overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network, FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.</description>

      <title>GitChameleon: Evaluating AI Code Generation Against Python Library Version Incompatibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of software libraries poses a considerable hurdle for code generation, necessitating continuous adaptation to frequent version updates while preserving backward compatibility. While existing code evolution benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To address this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset comprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon rigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform version-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy through execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art systems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models achieving baseline success rates in the 48-51\% range, underscoring the intricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing the dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon enables a clearer understanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more adaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and evaluation code publicly available at https://github.com/mrcabbage972/GitChameleonBenchmark.</description>

      <title>Probing for Arithmetic Errors in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.</description>

      <title>NOCTA: Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition for Longitudinal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover, temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting, and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P). Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.</description>

      <title>AutoVDC: Automated Vision Data Cleaning Using Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning) framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally, we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale production datasets in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>QuRe: Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling in Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ (HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset.

      <title>Mixture of Raytraced Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture which can dynamically select sequences of experts, producing computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the computation cycles through the experts' sequence. We train our model by iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the design of potentially faster and more expressive models.

      <title>Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Structured Enterprise and Internal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows, and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5 increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74), and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness (4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based retrieval. The source code will be released at https://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot</description>

      <title>Unit-Based Histopathology Tissue Segmentation via Multi-Level Feature Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&amp;E-stained regions, it outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset will be available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking? Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers, while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.</description>

      <title>EgoVLA: Learning Vision-Language-Action Models from Egocentric Human Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12440v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Ego Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Ego Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and ablate the importance of human data.

      <title>Characterizing State Space Model (SSM) and SSM-Transformer Hybrid Language Model Performance with Long Context Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous, long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime, accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed, device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization framework.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Config Synthesis requires Disambiguation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is ambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking context for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and ACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative priority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction. Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps, showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify, which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and can lead to different global behaviors.</description>

      <title>S2WTM: Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data, benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models (VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics while improving performance on downstream tasks.</description>

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images. A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it. Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance regulates the exercise of authority and control over the management of AI. It aims at leveraging AI through effective use of data and minimization of AI-related cost and risk. While topics such as AI governance and AI ethics are thoroughly discussed on a theoretical, philosophical, societal and regulatory level, there is limited work on AI governance targeted to companies and corporations. This work views AI products as systems, where key functionality is delivered by machine learning (ML) models leveraging (training) data. We derive a conceptual framework by synthesizing literature on AI and related fields such as ML. Our framework decomposes AI governance into governance of data, (ML) models and (AI) systems along four dimensions. It relates to existing IT and data governance frameworks and practices. It can be adopted by practitioners and academics alike. For practitioners the synthesis of mainly research papers, but also practitioner publications and publications of regulatory bodies provides a valuable starting point to implement AI governance, while for academics the paper highlights a number of areas of AI governance that deserve more attention.</description>

      <title>RACER: Rational Artificial Intelligence Car-following-model Enhanced by Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces RACER, the Rational Artificial Intelligence Car-following model Enhanced by Reality, a cutting-edge deep learning car-following model, that satisfies partial derivative constraints, designed to predict Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) driving behavior while staying theoretically feasible. Unlike conventional models, RACER effectively integrates Rational Driving Constraints (RDCs), crucial tenets of actual driving, resulting in strikingly accurate and realistic predictions. Against established models like the Optimal Velocity Relative Velocity (OVRV), a car-following Neural Network (NN), and a car-following Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), RACER excels across key metrics, such as acceleration, velocity, and spacing. Notably, it displays a perfect adherence to the RDCs, registering zero violations, in stark contrast to other models. This study highlights the immense value of incorporating physical constraints within AI models, especially for augmenting safety measures in transportation. It also paves the way for future research to test these models against human driving data, with the potential to guide safer and more rational driving behavior. The versatility of the proposed model, including its potential to incorporate additional derivative constraints and broader architectural applications, enhances its appeal and broadens its impact within the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Governance of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Companies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08802v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically large language models(LLMs) like ChatGPT, has swiftly entered organizations without adequate governance, posing both opportunities and risks. Despite extensive debates on GenAI's transformative nature and regulatory measures, limited research addresses organizational governance, encompassing technical and business perspectives. Although numerous frameworks for governance of AI exist, it is not clear to what extent they apply to GenAI. Our review paper fills this gap by surveying recent works with the purpose of better understanding fundamental characteristics of GenAI and adjusting prior frameworks specifically towards GenAI governance within companies. To do so, it extends Nickerson's framework development processes to include prior conceptualizations. Our framework outlines the scope, objectives, and governance mechanisms tailored to harness business opportunities as well as mitigate risks associated with GenAI integration. Our research contributes a focused approach to GenAI governance, offering practical insights for companies navigating the challenges of GenAI adoption and highlighting research gaps.</description>

      <title>Life, uh, Finds a Way: Hyperadaptability by Behavioral Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living beings are able to solve a wide variety of problems that they encounter rarely or only once. Without the benefit of extensive and repeated experience with these problems, they can solve them in an ad-hoc manner. We call this capacity to always find a solution to a physically solvable problem $hyperadaptability$. To explain how hyperadaptability can be achieved, we propose a theory that frames behavior as the physical manifestation of a self-modifying search procedure. Rather than exploring randomly, our system achieves robust problem-solving by dynamically ordering an infinite set of continuous behaviors according to simplicity and effectiveness. Behaviors are sampled from paths over cognitive graphs, their order determined by a tight behavior-execution/graph-modification feedback loop. We implement cognitive graphs using Hebbian-learning and a novel harmonic neural representation supporting flexible information storage. We validate our approach through simulation experiments showing rapid achievement of highly-robust navigation ability in complex mazes, as well as high reward on difficult extensions of classic reinforcement learning problems. This framework offers a new theoretical model for developmental learning and paves the way for robots that can autonomously master complex skills and handle exceptional circumstances.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Detox: Sensitivity Dropout (SenD) for Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15460v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, concerns about their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations - factually inaccurate or irrelevant outputs - have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the uncertainty in training dynamics and the emergence of hallucinations. Using models from the Pythia suite and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends and identify significant variance during training. To address this, we propose \textbf{Sensitivity Dropout (SenD)}, a novel training protocol designed to reduce hallucination variance during training by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore in 2x speed. This metric is integrated into our training protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucination variance. SenD improves test-time reliability of Pythia and Meta's Llama models by up to 17\% and enhances factual accuracy in Wikipedia, Medical, Legal, and Coding domains without affecting downstream task performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Lifted STRIPS Models from Action Traces Alone: A Simple, General, and Scalable Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning STRIPS action models from action traces alone is a challenging problem as it involves learning the domain predicates as well. In this work, a novel approach is introduced which, like the well-known LOCM systems, is scalable, but like SAT approaches, is sound and complete. Furthermore, the approach is general and imposes no restrictions on the hidden domain or the number or arity of the predicates. The new learning method is based on an \emph{efficient, novel test} that checks whether the assumption that a predicate is affected by a set of action patterns, namely, actions with specific argument positions, is consistent with the traces. The predicates and action patterns that pass the test provide the basis for the learned domain that is then easily completed with preconditions and static predicates. The new method is studied theoretically and experimentally. For the latter, the method is evaluated on traces and graphs obtained from standard classical domains like the 8-puzzle, which involve hundreds of thousands of states and transitions. The learned representations are then verified on larger instances.</description>

      <title>Proactive Agents for Multi-Turn Text-to-Image Generation Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading to a misalignment between the user intent and models' understanding. As a result, users commonly have to painstakingly refine their prompts. We study this alignment problem in text-to-image (T2I) generation and propose a prototype for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their uncertainty about user intent as an understandable and editable belief graph. We build simple prototypes for such agents and propose a new scalable and automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth intent (an image) while the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. We experiment over three image-text datasets: ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and DesignBench, a benchmark we curated with strong artistic and design elements. Experiments over the three datasets demonstrate the proposed T2I agents' ability to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard T2I generation. Moreover, we conducted human studies and observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Code and DesignBench can be found at https://github.com/google-deepmind/proactive_t2i_agents.</description>

      <title>Generative Emergent Communication: Large Language Model is a Collective World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture extensive world knowledge, yet how this is achieved without direct sensorimotor experience remains a fundamental puzzle. This study proposes a novel theoretical solution by introducing the Collective World Model hypothesis. We argue that an LLM does not learn a world model from scratch; instead, it learns a statistical approximation of a collective world model that is already implicitly encoded in human language through a society-wide process of embodied, interactive sense-making. To formalize this process, we introduce generative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence of language as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internal states of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates an encoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectively encodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLM subsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrors the structure of the original collective representations. This perspective provides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire their capabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization of the Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models and multi-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs, explaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequence of representation reconstruction. This work provides a unified theory that bridges individual cognitive development, collective language evolution, and the foundations of large-scale AI.</description>

Abstract: Policymakers increasingly use development cost and compute as proxies for AI capabilities and risks. Recent laws have introduced regulatory requirements that are contingent on specific thresholds. However, technical ambiguities in how to perform this accounting create loopholes that can undermine regulatory effectiveness. We propose seven principles for designing AI cost and compute accounting standards that (1) reduce opportunities for strategic gaming, (2) avoid disincentivizing responsible risk mitigation, and (3) enable consistent implementation across companies and jurisdictions.</description>

      <title>System 0/1/2/3: Quad-process theory for multi-timescale embodied collective cognitive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Frontiers in LLM Reasoning: Inference Scaling, Learning to Reason, and Agentic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables logical inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...</description>

      <title>Lost in Transmission: When and Why LLMs Fail to Reason Globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.</description>

      <title>GeoChain: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought for Geographic Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&amp;A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows, Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 5%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 28.8% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. macOSWorld is available at https://github.com/showlab/macosworld.</description>

      <title>Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted arithmetic mean.

      <title>The Challenge of Teaching Reasoning to LLMs Without RL or Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20 long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However, neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain, we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.</description>

      <title>On Gradual Semantics for Assumption-Based Argumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computational argumentation, gradual semantics are fine-grained alternatives to extension-based and labelling-based semantics . They ascribe a dialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of acceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract, bipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as, to a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this has not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it being a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications where gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which are the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths. To do so, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of (potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular gradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy suitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as balance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that leverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline. Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our gradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess convergence.</description>

      <title>From Semantic Web and MAS to Agentic AI: A Unified Narrative of the Web of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static, document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users' behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model (LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open, trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance for the emerging WoA.</description>

      <title>Epic-Sounds: A Large-scale Dataset of Actions That Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce EPIC-SOUNDS, a large-scale dataset of audio annotations capturing temporal extents and class labels within the audio stream of the egocentric videos. We propose an annotation pipeline where annotators temporally label distinguishable audio segments and describe the action that could have caused this sound. We identify actions that can be discriminated purely from audio, through grouping these free-form descriptions of audio into classes. For actions that involve objects colliding, we collect human annotations of the materials of these objects (e.g. a glass object being placed on a wooden surface), which we verify from video, discarding ambiguities. Overall, EPIC-SOUNDS includes 78.4k categorised segments of audible events and actions, distributed across 44 classes as well as 39.2k non-categorised segments. We train and evaluate state-of-the-art audio recognition and detection models on our dataset, for both audio-only and audio-visual methods. We also conduct analysis on: the temporal overlap between audio events, the temporal and label correlations between audio and visual modalities, the ambiguities in annotating materials from audio-only input, the importance of audio-only labels and the limitations of current models to understand actions that sound.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Introduction to Deep Learning: Methods, Implementations, and Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book aims to provide an introduction to the topic of deep learning algorithms. We review essential components of deep learning algorithms in full mathematical detail including different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (such as fully-connected feedforward ANNs, convolutional ANNs, recurrent ANNs, residual ANNs, and ANNs with batch normalization) and different optimization algorithms (such as the basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, accelerated methods, and adaptive methods). We also cover several theoretical aspects of deep learning algorithms such as approximation capacities of ANNs (including a calculus for ANNs), optimization theory (including Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities), and generalization errors. In the last part of the book some deep learning approximation methods for PDEs are reviewed including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep Galerkin methods. We hope that this book will be useful for students and scientists who do not yet have any background in deep learning at all and would like to gain a solid foundation as well as for practitioners who would like to obtain a firmer mathematical understanding of the objects and methods considered in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Holistic analysis on the sustainability of Federated Learning across AI product lifecycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of emerging legal requirements and policies focused on privacy protection, there is a growing trend of companies across various industries adopting Federated Learning (FL). This decentralized approach involves multiple clients or silos, collaboratively training a global model under the coordination of a central server while utilizing their private local data. Unlike traditional methods that necessitate data sharing and transmission, Cross-Silo FL allows clients to share model updates rather than raw data, thereby enhancing privacy. Despite its growing adoption, the carbon impact associated with Cross-Silo FL remains poorly understood due to the limited research in this area. This study seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating the sustainability of Cross-Silo FL throughout the entire AI product lifecycle, extending the analysis beyond the model training phase alone. We systematically compare this decentralized method with traditional centralized approaches and present a robust quantitative framework for assessing the costs and CO2 emissions in real-world Cross-Silo FL environments. Our findings indicate that the energy consumption and costs of model training are comparable between Cross-Silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning. However, the additional data transfer and storage requirements inherent in Centralized Learning can result in significant, often overlooked CO2 emissions. Moreover, we introduce an innovative data and application management system that integrates Cross-Silo FL and analytics, aiming at improving the sustainability and economic efficiency of IT enterprises.</description>

      <title>Programming Distributed Collective Processes in the eXchange Calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11212v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) suggest a vision of dense and multi-scale deployments of computing devices in nearly all kinds of environments. A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Properties of Generative Adversarial Models for Low Intrinsic Data Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable empirical successes of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the theoretical guarantees for their statistical accuracy remain rather pessimistic. In particular, the data distributions on which GANs are applied, such as natural images, are often hypothesized to have an intrinsic low-dimensional structure in a typically high-dimensional feature space, but this is often not reflected in the derived rates in the state-of-the-art analyses. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of GANs and their bidirectional variant, Bi-directional GANs (BiGANs), by deriving statistical guarantees on the estimated densities in terms of the intrinsic dimension of the data and the latent space. We analytically show that if one has access to $n$ samples from the unknown target distribution and the network architectures are properly chosen, the expected Wasserstein-1 distance of the estimates from the target scales as $O\left( n^{-1/d_\mu } \right)$ for GANs and $\tilde{O}\left( n^{-1/(d_\mu+\ell)} \right)$ for BiGANs, where $d_\mu$ and $\ell$ are the upper Wasserstein-1 dimension of the data-distribution and latent-space dimension, respectively. The theoretical analyses not only suggest that these methods successfully avoid the curse of dimensionality, in the sense that the exponent of $n$ in the error rates does not depend on the data dimension but also serve to bridge the gap between the theoretical analyses of GANs and the known sharp rates from optimal transport literature. Additionally, we demonstrate that GANs can effectively achieve the minimax optimal rate even for non-smooth underlying distributions, with the use of interpolating generator networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Trust in Autonomous Agents: An Architecture for Accountability and Explainability through Blockchain and Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09567v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents in environments involving human interaction has increasingly raised security concerns. Consequently, understanding the circumstances behind an event becomes critical, requiring the development of capabilities to justify their behaviors to non-expert users. Such explanations are essential in enhancing trustworthiness and safety, acting as a preventive measure against failures, errors, and misunderstandings. Additionally, they contribute to improving communication, bridging the gap between the agent and the user, thereby improving the effectiveness of their interactions. This work presents an accountability and explainability architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution consists of two main components. Firstly, a black box-like element to provide accountability, featuring anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain technology. Secondly, a component in charge of generating natural language explanations by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) over the data contained within the previously mentioned black box. The study evaluates the performance of our solution in three different scenarios, each involving autonomous agent navigation functionalities. This evaluation includes a thorough examination of accountability and explainability metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in using accountable data from robot actions to obtain coherent, accurate and understandable explanations, even when facing challenges inherent in the use of autonomous agents in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09158v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce StreakNet-Arch, a real-time, end-to-end binary-classification framework based on our self-developed Underwater Carrier LiDAR-Radar (UCLR) that embeds Self-Attention and our novel Double Branch Cross Attention (DBC-Attention) to enhance scatter suppression. Under controlled water tank validation conditions, StreakNet-Arch with Self-Attention or DBC-Attention outperforms traditional bandpass filtering and achieves higher $F_1$ scores than learning-based MP networks and CNNs at comparable model size and complexity. Real-time benchmarks on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 show a constant Average Imaging Time (54 to 84 ms) regardless of frame count, versus a linear increase (58 to 1,257 ms) for conventional methods. To facilitate further research, we contribute a publicly available streak-tube camera image dataset contains 2,695,168 real-world underwater 3D point cloud data. More importantly, we validate our UCLR system in a South China Sea trial, reaching an error of 46mm for 3D target at 1,000 m depth and 20 m range.

      <title>Towards Understanding Link Predictor Generalizability Under Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art link prediction (LP) models demonstrate impressive benchmark results. However, popular benchmark datasets often assume that training, validation, and testing samples are representative of the overall dataset distribution. In real-world situations, this assumption is often incorrect; uncontrolled factors lead new dataset samples to come from a different distribution than training samples. Additionally, the majority of recent work with graph dataset shift focuses on node- and graph-level tasks, largely ignoring link-level tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel splitting strategy, known as LPShift, which utilizes structural properties to induce a controlled distribution shift. We verify LPShift's effect through empirical evaluation of SOTA LP models on 16 LPShift variants of original dataset splits, with results indicating drastic changes to model performance. Additional experiments demonstrate graph structure has a strong influence on the success of current generalization methods.

      <title>Linearly-Interpretable Concept Embedding Models for Text Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their success, Large-Language Models (LLMs) still face criticism due to their lack of interpretability. Traditional post-hoc interpretation methods, based on attention and gradient-based analysis, offer limited insights as they only approximate the model's decision-making processes and have been proved to be unreliable. For this reason, Concept-Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have been lately proposed in the textual field to provide interpretable predictions based on human-understandable concepts. However, CBMs still exhibit several limitations due to their architectural constraints limiting their expressivity, to the absence of task-interpretability when employing non-linear task predictors and for requiring extensive annotations that are impractical for real-world text data. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a novel Linearly Interpretable Concept Embedding Model (LICEM) going beyond the current accuracy-interpretability trade-off. LICEMs classification accuracy is better than existing interpretable models and matches black-box ones. We show that the explanations provided by our models are more interveneable and causally consistent with respect to existing solutions. Finally, we show that LICEMs can be trained without requiring any concept supervision, as concepts can be automatically predicted when using an LLM backbone.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus with Vision Transformers: the Importance of 2D Representation, Positions, and Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a popular benchmark focused on visual reasoning in the evaluation of Artificial Intelligence systems. In its original framing, an ARC task requires solving a program synthesis problem over small 2D images using a few input-output training pairs. In this work, we adopt the recently popular data-driven approach to the ARC and ask whether a Vision Transformer (ViT) can learn the implicit mapping, from input image to output image, that underlies the task. We show that a ViT -- otherwise a state-of-the-art model for images -- fails dramatically on most ARC tasks even when trained on one million examples per task. This points to an inherent representational deficiency of the ViT architecture that makes it incapable of uncovering the simple structured mappings underlying the ARC tasks. Building on these insights, we propose ViTARC, a ViT-style architecture that unlocks some of the visual reasoning capabilities required by the ARC. Specifically, we use a pixel-level input representation, design a spatially-aware tokenization scheme, and introduce a novel object-based positional encoding that leverages automatic segmentation, among other enhancements. Our task-specific ViTARC models achieve a test solve rate close to 100% on more than half of the 400 public ARC tasks strictly through supervised learning from input-output grids. This calls attention to the importance of imbuing the powerful (Vision) Transformer with the correct inductive biases for abstract visual reasoning that are critical even when the training data is plentiful and the mapping is noise-free. Hence, ViTARC provides a strong foundation for future research in visual reasoning using transformer-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Distilling Invariant Representations with Dual Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09474v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely used to transfer knowledge from large, accurate models (teachers) to smaller, efficient ones (students). Recent methods have explored enforcing consistency by incorporating causal interpretations to distill invariant representations. In this work, we extend this line of research by introducing a dual augmentation strategy to promote invariant feature learning in both teacher and student models. Our approach leverages different augmentations applied to both models during distillation, pushing the student to capture robust, transferable features. This dual augmentation strategy complements invariant causal distillation by ensuring that the learned representations remain stable across a wider range of data variations and transformations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, achieving competitive results in same-architecture KD.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. Consequently, few RL-based trajectory planning methods can achieve performance comparable to that of imitation learning-based methods. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. Evaluated using closed-loop metrics, the results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed the baseline employing the identical policy model structure and achieved competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art method.

      <title>Multi-view biomedical foundation models for molecule-target and property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19704v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quality molecular representations are key to foundation model development in bio-medical research. Previous efforts have typically focused on a single representation or molecular view, which may have strengths or weaknesses on a given task. We develop Multi-view Molecular Embedding with Late Fusion (MMELON), an approach that integrates graph, image and text views in a foundation model setting and may be readily extended to additional representations. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules. The multi-view model performs robustly, matching the performance of the highest-ranked single-view. It is validated on over 120 tasks, including molecular solubility, ADME properties, and activity against G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). We identify 33 GPCRs that are related to Alzheimer's disease and employ the multi-view model to select strong binders from a compound screen. Predictions are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying calibration error in modern neural networks through evidence based theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthiness in neural networks is crucial for their deployment in critical applications, where reliability, confidence, and uncertainty play pivotal roles in decision-making. Traditional performance metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture these aspects, particularly in cases where models exhibit overconfidence. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework for quantifying the trustworthiness of neural networks by incorporating subjective logic into the evaluation of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). This method provides a comprehensive measure of trust, disbelief, and uncertainty by clustering predicted probabilities and fusing opinions using appropriate fusion operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, where post-calibration results indicate improved trustworthiness. The proposed framework offers a more interpretable and nuanced assessment of AI models, with potential applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>TextDestroyer: A Training- and Annotation-Free Diffusion Method for Destroying Anomal Text from Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose TextDestroyer, the first training- and annotation-free method for scene text destruction using a pre-trained diffusion model. Existing scene text removal models require complex annotation and retraining, and may leave faint yet recognizable text information, compromising privacy protection and content concealment. TextDestroyer addresses these issues by employing a three-stage hierarchical process to obtain accurate text masks. Our method scrambles text areas in the latent start code using a Gaussian distribution before reconstruction. During the diffusion denoising process, self-attention key and value are referenced from the original latent to restore the compromised background. Latent codes saved at each inversion step are used for replacement during reconstruction, ensuring perfect background restoration. The advantages of TextDestroyer include: (1) it eliminates labor-intensive data annotation and resource-intensive training; (2) it achieves more thorough text destruction, preventing recognizable traces; and (3) it demonstrates better generalization capabilities, performing well on both real-world scenes and generated images.</description>

      <title>ViTally Consistent: Scaling Biological Representation Learning for Cell Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale cell microscopy screens are used in drug discovery and molecular biology research to study the effects of millions of chemical and genetic perturbations on cells. To use these images in downstream analysis, we need models that can map each image into a feature space that represents diverse biological phenotypes consistently, in the sense that perturbations with similar biological effects have similar representations. In this work, we present the largest foundation model for cell microscopy data to date, a new 1.9 billion-parameter ViT-G/8 MAE trained on over 8 billion microscopy image crops. Compared to a previous published ViT-L/8 MAE, our new model achieves a 60% improvement in linear separability of genetic perturbations and obtains the best overall performance on whole-genome biological relationship recall and replicate consistency benchmarks. Beyond scaling, we developed two key methods that improve performance: (1) training on a curated and diverse dataset; and, (2) using biologically motivated linear probing tasks to search across each transformer block for the best candidate representation of whole-genome screens. We find that many self-supervised vision transformers, pretrained on either natural or microscopy images, yield significantly more biologically meaningful representations of microscopy images in their intermediate blocks than in their typically used final blocks. More broadly, our approach and results provide insights toward a general strategy for successfully building foundation models for large-scale biological data.</description>

      <title>Patherea: Cell Detection and Classification for the 2020s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Patherea, a unified framework for point-based cell detection and classification that enables the development and fair evaluation of state-of-the-art methods. To support this, we introduce a large-scale dataset that replicates the clinical workflow for Ki-67 proliferation index estimation. Our method directly predicts cell locations and classes without relying on intermediate representations. It incorporates a hybrid Hungarian matching strategy for accurate point assignment and supports flexible backbones and training regimes, including recent pathology foundation models. Patherea achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets - Lizard, BRCA-M2C, and BCData - while highlighting performance saturation on these benchmarks. In contrast, our newly proposed Patherea dataset presents a significantly more challenging benchmark. Additionally, we identify and correct common errors in current evaluation protocols and provide an updated benchmarking utility for standardized assessment. The Patherea dataset and code are publicly available to facilitate further research and fair comparisons.</description>

      <title>Many Objective Problems Where Crossover is Provably Essential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses theory in evolutionary many-objective optimization and focuses on the role of crossover operators. The advantages of using crossover are hardly understood and rigorous runtime analyses with crossover are lagging far behind its use in practice, specifically in the case of more than two objectives. We present two many-objective problems $RR_{\text{RO}}$ and $uRR_{\text{RO}}$ together with a theoretical runtime analysis of the GSEMO and the widely used NSGA-III algorithm to demonstrate that one point crossover on $RR_{\text{RO}}$, as well as uniform crossover on $uRR_{\text{RO}}$, can yield an exponential speedup in the runtime. In particular, when the number of objectives is constant, this algorithms can find the Pareto set of both problems in expected polynomial time when using crossover while without crossover they require exponential time to even find a single Pareto-optimal point. For both problems, we also demonstrate a significant performance gap in certain superconstant parameter regimes for the number of objectives. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first rigorous runtime analysis in many-objective optimization which demonstrates an exponential performance gap when using crossover for more than two objectives. Additionally, it is the first runtime analysis involving crossover in many-objective optimization where the number of objectives is not necessarily constant.</description>

      <title>ChipAlign: Instruction Alignment in Large Language Models for Chip Design via Geodesic Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their application across various domains, including chip design, where domain-adapted chip models like ChipNeMo have emerged. However, these models often struggle with instruction alignment, a crucial capability for LLMs that involves following explicit human directives. This limitation impedes the practical application of chip LLMs, including serving as assistant chatbots for hardware design engineers. In this work, we introduce ChipAlign, a novel approach that utilizes a training-free model merging strategy, combining the strengths of a general instruction-aligned LLM with a chip-specific LLM. By considering the underlying manifold in the weight space, ChipAlign employs geodesic interpolation to effectively fuse the weights of input LLMs, producing a merged model that inherits strong instruction alignment and chip expertise from the respective instruction and chip LLMs. Our results demonstrate that ChipAlign significantly enhances instruction-following capabilities of existing chip LLMs, achieving up to a 26.6% improvement on the IFEval benchmark, while maintaining comparable expertise in the chip domain. This improvement in instruction alignment also translates to notable gains in instruction-involved QA tasks, delivering performance enhancements of 3.9% on the OpenROAD QA benchmark and 8.25% on production-level chip QA benchmarks, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning an Effective Premise Retrieval Model for Efficient Mathematical Formalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formalized mathematics has recently garnered significant attention for its ability to assist mathematicians across various fields. Premise retrieval, as a common step in mathematical formalization, has been a challenge, particularly for inexperienced users. Existing retrieval methods that facilitate natural language queries require a certain level of mathematical expertise from users, while approaches based on formal languages (e.g., Lean) typically struggle with the scarcity of training data, hindering the training of effective and generalizable retrieval models. In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages data extracted from Mathlib to train a lightweight and effective premise retrieval model. In particular, the proposed model embeds queries (i.e., proof state provided by Lean) and premises in a latent space, featuring a tokenizer specifically trained on formal corpora. The model is learned in a contrastive learning framework, in which a fine-grained similarity calculation method and a re-ranking module are applied to enhance the retrieval performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining a lower computational load. We have released an open-source search engine based on our retrieval model at https://premise-search.com/. The source code and the trained model can be found at https://github.com/ruc-ai4math/Premise-Retrieval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metadata management plays a critical role in data governance, resource discovery, and decision-making in the data-driven era. While traditional metadata approaches have primarily focused on organization, classification, and resource reuse, the integration of modern artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has significantly transformed these processes. This paper investigates both traditional and AI-driven metadata approaches by examining open-source solutions, commercial tools, and research initiatives. A comparative analysis of traditional and AI-driven metadata management methods is provided, highlighting existing challenges and their impact on next-generation datasets. The paper also presents an innovative AI-assisted metadata management framework designed to address these challenges. This framework leverages more advanced modern AI technologies to automate metadata generation, enhance governance, and improve the accessibility and usability of modern datasets. Finally, the paper outlines future directions for research and development, proposing opportunities to further advance metadata management in the context of AI-driven innovation and complex datasets.</description>

      <title>PATCH: a deep learning method to assess heterogeneity of artistic practice in historical paintings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The history of art has seen significant shifts in the manner in which artworks are created, making understanding of creative processes a central question in technical art history. In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, paintings were largely produced by master painters directing workshops of apprentices who often contributed to projects. The masters varied significantly in artistic and managerial styles, meaning different combinations of artists and implements might be seen both between masters and within workshops or even individual canvases. Information on how different workshops were managed and the processes by which artworks were created remains elusive. Machine learning methods have potential to unearth new information about artists' creative processes by extending the analysis of brushwork to a microscopic scale. Analysis of workshop paintings, however, presents a challenge in that documentation of the artists and materials involved is sparse, meaning external examples are not available to train networks to recognize their contributions. Here we present a novel machine learning approach we call pairwise assignment training for classifying heterogeneity (PATCH) that is capable of identifying individual artistic practice regimes with no external training data, or "ground truth." The method achieves unsupervised results by supervised means, and outperforms both simple statistical procedures and unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply this method to two historical paintings by the Spanish Renaissance master, El Greco: The Baptism of Christ and Christ on the Cross with Landscape, and our findings regarding the former potentially challenge previous work that has assigned the painting to workshop members. Further, the results of our analyses create a measure of heterogeneity of artistic practice that can be used to characterize artworks across time and space.</description>

      <title>Flexible and Efficient Grammar-Constrained Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often asked to generate structured outputs that obey precise syntactic rules, such as code snippets or formatted data. Grammar-constrained decoding (GCD) can guarantee that LLM outputs matches such rules by masking out tokens that will provably lead to outputs that do not belong to a specified context-free grammar (CFG). To guarantee soundness, GCD algorithms have to compute how a given LLM subword tokenizer can align with the tokens used
  by a given context-free grammar and compute token masks based on this information. Doing so efficiently is challenging and existing GCD algorithms require tens of minutes to preprocess common grammars. We present a new GCD algorithm together with an implementation that offers 17.71x faster offline preprocessing than existing approaches while preserving state-of-the-art efficiency in online mask computation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reason at the Frontier of Learnability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12272v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Towards Geo-Culturally Grounded LLM Generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13497v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated gaps in diverse cultural awareness across the globe. We investigate the effect of retrieval augmented generation and search-grounding techniques on LLMs' ability to display familiarity with various national cultures. Specifically, we compare the performance of standard LLMs, LLMs augmented with retrievals from a bespoke knowledge base (i.e., KB grounding), and LLMs augmented with retrievals from a web search (i.e., search grounding) on multiple cultural awareness benchmarks. We find that search grounding significantly improves the LLM performance on multiple-choice benchmarks that test propositional knowledge (e.g., cultural norms, artifacts, and institutions), while KB grounding's effectiveness is limited by inadequate knowledge base coverage and a suboptimal retriever. However, search grounding also increases the risk of stereotypical judgments by language models and fails to improve evaluators' judgments of cultural familiarity in a human evaluation with adequate statistical power. These results highlight the distinction between propositional cultural knowledge and open-ended cultural fluency when it comes to evaluating LLMs' cultural awareness.</description>

      <title>LUMINA-Net: Low-light Upgrade through Multi-stage Illumination and Noise Adaptation Network for Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a crucial task in computer vision aimed at enhancing the visual fidelity of images captured under low-illumination conditions. Conventional methods frequently struggle with noise, overexposure, and color distortion, leading to significant image quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose LUMINA-Net, an unsupervised deep learning framework that learns adaptive priors from low-light image pairs by integrating multi-stage illumination and reflectance modules. To assist the Retinex decomposition, inappropriate features in the raw image can be removed using a simple self-supervised mechanism. First, the illumination module intelligently adjusts brightness and contrast while preserving intricate textural details. Second, the reflectance module incorporates a noise reduction mechanism that leverages spatial attention and channel-wise feature refinement to mitigate noise contamination. Through extensive experiments on LOL and SICE datasets, evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, LUMINA-Net surpasses state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its efficacy in low-light image enhancement.</description>

      <title>FlipConcept: Tuning-Free Multi-Concept Personalization for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single image has recently gained attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation in complex scenes due to distortions in non-personalized regions and the need for additional fine-tuning, limiting their practicality. To address this issue, we propose FlipConcept, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates multiple personalized concepts into a single image without requiring additional tuning. We introduce guided appearance attention to enhance the visual fidelity of personalized concepts. Additionally, we introduce mask-guided noise mixing to protect non-personalized regions during concept integration. Lastly, we apply background dilution to minimize concept leakage, i.e., the undesired blending of personalized concepts with other objects in the image. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method, despite not requiring tuning, outperforms existing models in both single and multiple personalized concept inference. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach for scalable, high-quality multi-concept personalization.</description>

      <title>FADE: Why Bad Descriptions Happen to Good Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have highlighted the potential of automating interpretability pipelines in analyzing the latent representations within LLMs. While this may enhance our understanding of internal mechanisms, the field lacks standardized evaluation methods for assessing the validity of discovered features. We attempt to bridge this gap by introducing FADE: Feature Alignment to Description Evaluation, a scalable model-agnostic framework for automatically evaluating feature-to-description alignment. FADE evaluates alignment across four key metrics - Clarity, Responsiveness, Purity, and Faithfulness - and systematically quantifies the causes of the misalignment between features and their descriptions. We apply FADE to analyze existing open-source feature descriptions and assess key components of automated interpretability pipelines, aiming to enhance the quality of descriptions. Our findings highlight fundamental challenges in generating feature descriptions, particularly for SAEs compared to MLP neurons, providing insights into the limitations and future directions of automated interpretability. We release FADE as an open-source package at: https://github.com/brunibrun/FADE</description>

      <title>Neurons: Emulating the Human Visual Cortex Improves Fidelity and Interpretability in fMRI-to-Video Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural activity is essential for understanding the human brain. While fMRI methods have successfully reconstructed static images, fMRI-to-video reconstruction faces challenges due to the need for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics like motion and scene transitions. Recent approaches have improved semantic and perceptual alignment but struggle to integrate coarse fMRI data with detailed visual features. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of the visual system, we propose NEURONS, a novel framework that decouples learning into four correlated sub-tasks: key object segmentation, concept recognition, scene description, and blurry video reconstruction. This approach simulates the visual cortex's functional specialization, allowing the model to capture diverse video content. In the inference stage, NEURONS generates robust conditioning signals for a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model to reconstruct the videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEURONS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving solid improvements in video consistency (26.6%) and semantic-level accuracy (19.1%). Notably, NEURONS shows a strong functional correlation with the visual cortex, highlighting its potential for brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications. Code and model weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/NEURONS.</description>

      <title>Visual Position Prompt for MLLM based Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15426v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grained localization.To effectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Assessment of the Non-IID Data Impact in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative machine learning (ML) model training among decentralized clients' information, ensuring data privacy. The decentralized nature of FL deals with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This open problem has notable consequences, such as decreased model performance and more significant convergence times. Despite its importance, experimental studies systematically addressing all types of data heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IIDness) remain scarce. We aim to fill this gap by assessing and quantifying the non-IID effect through a thorough empirical analysis. We use the Hellinger Distance (HD) to measure differences in distribution among clients. Our study benchmarks four state-of-the-art strategies for handling non-IID data, including label, feature, quantity, and spatiotemporal skewness, under realistic and controlled conditions. This is the first comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal skew effect in FL. Our findings highlight the significant impact of label and spatiotemporal skew non-IID types on FL model performance, with notable performance drops occurring at specific HD thresholds. Additionally, the FL performance is heavily affected mainly when the non-IIDness is extreme. Thus, we provide recommendations for FL research to tackle data heterogeneity effectively. Our work represents the most extensive examination of non-IIDness in FL, offering a robust foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>AnnoPage Dataset: Dataset of Non-Textual Elements in Documents with Fine-Grained Categorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the AnnoPage Dataset, a novel collection of 7,550 pages from historical documents, primarily in Czech and German, spanning from 1485 to the present, focusing on the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The dataset is designed to support research in document layout analysis and object detection. Each page is annotated with axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) representing elements of 25 categories of non-textual elements, such as images, maps, decorative elements, or charts, following the Czech Methodology of image document processing. The annotations were created by expert librarians to ensure accuracy and consistency. The dataset also incorporates pages from multiple, mainly historical, document datasets to enhance variability and maintain continuity. The dataset is divided into development and test subsets, with the test set carefully selected to maintain the category distribution. We provide baseline results using YOLO and DETR object detectors, offering a reference point for future research. The AnnoPage Dataset is publicly available on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12788419), along with ground-truth annotations in YOLO format.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Unreliable for Cyber Threat Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent works have argued that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to tame the data deluge in the cybersecurity field, by improving the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. This work presents an evaluation methodology that other than allowing to test LLMs on CTI tasks when using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and fine-tuning, also allows to quantify their consistency and their confidence level. We run experiments with three state-of-the-art LLMs and a dataset of 350 threat intelligence reports and present new evidence of potential security risks in relying on LLMs for CTI. We show how LLMs cannot guarantee sufficient performance on real-size reports while also being inconsistent and overconfident. Few-shot learning and fine-tuning only partially improve the results, thus posing doubts about the possibility of using LLMs for CTI scenarios, where labelled datasets are lacking and where confidence is a fundamental factor.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for User Stories in AI Systems: UStAI Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI systems are gaining widespread adoption across various sectors and domains. Creating high-quality AI system requirements is crucial for aligning the AI system with business goals and consumer values and for social responsibility. However, with the uncertain nature of AI systems and the heavy reliance on sensitive data, more research is needed to address the elicitation and analysis of AI systems requirements. With the proprietary nature of many AI systems, there is a lack of open-source requirements artifacts and technical requirements documents for AI systems, limiting broader research and investigation. With Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as a promising alternative to human-generated text, this paper investigates the potential use of LLMs to generate user stories for AI systems based on abstracts from scholarly papers. We conducted an empirical evaluation using three LLMs and generated $1260$ user stories from $42$ abstracts from $26$ domains. We assess their quality using the Quality User Story (QUS) framework. Moreover, we identify relevant non-functional requirements (NFRs) and ethical principles. Our analysis demonstrates that the investigated LLMs can generate user stories inspired by the needs of various stakeholders, offering a promising approach for generating user stories for research purposes and for aiding in the early requirements elicitation phase of AI systems. We have compiled and curated a collection of stories generated by various LLMs into a dataset (UStAI), which is now publicly available for use.</description>

      <title>Semantic Adapter for Universal Text Embeddings: Diagnosing and Mitigating Negation Blindness to Enhance Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negation plays an important role in various natural language processing tasks such as Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks. Numerous prior studies have found that contextual text embedding models such as BERT, ELMO, RoBERTa or XLNet face challenges in accurately understanding negation. Recent advancements in universal text embeddings have demonstrated superior performance over contextual text embeddings in various tasks. However, due to the bias in popular evaluation benchmarks, the negation awareness capacity of these models remains unclear. To bridge the gap in existing literature, an in-depth analysis is initiated in this work to study the negation awareness of cutting-edge universal text embedding models. Our findings reveal a significant lack of negation awareness in these models, often interpreting negated text pairs as semantically similar. To efficiently deal with the conflict that different tasks need different trade-offs between topic and negation information among other semantic information, a data-efficient and computational-efficient embedding re-weighting method is proposed without modifying the parameters of text embedding models. The proposed solution is able to improve text embedding models' negation awareness significantly on both simple negation understanding task and complex negation understanding task. Furthermore, the proposed solution can also significantly improve the negation awareness of Large Language Model based task-specific high dimensional universal text embeddings.</description>

      <title>MobileCity: An Efficient Framework for Large-Scale Urban Behavior Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices, rely heavily on static agent profiles leading to behavioral homogenization, and inherit prohibitive computational costs. To address these limitations, we present MobileCity, a lightweight simulation platform designed to model realistic urban mobility with high computational efficiency. We introduce a comprehensive transportation system with multiple transport modes, and collect questionnaire data from respondents to construct agent profiles. To enable scalable simulation, agents perform action selection within a pre-generated action space and uses local models for efficient agent memory generation. Through extensive micro and macro-level evaluations on 4,000 agents, we demonstrate that MobileCity generates more realistic urban behaviors than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. We further explore practical applications such as predicting movement patterns and analyzing demographic trends in transportation preferences.</description>

      <title>TD-EVAL: Revisiting Task-Oriented Dialogue Evaluation by Combining Turn-Level Precision with Dialogue-Level Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are experiencing a revolution driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation methodologies for these systems remain insufficient for their growing sophistication. While traditional automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a plug-and-play framework for future research.</description>

      <title>What's Pulling the Strings? Evaluating Integrity and Attribution in AI Training and Inference through Concept Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has amplified concerns about trustworthiness, including integrity, privacy, robustness, and bias. To assess and attribute these threats, we propose ConceptLens, a generic framework that leverages pre-trained multimodal models to identify the root causes of integrity threats by analyzing Concept Shift in probing samples. ConceptLens demonstrates strong detection performance for vanilla data poisoning attacks and uncovers vulnerabilities to bias injection, such as the generation of covert advertisements through malicious concept shifts. It identifies privacy risks in unaltered but high-risk samples, filters them before training, and provides insights into model weaknesses arising from incomplete or imbalanced training data. Additionally, at the model level, it attributes concepts that the target model is overly dependent on, identifies misleading concepts, and explains how disrupting key concepts negatively impacts the model. Furthermore, it uncovers sociological biases in generative content, revealing disparities across sociological contexts. Strikingly, ConceptLens reveals how safe training and inference data can be unintentionally and easily exploited, potentially undermining safety alignment. Our study informs actionable insights to breed trust in AI systems, thereby speeding adoption and driving greater innovation.</description>

      <title>On the Need for a Statistical Foundation in Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety assessment, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and established software testing methods, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (\textit{pfs}) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we give an example of formal reasoning about alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, a first step towards supporting statistically defensible simulation-based safety claims.</description>

      <title>Flow-GRPO: Training Flow Matching Models via Online RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</description>

      <title>Diffused Responsibility: Analyzing the Energy Consumption of Generative Text-to-Audio Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio models have recently emerged as a powerful technology for generating sound from textual descriptions. However, their high computational demands raise concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the energy usage of 7 state-of-the-art text-to-audio diffusion-based generative models, evaluating to what extent variations in generation parameters affect energy consumption at inference time. We also aim to identify an optimal balance between audio quality and energy consumption by considering Pareto-optimal solutions across all selected models. Our findings provide insights into the trade-offs between performance and environmental impact, contributing to the development of more efficient generative audio models.</description>

      <title>How Hungry is AI? Benchmarking Energy, Water, and Carbon Footprint of LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel infrastructure-aware benchmarking framework for quantifying the environmental footprint of LLM inference across 30 state-of-the-art models as deployed in commercial data centers. Our framework combines public API performance data with region-specific environmental multipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We additionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank models by performance relative to environmental cost. Our results show that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 emerge as the most energy-intensive models, consuming over 33 Wh per long prompt, more than 70 times the consumption of GPT-4.1 nano, and that Claude-3.7 Sonnet ranks highest in eco-efficiency. While a single short GPT-4o query consumes 0.42 Wh, scaling this to 700 million queries/day results in substantial annual environmental impacts. These include electricity use comparable to 35,000 U.S. homes, freshwater evaporation matching the annual drinking needs of 1.2 million people, and carbon emissions requiring a Chicago-sized forest to offset. These findings illustrate a growing paradox: Although AI is becoming cheaper and faster, its global adoption drives disproportionate resource consumption. Our study provides a standardized, empirically grounded methodology for benchmarking the sustainability of LLM deployments, laying a foundation for future environmental accountability in AI development and sustainability standards.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Risk Assessments for Offensive Cybersecurity Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers, raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity, emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents' cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture of risk.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Often Know When They Are Being Evaluated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of $0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman, level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future models.</description>

      <title>AKReF: An argumentative knowledge representation framework for structured argumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). The proposed argumentative knowledge representation framework (AKReF) extends the theoretical foundation and enables the AKG to provide a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand. Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we apply modus ponens on premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes capturing key argumentative features such as the type of premise (e.g., axiom, ordinary premise, assumption), the type of inference rule (e.g., strict, defeasible), preference order over defeasible rules, markers (e.g., "therefore", "however"), and the type of attack (e.g., undercut, rebuttal, undermining). We identify inference rules by locating a specific set of markers, called inference markers (IM). This, in turn, makes it possible to identify undercut attacks previously undetectable in existing datasets. AKG prepares the ground for reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is essential to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, helps reasoning models learn the implicit, indirect relations that require inference over arguments and their interconnections. We use an essay from the AAEC dataset to illustrate the framework. We further show its application in complex analyses such as extracting a conflict-free set and a maximal set of admissible arguments.</description>

      <title>HueManity: Probing Fine-Grained Visual Perception in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>ScaleRTL: Scaling LLMs with Reasoning Data and Test-Time Compute for Accurate RTL Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data. While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL, the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.</description>

      <title>Position Prediction Self-Supervised Learning for Multimodal Satellite Imagery Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction, encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than reconstruction-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Predictable Scale: Part II, Farseer: A Refined Scaling Law in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions, demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings, enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy. However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round. This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning, which includes an optimal proximal term and utilizes a reference model that incorporates previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model performance and clients' low computing cost.</description>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning, address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data Protection in the (Generative) Artificial Intelligence Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.</description>

      <title>Symbiosis: Multi-Adapter Inference and Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning, each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model. The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method, to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.</description>

      <title>Magneto-radiative modelling and artificial neural network optimization of biofluid flow in a stenosed arterial domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities, such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids, which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to the changes in the Maxwell parameter.</description>

      <title>Bridging Literature and the Universe Via A Multi-Agent Large Language Model System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful, internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at: https://youtu.be/w1zLpm_CaWA. The complete system and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/xwzhang98/SimAgents.</description>

      <title>Towards Agentic RAG with Deep Reasoning: A Survey of RAG-Reasoning Systems in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at https://github.com/DavidZWZ/Awesome-RAG-Reasoning.</description>

      <title>THOR: Transformer Heuristics for On-Demand Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the THOR (Transformer Heuristics for On-Demand Retrieval) Module, designed and implemented by eSapiens, a secure, scalable engine that transforms natural-language questions into verified, read-only SQL analytics for enterprise databases. The Text-to-SQL module follows a decoupled orchestration/execution architecture: a Supervisor Agent routes queries, Schema Retrieval dynamically injects table and column metadata, and a SQL Generation Agent emits single-statement SELECT queries protected by a read-only guardrail. An integrated Self-Correction &amp; Rating loop captures empty results, execution errors, or low-quality outputs and triggers up to five LLM-driven regeneration attempts. Finally, a Result Interpretation Agent produces concise, human-readable insights and hands raw rows to the Insight &amp; Intelligence engine for visualization or forecasting.
  Smoke tests across finance, sales, and operations scenarios demonstrate reliable ad-hoc querying and automated periodic reporting. By embedding schema awareness, fault-tolerant execution, and compliance guardrails, the THOR Module empowers non-technical users to access live data with zero-SQL simplicity and enterprise-grade safety.</description>

      <title>NeuTSFlow: Modeling Continuous Functions Behind Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as learning the transition from the historical function family to the future function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the transition path in function space from the historical function family to the future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead. Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family perspective.</description>

      <title>A PBN-RL-XAI Framework for Discovering a "Hit-and-Run" Therapeutic Strategy in Melanoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ''hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Evaluation of AI Models in Biology: Outcomes and Recommendations from the CZI Virtual Cells Workshop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds immense promise for transforming biology, yet a lack of standardized, cross domain, benchmarks undermines our ability to build robust, trustworthy models. Here, we present insights from a recent workshop that convened machine learning and computational biology experts across imaging, transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomics to tackle this gap. We identify major technical and systemic bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity and noise, reproducibility challenges, biases, and the fragmented ecosystem of publicly available resources and propose a set of recommendations for building benchmarking frameworks that can efficiently compare ML models of biological systems across tasks and data modalities. By promoting high quality data curation, standardized tooling, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and open, collaborative platforms, we aim to accelerate the development of robust benchmarks for AI driven Virtual Cells. These benchmarks are crucial for ensuring rigor, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and will ultimately advance the field toward integrated models that drive new discoveries, therapeutic insights, and a deeper understanding of cellular systems.</description>

      <title>Accurate generation of chemical reaction transition states by conditional flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition state (TS) structures define the critical geometries and energy barriers underlying chemical reactivity, yet their fleeting nature renders them experimentally elusive and drives the reliance on costly, high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Here, we introduce TS-GEN, a conditional flow-matching generative model that maps samples from a simple Gaussian prior directly to transition-state saddle-point geometries in a single, deterministic pass. By embedding both reactant and product conformations as conditioning information, TS-GEN learns to transport latent noise to true TS structures via an optimal-transport path, effectively replacing the iterative optimization common in nudged-elastic band or string-method algorithms. TS-GEN delivers unprecedented accuracy, achieving a root-mean-square deviation of $0.004\ \rm{\mathring{A}}$ (vs. $0.103\ \rm{\mathring{A}}$ for prior state-of-the-art) and a mean barrier-height error of $1.019\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ (vs. $2.864\ {\rm kcal/mol}$), while requiring only $0.06\ {\rm s}$ GPU time per inference. Over 87% of generated TSs meet chemical-accuracy criteria ($&lt;1.58\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ error), substantially outpacing existing methods. TS-GEN also exhibits strong transferability to out-of-distribution reactions from a larger database. By uniting sub-angstrom precision, sub-second speed, and broad applicability, TS-GEN will be highly useful for high-throughput exploration of complex reaction networks, paving the way to the exploration of novel chemical reaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>NLP Meets the World: Toward Improving Conversations With the Public About Natural Language Processing Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been accompanied by rapidly growing public interest in natural language processing (NLP). This attention is reflected by major news venues, which sometimes invite NLP researchers to share their knowledge and views with a wide audience. Recognizing the opportunities of the present, for both the research field and for individual researchers, this paper shares recommendations for communicating with a general audience about the capabilities and limitations of NLP. These recommendations cover three themes: vague terminology as an obstacle to public understanding, unreasonable expectations as obstacles to sustainable growth, and ethical failures as obstacles to continued support. Published NLP research and popular news coverage are cited to illustrate these themes with examples. The recommendations promote effective, transparent communication with the general public about NLP, in order to strengthen public understanding and encourage support for research.</description>

      <title>Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender: AI Agents to fact-check YouTube videos and influence opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant threat in today's digital world, often spreading rapidly through platforms like YouTube. This paper introduces a novel approach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that not only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages users in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system comprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.
  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search, Google FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced and comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender leverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to generate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive debate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to iteratively improve its style and refine its output.
  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established benchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its potential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings highlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the potential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering a more informed online space.</description>

      <title>When and Where do Data Poisons Attack Textual Inversion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose significant challenges to the robustness of diffusion models (DMs). In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning attacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for DMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for visualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify and experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across timesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias and inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we observe that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept regions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these insights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism comprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency poison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid adversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning methods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all poisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published defenses.

      <title>Extension OL-MDISF: Online Learning from Mix-Typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online learning, where feature spaces can change over time, offers a flexible learning paradigm that has attracted considerable attention. However, it still faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Additionally, the time and cost constraints make it infeasible to label every data instance in a supervised setting. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new algorithm Online Learning from Mix-typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features (OL-MDISF), which aims to relax restrictions on both feature types, data distribution, and supervision information. Our approach involves utilizing copula models to create a comprehensive latent space, employing an adaptive sliding window for detecting drift points to ensure model stability, and establishing label proximity information based on geometric structural relationships. To demonstrate the model's efficiency and effectiveness, we provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental results.
  This extension serves as a standalone technical reference to the original OL-MDISF method. It provides (i) a contextual analysis of OL-MDISF within the broader landscape of online learning, covering recent advances in mixed-type feature modeling, concept drift adaptation, and weak supervision, and (ii) a comprehensive set of experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios. These include full CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal ensemble dynamics. We hope this document can serve as a reproducible benchmark and technical resource for researchers working on nonstationary, heterogeneous, and weakly supervised data streams.</description>

      <title>GHPO: Adaptive Guidance for Stable and Efficient LLM Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.</description>

      <title>A Group Theoretic Analysis of the Symmetries Underlying Base Addition and Their Learnability by Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in the use of neural networks both for modeling human cognitive function and for artificial intelligence is the design of systems with the capacity to efficiently learn functions that support radical generalization. At the roots of this is the capacity to discover and implement symmetry functions. In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of radical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder, when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a function of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can achieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function, and that learnability is closely correlated with carry function structure. We then discuss the relevance this has for cognitive science and machine learning.</description>

      <title>"Is it always watching? Is it always listening?" Exploring Contextual Privacy and Security Concerns Toward Domestic Social Robots</title>

Abstract: Equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensing capabilities, social robots are gaining interest among consumers in the United States. These robots seem like a natural evolution of traditional smart home devices. However, their extensive data collection capabilities, anthropomorphic features, and capacity to interact with their environment make social robots a more significant security and privacy threat. Increased risks include data linkage, unauthorized data sharing, and the physical safety of users and their homes. It is critical to investigate U.S. users' security and privacy needs and concerns to guide the design of social robots while these devices are still in the early stages of commercialization in the U.S. market. Through 19 semi-structured interviews, we identified significant security and privacy concerns, highlighting the need for transparency, usability, and robust privacy controls to support adoption. For educational applications, participants worried most about misinformation, and in medical use cases, they worried about the reliability of these devices. Participants were also concerned with the data inference that social robots could enable. We found that participants expect tangible privacy controls, indicators of data collection, and context-appropriate functionality.</description>

      <title>Automated Novelty Evaluation of Academic Paper: A Collaborative Approach Integrating Human and Large Language Model Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating academic papers. Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain. Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to address the limitations of novelty assessment. One of the most common types of novelty in academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs, e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper, which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human and LLM knowledge. We compared the method we proposed with a large number of baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.</description>

      <title>SystolicAttention: Fusing FlashAttention within a Single Systolic Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models rely heavily on scaled dot-product attention (SDPA), typically implemented using the FlashAttention algorithm. However, current systolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing FlashAttention. Systolic arrays can only achieve high utilization for consecutive and large matrix multiplications. In contrast, FlashAttention requires frequently interleaved matrix multiplications and softmax operations.
  The frequent data swaps between the systolic array and external vector units result in low systolic array utilization. This is further exacerbated by the fact that softmax involves numerous non-matrix operations, which are not well-suited for systolic arrays. Moreover, the concurrent execution of matrix multiplication on systolic arrays and softmax on vector units leads to register file and SRAM port contention, further degrading performance.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array architecture that enables the entire FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely within a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units. At the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps FlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise overlap. This significantly improves array utilization while preserving the original floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.
  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art commercial accelerators. Our results show that FSA achieves 1.77x and 4.83x higher attention FLOPs/s utilization compared to AWS NeuronCore-v2 and Google TPUv5e, respectively, with only about 10% area overhead.</description>
