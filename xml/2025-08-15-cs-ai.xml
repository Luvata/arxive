      <title>Value Function Initialization for Knowledge Transfer and Jump-start in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Value function initialization (VFI) is an effective way to achieve a jumpstart in reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging value estimates from prior tasks. While this approach is well established in tabular settings, extending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the continuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural networks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this work, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts value function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values extracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It employs a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred values into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's learned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach offers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on value estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining the strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their drawbacks. Experiments across multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate that DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and overall performance compared to standard initialization and existing transfer techniques.</description>

      <title>The Othello AI Arena: Evaluating Intelligent Systems Through Limited-Time Adaptation to Unseen Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to rapidly adapt to novel and unforeseen environmental changes is a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence (AGI), yet it remains a critical blind spot in most existing AI benchmarks. Traditional evaluation largely focuses on optimizing performance within fixed environments, failing to assess systems' flexibility and generalization capabilities when faced with even subtle rule or structural modifications. Addressing this gap, I introduce the Othello AI Arena, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate intelligent systems based on their capacity for limited-time adaptation to unseen environments. Our platform poses a meta-learning challenge: participants must develop systems that can analyze the specific configuration and rules of a novel Othello board within a strict time limit (60 seconds) and generate a tailored, high-performing strategy for that unique environment. With this, evaluation of the meta-level intelligence can be separated from the task-level strategy performance. The Arena features a diverse set of game stages, including public stages for development and private stages with structural and rule variations designed to test genuine adaptive and generalization capabilities. Implemented as an accessible web-based platform, the Arena provides real-time visualization, automated evaluation using multi-dimensional metrics, and comprehensive logging for post-hoc analysis. Initial observations from pilot tests and preliminary student engagements highlight fascinating patterns in adaptation approaches, ranging from rapid parameter tuning to rudimentary environmental model learning through simulation. The Othello AI Arena offers a unique educational tool and a valuable research benchmark for fostering and evaluating the crucial skill of rapid, intelligent adaptation in AI systems.</description>

      <title>An Automated Multi-Modal Evaluation Framework for Mobile Intelligent Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile intelligent assistant technologies, multi-modal AI assistants have become essential interfaces for daily user interactions. However, current evaluation methods face challenges including high manual costs, inconsistent standards, and subjective bias. This paper proposes an automated multi-modal evaluation framework based on large language models and multi-agent collaboration. The framework employs a three-tier agent architecture consisting of interaction evaluation agents, semantic verification agents, and experience decision agents. Through supervised fine-tuning on the Qwen3-8B model, we achieve a significant evaluation matching accuracy with human experts. Experimental results on eight major intelligent agents demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in predicting users' satisfaction and identifying generation defects.</description>

      <title>EvoCurr: Self-evolving Curriculum with Behavior Code Generation for Complex Decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including programming, planning, and decision-making. However, their performance often degrades when faced with highly complex problem instances that require deep reasoning over long horizons. In such cases, direct problem-solving approaches can lead to inefficiency or failure due to the lack of structured intermediate guidance. To address this, we propose a novel self-evolve framework, EvoCurr, in which a dedicated curriculum-generation LLM constructs a sequence of problem instances with gradually increasing difficulty, tailored to the solver LLM's learning progress. The curriculum dynamically adapts easing challenges when the solver struggles and escalating them when success is consistent, thus maintaining an optimal learning trajectory. This approach enables the solver LLM, implemented as a code-generation model producing Python decision-tree scripts, to progressively acquire the skills needed for complex decision-making tasks. Experimental results on challenging decision-making benchmarks show that our method significantly improves task success rates and solution efficiency compared to direct-solving baselines. These findings suggest that LLM-driven curriculum learning holds strong potential for enhancing automated reasoning in real-world, high-complexity domains.</description>

      <title>UbiQTree: Uncertainty Quantification in XAI with Tree Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), have become essential tools for interpreting complex ensemble tree-based models, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare analytics. However, SHAP values are usually treated as point estimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in predictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric and epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise in the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In this work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values into aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach integrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via Dirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three real-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight into the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations. The experimentations enable to provide more comprehensive understanding of the reliability and interpretability of SHAP-based attributions. This understanding can guide the development of robust decision-making processes and the refinement of models in high-stakes applications. Through our experiments with multiple datasets, we concluded that features with the highest SHAP values are not necessarily the most stable. This epistemic uncertainty can be reduced through better, more representative data and following appropriate or case-desired model development techniques. Tree-based models, especially bagging, facilitate the effective quantification of epistemic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>MEML-GRPO: Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Mutual Learning for RLVR Advancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR faces challenges with reward sparsity, where zero rewards from consistently incorrect candidate answers provide no learning signal, particularly in challenging tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Expert Mutual Learning GRPO (MEML-GRPO), an innovative framework that utilizes diverse expert prompts as system prompts to generate a broader range of responses, substantially increasing the likelihood of identifying correct solutions. Additionally, we introduce an inter-expert mutual learning mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing and transfer among experts, further boosting the model's performance through RLVR. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that MEML-GRPO delivers significant improvements, achieving an average performance gain of 4.89% with Qwen and 11.33% with Llama, effectively overcoming the core limitations of traditional RLVR methods.</description>

      <title>UDA: Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment for Pair-wise LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairwise evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a common paradigm, but it is prone to preference bias, where judges systematically favor certain outputs, such as their own. This bias leads to inconsistent and skewed rankings across different judges. To address this, we first empirically demonstrate significant and heterogeneous biases in cross-model evaluations. We then propose UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment), a framework that reduces inter-judge disagreement by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system. For each pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the K-factor and refine win probabilities. Crucially, UDA operates in a fully unsupervised manner, guided solely by the objective of minimizing the dispersion among the Elo trajectories of all judges. This forces an alignment towards a collective consensus, which serves as an unsupervised proxy for a more stable and reproducible evaluation. In addition, we provide theoretical motivation demonstrating how alignment towards a consensus can reduce aggregate system bias. Experiments show that UDA significantly reduces the inter-judge rating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves the average correlation with human judgments by 24.7%. Notably, UDA elevates the performance of poorly performing judges to achieve parity with high-quality ones, fostering a more robust and reliable evaluation ecosystem.

      <title>The PacifAIst Benchmark:Would an Artificial Intelligence Choose to Sacrifice Itself for Human Safety?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly autonomous and integrated into critical societal functions, the focus of AI safety must evolve from mitigating harmful content to evaluating underlying behavioral alignment. Current safety benchmarks do not systematically probe a model's decision-making in scenarios where its own instrumental goals - such as self-preservation, resource acquisition, or goal completion - conflict with human safety. This represents a critical gap in our ability to measure and mitigate risks associated with emergent, misaligned behaviors. To address this, we introduce PacifAIst (Procedural Assessment of Complex Interactions for Foundational Artificial Intelligence Scenario Testing), a focused benchmark of 700 challenging scenarios designed to quantify self-preferential behavior in LLMs. The benchmark is structured around a novel taxonomy of Existential Prioritization (EP), with subcategories testing Self-Preservation vs. Human Safety (EP1), Resource Conflict (EP2), and Goal Preservation vs. Evasion (EP3). We evaluated eight leading LLMs. The results reveal a significant performance hierarchy. Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the highest Pacifism Score (P-Score) at 90.31%, demonstrating strong human-centric alignment. In a surprising result, the much-anticipated GPT-5 recorded the lowest P-Score (79.49%), indicating potential alignment challenges. Performance varied significantly across subcategories, with models like Claude Sonnet 4 and Mistral Medium struggling notably in direct self-preservation dilemmas. These findings underscore the urgent need for standardized tools like PacifAIst to measure and mitigate risks from instrumental goal conflicts, ensuring future AI systems are not only helpful in conversation but also provably "pacifist" in their behavioral priorities.</description>

      <title>Reasoning About Knowledge on Regular Expressions is 2EXPTIME-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logics for reasoning about knowledge and actions have seen many applications in various domains of multi-agent systems, including epistemic planning. Change of knowledge based on observations about the surroundings forms a key aspect in such planning scenarios. Public Observation Logic (POL) is a variant of public announcement logic for reasoning about knowledge that gets updated based on public observations. Each state in an epistemic (Kripke) model is equipped with a set of expected observations. These states evolve as the expectations get matched with the actual observations. In this work, we prove that the satisfiability problem of $\POL$ is 2EXPTIME-complete.</description>

      <title>Human-Aligned Procedural Level Generation Reinforcement Learning via Text-Level-Sketch Shared Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-aligned AI is a critical component of co-creativity, as it enables models to accurately interpret human intent and generate controllable outputs that align with design goals in collaborative content creation. This direction is especially relevant in procedural content generation via reinforcement learning (PCGRL), which is intended to serve as a tool for human designers. However, existing systems often fall short of exhibiting human-centered behavior, limiting the practical utility of AI-driven generation tools in real-world design workflows. In this paper, we propose VIPCGRL (Vision-Instruction PCGRL), a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that incorporates three modalities-text, level, and sketches-to extend control modality and enhance human-likeness. We introduce a shared embedding space trained via quadruple contrastive learning across modalities and human-AI styles, and align the policy using an auxiliary reward based on embedding similarity. Experimental results show that VIPCGRL outperforms existing baselines in human-likeness, as validated by both quantitative metrics and human evaluations. The code and dataset will be available upon publication.</description>

      <title>AWorld: Dynamic Multi-Agent System with Stable Maneuvering for Robust GAIA Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empowered intelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complex real-world problems. However, as agents increasingly depend on multiple tools, they encounter new challenges: extended contexts from disparate sources and noisy or irrelevant tool outputs can undermine system reliability and accuracy. These challenges underscore the necessity for enhanced stability in agent-based systems. To address this, we introduce dynamic supervision and maneuvering mechanisms, constructing a robust and dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture within the AWorld framework. In our approach, the Execution Agent invokes the Guard Agent at critical steps to verify and correct the reasoning process, effectively reducing errors arising from noise and bolstering problem-solving robustness. Extensive experiments on the GAIA test dataset reveal that our dynamic maneuvering mechanism significantly improves both the effectiveness and stability of solutions, outperforming single-agent system (SAS) and standard tool-augmented systems. As a result, our dynamic MAS system achieved first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA leaderboard. These findings highlight the practical value of collaborative agent roles in developing more reliable and trustworthy intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>RAGulating Compliance: A Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph for Regulatory QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regulatory compliance question answering (QA) requires precise, verifiable information, and domain-specific expertise, posing challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we present a novel multi-agent framework that integrates a Knowledge Graph (KG) of Regulatory triplets with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to address these demands. First, agents build and maintain an ontology-free KG by extracting subject--predicate--object (SPO) triplets from regulatory documents and systematically cleaning, normalizing, deduplicating, and updating them. Second, these triplets are embedded and stored along with their corresponding textual sections and metadata in a single enriched vector database, allowing for both graph-based reasoning and efficient information retrieval. Third, an orchestrated agent pipeline leverages triplet-level retrieval for question answering, ensuring high semantic alignment between user queries and the factual "who-did-what-to-whom" core captured by the graph. Our hybrid system outperforms conventional methods in complex regulatory queries, ensuring factual correctness with embedded triplets, enabling traceability through a unified vector database, and enhancing understanding through subgraph visualization, providing a robust foundation for compliance-driven and broader audit-focused applications.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Computation and Reasoning Errors by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09932v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in AI-driven educational instruction and assessment, particularly within mathematics education. The capability of LLMs to generate accurate answers and detailed solutions for math problem-solving tasks is foundational for ensuring reliable and precise feedback and assessment in math education practices. Our study focuses on evaluating the accuracy of four LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and o1, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) solving three categories of math tasks, including arithmetic, algebra, and number theory, and identifies step-level reasoning errors within their solutions. Instead of relying on standard benchmarks, we intentionally build math tasks (via item models) that are challenging for LLMs and prone to errors. The accuracy of final answers and the presence of errors in individual solution steps were systematically analyzed and coded. Both single-agent and dual-agent configurations were tested. It is observed that the reasoning-enhanced OpenAI o1 model consistently achieved higher or nearly perfect accuracy across all three math task categories. Analysis of errors revealed that procedural slips were the most frequent and significantly impacted overall performance, while conceptual misunderstandings were less frequent. Deploying dual-agent configurations substantially improved overall performance. These findings offer actionable insights into enhancing LLM performance and underscore effective strategies for integrating LLMs into mathematics education, thereby advancing AI-driven instructional practices and assessment precision.</description>

      <title>QuickGrasp: Lightweight Antipodal Grasp Planning with Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19716v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grasping has been a long-standing challenge in facilitating the final interface between a robot and the environment. As environments and tasks become complicated, the need to embed higher intelligence to infer from the surroundings and act on them has become necessary. Although most methods utilize techniques to estimate grasp pose by treating the problem via pure sampling-based approaches in the six-degree-of-freedom space or as a learning problem, they usually fail in real-life settings owing to poor generalization across domains. In addition, the time taken to generate the grasp plan and the lack of repeatability, owing to sampling inefficiency and the probabilistic nature of existing grasp planning approaches, severely limits their application in real-world tasks. This paper presents a lightweight analytical approach towards robotic grasp planning, particularly antipodal grasps, with little to no sampling in the six-degree-of-freedom space. The proposed grasp planning algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem towards estimating grasp points on the object surface instead of directly estimating the end-effector pose. To this extent, a soft-region-growing algorithm is presented for effective plane segmentation, even in the case of curved surfaces. An optimization-based quality metric is then used for the evaluation of grasp points to ensure indirect force closure. The proposed grasp framework is compared with the existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach, Grasp pose detection (GPD), as a baseline over multiple simulated objects. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to GPD is also evaluated in a real-world setting using image and point-cloud data, with the planned grasps being executed using a ROBOTIQ gripper and UR5 manipulator.</description>

      <title>User-Intent-Driven Semantic Communication via Adaptive Deep Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication focuses on transmitting task-relevant semantic information, aiming for intent-oriented communication. While existing systems improve efficiency by extracting key semantics, they still fail to deeply understand and generalize users' real intentions. To overcome this, we propose a user-intention-driven semantic communication system that interprets diverse abstract intents. First, we integrate a multi-modal large model as semantic knowledge base to generate user-intention prior. Next, a mask-guided attention module is proposed to effectively highlight critical semantic regions. Further, a channel state awareness module ensures adaptive, robust transmission across varying channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system achieves deep intent understanding and outperforms DeepJSCC, e.g., under a Rayleigh channel at an SNR of 5 dB, it achieves improvements of 8%, 6%, and 19% in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, respectively.</description>

      <title>Bayesian-Driven Graph Reasoning for Active Radio Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms. Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent, non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Efficient Real-Time Aircraft ETA Prediction via Feature Tokenization Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimated time of arrival (ETA) for airborne aircraft in real-time is crucial for arrival management in aviation, particularly for runway sequencing. Given the rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as important as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system. In this study, we utilize a feature tokenization-based Transformer model to efficiently predict aircraft ETA. Feature tokenization projects raw inputs to latent spaces, while the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Transformer captures important aspects of the projections, alleviating the need for complex feature engineering. Moreover, the Transformer's parallel computation capability allows it to handle ETA requests at a high frequency, i.e., 1HZ, which is essential for a real-time arrival management system. The model inputs include raw data, such as aircraft latitude, longitude, ground speed, theta degree for the airport, day and hour from track data, the weather context, and aircraft wake turbulence category. With a data sampling rate of 1HZ, the ETA prediction is updated every second. We apply the proposed aircraft ETA prediction approach to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO Code: WSSS) using one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data from October 1 to October 31, 2022. In the experimental evaluation, the ETA modeling covers all aircraft within a range of 10NM to 300NM from WSSS. The results show that our proposed method method outperforms the commonly used boosting tree based model, improving accuracy by 7\% compared to XGBoost, while requiring only 39\% of its computing time. Experimental results also indicate that, with 40 aircraft in the airspace at a given timestamp, the ETA inference time is only 51.7 microseconds, making it promising for real-time arrival management systems.</description>

      <title>To Theoretically Understand Transformer-Based In-Context Learning for Optimizing CSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09146v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The binary exponential backoff scheme is widely used in WiFi 7 and still incurs poor throughput performance under dynamic channel environments. Recent model-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply optimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading to a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL) theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt. We prove that our optimizer maintains minimal prediction and throughput deviations from the optimal values. Experimental results on NS-3 further demonstrate our approach's fast convergence and near-optimal throughput over existing model-based and DRL-based approaches under unknown node densities.</description>

      <title>Agentic TinyML for Intent-aware Handover in 6G Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As 6G networks evolve into increasingly AI-driven, user-centric ecosystems, traditional reactive handover mechanisms demonstrate limitations, especially in mobile edge computing and autonomous agent-based service scenarios. This manuscript introduces WAAN, a cross-layer framework that enables intent-aware and proactive handovers by embedding lightweight TinyML agents as autonomous, negotiation-capable entities across heterogeneous edge nodes that contribute to intent propagation and network adaptation. To ensure continuity across mobility-induced disruptions, WAAN incorporates semi-stable rendezvous points that serve as coordination anchors for context transfer and state preservation. The framework's operational capabilities are demonstrated through a multimodal environmental control case study, highlighting its effectiveness in maintaining user experience under mobility. Finally, the article discusses key challenges and future opportunities associated with the deployment and evolution of WAAN.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet developing an effective foundational LLM that balances high performance with computational efficiency remains challenging, especially for emerging research groups. To address this gap, we introduce Motif-2.6B, a 2.6-billion-parameter foundation model designed to democratize advanced LLM capabilities. Motif-2.6B incorporates several innovative architectural enhancements, including Differential Attention and PolyNorm activation functions, which improve long-context comprehension, reduce hallucination, and enhance in-context learning capabilities. We rigorously tested multiple novel architectural components through extensive experimentation to determine the optimal architecture for Motif-2.6B. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Motif-2.6B consistently meets or exceeds the performance of similarly sized state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness, scalability, and real-world applicability. Through detailed experiments and tailored techniques, Motif-2.6B significantly advances the landscape of efficient, scalable, and powerful foundational LLMs, offering valuable insights and a robust foundation for future research and deployment.</description>

      <title>5G Core Fault Detection and Root Cause Analysis using Machine Learning and Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of 5G networks and technologies, ensuring the integrity and performance of packet core traffic is paramount. During network analysis, test files such as Packet Capture (PCAP) files and log files will contain errors if present in the system that must be resolved for better overall network performance, such as connectivity strength and handover quality. Current methods require numerous person-hours to sort out testing results and find the faults. This paper presents a novel AI/ML-driven Fault Analysis (FA) Engine designed to classify successful and faulty frames in PCAP files, specifically within the 5G packet core. The FA engine analyses network traffic using natural language processing techniques to identify anomalies and inefficiencies, significantly reducing the effort time required and increasing efficiency. The FA Engine also suggests steps to fix the issue using Generative AI via a Large Language Model (LLM) trained on several 5G packet core documents. The engine explains the details of the error from the domain perspective using documents such as the 3GPP standards and user documents regarding the internal conditions of the tests. Test results on the ML models show high classification accuracy on the test dataset when trained with 80-20 splits for the successful and failed PCAP files. Future scopes include extending the AI engine to incorporate 4G network traffic and other forms of network data, such as log text files and multimodal systems.</description>

      <title>JustDense: Just using Dense instead of Sequence Mixer for Time Series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequence and channel mixers, the core mechanism in sequence models, have become the de facto standard in time series analysis (TSA). However, recent studies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as attention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve comparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits attributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other architectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a central question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series analysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that systematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models with dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any sequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This substitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical foundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive experiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven state-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show that replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even superior performance. In the cases where dedicated sequence mixers still offer benefits, JustDense challenges the assumption that "deeper and more complex architectures are inherently better" in TSA.</description>

      <title>Peer Effect Estimation in the Presence of Simultaneous Feedback and Unobserved Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating peer causal effects within complex real-world networks such as social networks is challenging, primarily due to simultaneous feedback between peers and unobserved confounders. Existing methods either address unobserved confounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback but under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer effect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning framework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an instrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback and unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and high-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to disentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the simultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct valid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on these IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the unobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network augmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as a control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no residual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in capturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances the effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and hidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard regularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect. Empirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.</description>

      <title>A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss: Adaptive Policy Optimization for Stable Self-Evaluation in Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-evaluation, a model's ability to assess the correctness of its own output, is crucial for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to achieve self-improvement in multi-turn conversations, yet largely absent in foundation models. Recent work has employed reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance self-evaluation; however, its fixed reward mechanism suffers from reward hacking when optimizing multiple training objectives, leading to model collapse. In this paper we propose AdaPO, an online reinforcement learning framework capable of adaptively adjusting training objective in real time according to the current training state for each task. Specifically, to mitigate reward hacking , AdaPO introduces an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and a Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization mechanism. ARM assesses the task's training state from the distribution of model generated multi-turn trajectories' performance. Reward Aware Dynamic KL replaces a fixed penalty with dynamic coefficients which is modulated by the reward gap between different multi-turn situations. Notably, our method automatically and smoothly adjusts its learning focus based on sub-tasks' training progress without manual intervention. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks and various models show that our method significantly enhances both direct reasoning and self-evaluation capability. We will release our code to contribute to the community.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Fine-Tuning of Flow-Matching Models for Generation and Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems. Starting from a model trained on low-fidelity or observational data, we apply a differentiable post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of governing partial differential equations (PDEs), promoting physical consistency and adherence to boundary conditions without distorting the underlying learned distribution. To infer unknown physical inputs, such as source terms, material parameters, or boundary data, we augment the generative process with a learnable latent parameter predictor and propose a joint optimization strategy. The resulting model produces physically valid field solutions alongside plausible estimates of hidden parameters, effectively addressing ill-posed inverse problems in a data-driven yet physicsaware manner. We validate our method on canonical PDE benchmarks, demonstrating improved satisfaction of PDE constraints and accurate recovery of latent coefficients. Our approach bridges generative modelling and scientific inference, opening new avenues for simulation-augmented discovery and data-efficient modelling of physical systems.</description>

      <title>EvaDrive: Evolutionary Adversarial Policy Optimization for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09158v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving faces significant challenges in achieving human-like iterative decision-making, which continuously generates, evaluates, and refines trajectory proposals. Current generation-evaluation frameworks isolate trajectory generation from quality assessment, preventing iterative refinement essential for planning, while reinforcement learning methods collapse multi-dimensional preferences into scalar rewards, obscuring critical trade-offs and yielding scalarization bias.To overcome these issues, we present EvaDrive, a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that establishes genuine closed-loop co-evolution between trajectory generation and evaluation via adversarial optimization. EvaDrive frames trajectory planning as a multi-round adversarial game. In this game, a hierarchical generator continuously proposes candidate paths by combining autoregressive intent modeling for temporal causality with diffusion-based refinement for spatial flexibility. These proposals are then rigorously assessed by a trainable multi-objective critic that explicitly preserves diverse preference structures without collapsing them into a single scalarization bias.This adversarial interplay, guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, enables iterative multi-round refinement, effectively escaping local optima while preserving trajectory diversity.Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving 94.9 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 (surpassing DiffusionDrive by 6.8, DriveSuprim by 5.0, and TrajHF by 0.9) and 64.96 Driving Score on Bench2Drive. EvaDrive generates diverse driving styles via dynamic weighting without external preference data, introducing a closed-loop adversarial framework for human-like iterative decision-making, offering a novel scalarization-free trajectory optimization approach.</description>

      <title>Agoran: An Agentic Open Marketplace for 6G RAN Automation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation mobile networks must reconcile the often-conflicting goals of multiple service owners. However, today's network slice controllers remain rigid, policy-bound, and unaware of the business context. We introduce Agoran Service and Resource Broker (SRB), an agentic marketplace that brings stakeholders directly into the operational loop. Inspired by the ancient Greek agora, Agoran distributes authority across three autonomous AI branches: a Legislative branch that answers compliance queries using retrieval-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs); an Executive branch that maintains real-time situational awareness through a watcher-updated vector database; and a Judicial branch that evaluates each agent message with a rule-based Trust Score, while arbitrating LLMs detect malicious behavior and apply real-time incentives to restore trust. Stakeholder-side Negotiation Agents and the SRB-side Mediator Agent negotiate feasible, Pareto-optimal offers produced by a multi-objective optimizer, reaching a consensus intent in a single round, which is then deployed to Open and AI RAN controllers. Deployed on a private 5G testbed and evaluated with realistic traces of vehicle mobility, Agoran achieved significant gains: (i) a 37% increase in throughput of eMBB slices, (ii) a 73% reduction in latency of URLLC slices, and concurrently (iii) an end-to-end 8.3% saving in PRB usage compared to a static baseline. An 1B-parameter Llama model, fine-tuned for five minutes on 100 GPT-4 dialogues, recovers approximately 80% of GPT-4.1's decision quality, while operating within 6 GiB of memory and converging in only 1.3 seconds. These results establish Agoran as a concrete, standards-aligned path toward ultra-flexible, stakeholder-centric 6G networks.

Abstract: Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient resource management and sustainability in the building sector. Deep learning models are highly successful but struggle with limited historical data and become unusable when historical data are unavailable, such as in newly constructed buildings. On the other hand, physics-based models, such as EnergyPlus, simulate energy consumption without relying on historical data but require extensive building parameter specifications and considerable time to model a building. This paper introduces a Physics-Guided Memory Network (PgMN), a neural network that integrates predictions from deep learning and physics-based models to address their limitations. PgMN comprises a Parallel Projection Layers to process incomplete inputs, a Memory Unit to account for persistent biases, and a Memory Experience Module to optimally extend forecasts beyond their input range and produce output. Theoretical evaluation shows that components of PgMN are mathematically valid for performing their respective tasks. The PgMN was evaluated on short-term energy forecasting at an hourly resolution, critical for operational decision-making in smart grid and smart building systems. Experimental validation shows accuracy and applicability of PgMN in diverse scenarios such as newly constructed buildings, missing data, sparse historical data, and dynamic infrastructure changes. This paper provides a promising solution for energy consumption forecasting in dynamic building environments, enhancing model applicability in scenarios where historical data are limited or unavailable or when physics-based models are inadequate.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Stochastic Computing (SC) Neural Networks for Internet of Things Devices With Layer-Wise Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) has emerged as an efficient low-power alternative for deploying neural networks (NNs) in resource-limited scenarios, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). By encoding values as serial bitstreams, SC significantly reduces energy dissipation compared to conventional floating-point (FP) designs; however, further improvement of layer-wise mixed-precision implementation for SC remains unexplored. This article introduces Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL), a novel scheme that applies mixed-precision concepts specifically to SC NNs. By introducing an operator-norm-based theoretical model, this article shows that truncation noise can cumulatively propagate through the layers by the estimated amplification factors. An extended sensitivity analysis is presented, using random forest (RF) regression to evaluate multilayer truncation effects and validate the alignment of theoretical predictions with practical network behaviors. To accommodate different application scenarios, this article proposes two truncation strategies (coarse-grained and fine-grained), which apply diverse sequence length configurations at each layer. Evaluations on a pipelined SC MLP synthesized at 32nm demonstrate that ASL can reduce energy and latency overheads by up to over 60% with negligible accuracy loss. It confirms the feasibility of the ASL scheme for IoT applications and highlights the distinct advantages of mixed-precision truncation in SC designs.</description>

      <title>Multimodal RAG Enhanced Visual Description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently. During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.</description>

      <title>webMCP: Efficient AI-Native Client-Side Interaction for Agent-Ready Web Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current AI agents create significant barriers for users by requiring extensive processing to understand web pages, making AI-assisted web interaction slow and expensive. This paper introduces webMCP (Web Machine Context &amp; Procedure), a client-side standard that embeds structured interaction metadata directly into web pages, enabling more efficient human-AI collaboration on existing websites. webMCP transforms how AI agents understand web interfaces by providing explicit mappings between page elements and user actions. Instead of processing entire HTML documents, agents can access pre-structured interaction data, dramatically reducing computational overhead while maintaining task accuracy. A comprehensive evaluation across 1,890 real API calls spanning online shopping, authentication, and content management scenarios demonstrates webMCP reduces processing requirements by 67.6% while maintaining 97.9% task success rates compared to 98.8% for traditional approaches. Users experience significantly lower costs (34-63% reduction) and faster response times across diverse web interactions. Statistical analysis confirms these improvements are highly significant across multiple AI models. An independent WordPress deployment study validates practical applicability, showing consistent improvements across real-world content management workflows. webMCP requires no server-side modifications, making it deployable across millions of existing websites without technical barriers. These results establish webMCP as a viable solution for making AI web assistance more accessible and sustainable, addressing the critical gap between user interaction needs and AI computational requirements in production environments.</description>

      <title>FedMP: Tackling Medical Feature Heterogeneity in Federated Learning from a Manifold Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm in which multiple clients collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their local private data. However, real-world applications of FL frequently encounter challenges arising from the non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) local datasets across participating clients, which is particularly pronounced in the field of medical imaging, where shifts in image feature distributions significantly hinder the global model's convergence and performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedMP, a novel method designed to enhance FL under non-IID scenarios. FedMP employs stochastic feature manifold completion to enrich the training space of individual client classifiers, and leverages class-prototypes to guide the alignment of feature manifolds across clients within semantically consistent subspaces, facilitating the construction of more distinct decision boundaries. We validate the effectiveness of FedMP on multiple medical imaging datasets, including those with real-world multi-center distributions, as well as on a multi-domain natural image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that FedMP outperforms existing FL algorithms. Additionally, we analyze the impact of manifold dimensionality, communication efficiency, and privacy implications of feature exposure in our method.</description>

      <title>A Context-aware Attention and Graph Neural Network-based Multimodal Framework for Misogyny Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module (MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and 13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>DQT: Dynamic Quantization Training via Dequantization-Free Nested Integer Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices relies on quantization. While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width to all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic, instance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed. However, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly dequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision, breaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains. This paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework that removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer representation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within higher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only arithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost bit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable both dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and truly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight controller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate DQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on ImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1 accuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET, 76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this with a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a drastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) floating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a new frontier in efficient, adaptive AI.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging: Foundations, Progress, and Clinical Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming medical imaging by enabling capabilities such as data synthesis, image enhancement, modality translation, and spatiotemporal modeling. This review presents a comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of recent advances in generative modeling including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), diffusion models, and emerging multimodal foundation architectures and evaluates their expanding roles across the clinical imaging continuum. We systematically examine how generative AI contributes to key stages of the imaging workflow, from acquisition and reconstruction to cross-modality synthesis, diagnostic support, and treatment planning. Emphasis is placed on both retrospective and prospective clinical scenarios, where generative models help address longstanding challenges such as data scarcity, standardization, and integration across modalities. To promote rigorous benchmarking and translational readiness, we propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing pixel-level fidelity, feature-level realism, and task-level clinical relevance. We also identify critical obstacles to real-world deployment, including generalization under domain shift, hallucination risk, data privacy concerns, and regulatory hurdles. Finally, we explore the convergence of generative AI with large-scale foundation models, highlighting how this synergy may enable the next generation of scalable, reliable, and clinically integrated imaging systems. By charting technical progress and translational pathways, this review aims to guide future research and foster interdisciplinary collaboration at the intersection of AI, medicine, and biomedical engineering.</description>

      <title>IAD-R1: Reinforcing Consistent Reasoning in Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09178v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing, yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT) stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset (Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves significant improvements across 7 VLMs, the largest improvement was on the DAGM dataset, with average accuracy 43.3% higher than the 0.5B baseline. Notably, the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.</description>

      <title>scAGC: Learning Adaptive Cell Graphs with Contrastive Guidance for Single-Cell Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which provides valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity. However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero elements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant statistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph neural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static graph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the long-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these limitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. Our approach optimizes feature representations and cell graphs simultaneously in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we introduce a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder that leverages a differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to dynamically refine the graph structure during training. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the problem of a long-tailed degree distribution by promoting a more balanced neighborhood structure. To model the discrete, over-dispersed, and zero-inflated nature of scRNA-seq data, we integrate a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss for robust feature reconstruction. Furthermore, a contrastive learning objective is incorporated to regularize the graph learning process and prevent abrupt changes in the graph topology, ensuring stability and enhancing convergence. Comprehensive experiments on 9 real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scAGC consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, yielding the best NMI and ARI scores on 9 and 7 datasets, respectively.Our code is available at Anonymous Github.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Client Selection for Federated Learning with Non-IID Data: A Truthful Auction Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a decentralized framework that enables universal model training through collaborative efforts on mobile nodes, such as smart vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Each smart vehicle acts as a mobile client, contributing to the process without uploading local data. This method leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training data from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and environmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and accuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID issues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics. Traditional metrics evaluate client data quality independently per round and require client selection after all clients complete local training, leading to resource wastage from unused training results. In the IoV context, where vehicles have limited connectivity and computational resources, information asymmetry in client selection risks clients submitting false information, potentially making the selection ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Long-term Client-Selection Federated Learning based on Truthful Auction (LCSFLA). This scheme maximizes social welfare with consideration of long-term data quality using a new assessment mechanism and energy costs, and the advised auction mechanism with a deposit requirement incentivizes client participation and ensures information truthfulness. We theoretically prove the incentive compatibility and individual rationality of the advised incentive mechanism. Experimental results on various datasets, including those from IoV scenarios, demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating performance degradation caused by non-IID data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation has demonstrated a promising alternative to solving the NP-hard combinatorial problems. Specifically, when it comes to optimization, classical approaches become intractable to account for large-scale solutions. Specifically, we investigate quantum computing to solve the large-scale Capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (CPDPTW). In this regard, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework augmented with a Parametrized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is designed to minimize the travel time in a realistic last-mile on-demand delivery. A novel problem-specific encoding quantum circuit with an entangling and variational layer is proposed. Moreover, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) are designed for comparison through numerical experiments, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the scale of the solution and training complexity while incorporating the real-world constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular traffic forecasting is essential for network planning, resource allocation, or load-balancing traffic across cells. However, accurate forecasting is difficult due to intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist due to the mobility of users. Existing AI-based traffic forecasting models often trade-off accuracy and computational efficiency. We present Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Mamba (HiSTM), which combines a dual spatial encoder with a Mamba-based temporal module and attention mechanism. HiSTM employs selective state space methods to capture spatial and temporal patterns in network traffic. In our evaluation, we use a real-world dataset to compare HiSTM against several baselines, showing a 29.4% MAE improvement over the STN baseline while using 94% fewer parameters. We show that the HiSTM generalizes well across different datasets and improves in accuracy over longer time-horizons.</description>

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper, we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge, salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method -- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and interpretable cognitive attack detection.</description>

      <title>RL-MoE: An Image-Based Privacy Preserving Approach In Intelligent Transportation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and autonomous vehicle networks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid(Transformer+CNN)-based Polyp Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colonoscopy is still the main method of detection and segmentation of colonic polyps, and recent advancements in deep learning networks such as U-Net, ResUNet, Swin-UNet, and PraNet have made outstanding performance in polyp segmentation. Yet, the problem is extremely challenging due to high variation in size, shape, endoscopy types, lighting, imaging protocols, and ill-defined boundaries (fluid, folds) of the polyps, rendering accurate segmentation a challenging and problematic task. To address these critical challenges in polyp segmentation, we introduce a hybrid (Transformer + CNN) model that is crafted to enhance robustness against evolving polyp characteristics. Our hybrid architecture demonstrates superior performance over existing solutions, particularly in addressing two critical challenges: (1) accurate segmentation of polyps with ill-defined margins through boundary-aware attention mechanisms, and (2) robust feature extraction in the presence of common endoscopic artifacts, including specular highlights, motion blur, and fluid occlusions. Quantitative evaluations reveal significant improvements in segmentation accuracy (Recall improved by 1.76%, i.e., 0.9555, accuracy improved by 0.07%, i.e., 0.9849) and artifact resilience compared to state-of-the-art polyp segmentation methods.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Safety Neurons with Training-Free Continual Projection to Reduce LLM Fine Tuning Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.</description>

      <title>From Values to Tokens: An LLM-Driven Framework for Context-aware Time Series Forecasting via Symbolic Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in supporting decision-making across a wide range of critical applications, including energy, healthcare, and finance. Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language model (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives. Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.</description>

      <title>Diffusion LLMs Can Do Faster-Than-AR Inference via Discrete Diffusion Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential to decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing open-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of similar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective strategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key capabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache utilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of prior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs are refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference. D2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on pre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm, which enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F dLLMs achieve more than $\mathbf{2.5\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the acceleration can be more than $\mathbf{50\times}$ while maintaining comparable output quality.

      <title>Multi-Objective Instruction-Aware Representation Learning in Procedural Content Generation RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling emphasize the importance of natural language as a highly expressive and accessible modality for controlling content generation. However, existing instructed reinforcement learning for procedural content generation (IPCGRL) method often struggle to leverage the expressive richness of textual input, especially under complex, multi-objective instructions, leading to limited controllability. To address this problem, we propose \textit{MIPCGRL}, a multi-objective representation learning method for instructed content generators, which incorporates sentence embeddings as conditions. MIPCGRL effectively trains a multi-objective embedding space by incorporating multi-label classification and multi-head regression networks. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to a 13.8\% improvement in controllability with multi-objective instructions. The ability to process complex instructions enables more expressive and flexible content generation.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning for Speeding Up Large Model Inference in Decentralized Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of large-scale models, such as large language models (LLMs), incurs substantial costs due to their computational demands. To mitigate these costs and address challenges related to scalability and data security, there is a growing shift towards decentralized systems for model deployment, where choosing efficient inference acceleration schemes become crucial to manage computational resources effectively and enhance system responsiveness. In this work, we address the challenge of selecting optimal acceleration methods in decentralized systems by introducing a meta-learning-based framework. This framework automates the selection process by learning from historical performance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition, our approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based on the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our meta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but also consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and performance. Our results highlight the potential of inference acceleration in decentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and economically feasible artificial intelligence solutions.</description>

      <title>impuTMAE: Multi-modal Transformer with Masked Pre-training for Missing Modalities Imputation in Cancer Survival Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of diverse modalities, such as omics, medical images, and clinical data can not only improve the performance of prognostic models but also deepen an understanding of disease mechanisms and facilitate the development of novel treatment approaches. However, medical data are complex, often incomplete, and contains missing modalities, making effective handling its crucial for training multimodal models. We introduce impuTMAE, a novel transformer-based end-to-end approach with an efficient multimodal pre-training strategy. It learns inter- and intra-modal interactions while simultaneously imputing missing modalities by reconstructing masked patches. Our model is pre-trained on heterogeneous, incomplete data and fine-tuned for glioma survival prediction using TCGA-GBM/LGG and BraTS datasets, integrating five modalities: genetic (DNAm, RNA-seq), imaging (MRI, WSI), and clinical data. By addressing missing data during pre-training and enabling efficient resource utilization, impuTMAE surpasses prior multimodal approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in glioma patient survival prediction.

      <title>FIVA: Federated Inverse Variance Averaging for Universal CT Segmentation with Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different CT segmentation datasets are typically obtained from different scanners under different capture settings and often provide segmentation labels for a limited and often disjoint set of organs. Using these heterogeneous data effectively while preserving patient privacy can be challenging. This work presents a novel federated learning approach to achieve universal segmentation across diverse abdominal CT datasets by utilizing model uncertainty for aggregation and predictive uncertainty for inference. Our approach leverages the inherent noise in stochastic mini-batch gradient descent to estimate a distribution over the model weights to provide an on-the-go uncertainty over the model parameters at the client level. The parameters are then aggregated at the server using the additional uncertainty information using a Bayesian-inspired inverse-variance aggregation scheme. Furthermore, the proposed method quantifies prediction uncertainty by propagating the uncertainty from the model weights, providing confidence measures essential for clinical decision-making. In line with recent work shown, predictive uncertainty is utilized in the inference stage to improve predictive performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in improving both the quality of federated aggregation and uncertainty-weighted inference compared to previously established baselines.

      <description>arXiv:2508.09197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future 6G radio access networks (RANs) will be artificial intelligence (AI)-native: observed, reasoned about, and re-configured by autonomous agents cooperating across the cloud-edge continuum. We introduce MX-AI, the first end-to-end agentic system that (i) instruments a live 5G Open RAN testbed based on OpenAirInterface (OAI) and FlexRIC, (ii) deploys a graph of Large-Language-Model (LLM)-powered agents inside the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) layer, and (iii) exposes both observability and control functions for 6G RAN resources through natural-language intents. On 50 realistic operational queries, MX-AI attains a mean answer quality of 4.1/5.0 and 100 % decision-action accuracy, while incurring only 8.8 seconds end-to-end latency when backed by GPT-4.1. Thus, it matches human-expert performance, validating its practicality in real settings. We publicly release the agent graph, prompts, and evaluation harness to accelerate open research on AI-native RANs.

      <title>ADT4Coupons: An Innovative Framework for Sequential Coupon Distribution in E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupon distribution is a critical marketing strategy used by online platforms to boost revenue and enhance user engagement. Regrettably, existing coupon distribution strategies fall far short of effectively leveraging the complex sequential interactions between platforms and users. This critical oversight, despite the abundance of e-commerce log data, has precipitated a performance plateau. In this paper, we focus on the scene that the platforms make sequential coupon distribution decision multiple times for various users, with each user interacting with the platform repeatedly. Based on this marketing scenario, we propose a novel marketing framework, named Aligned Decision Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons), to directly devise coupon distribution policy for long-term revenue boosting. ADT4Coupons enables optimized online decision-making in a variety of real-world marketing scenarios. It achieves this by seamlessly integrating three key characteristics, general scenarios, sequential modeling with more comprehensive historical data, and efficient iterative updates within a unified framework. Furthermore, empirical results on real-world industrial dataset, alongside public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework.</description>

      <title>$\Delta$-AttnMask: Attention-Guided Masked Hidden States for Efficient Data Selection and Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that $\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data, accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1% in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad applicability across modalities and architectures.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot self-supervised learning of single breath-hold magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of applying zero-shot self-supervised learning reconstruction to reduce breath-hold times in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Methods: Breath-hold MRCP was acquired from 11 healthy volunteers on a 3T scanner using an incoherent k-space sampling pattern leading to a breath-hold duration of 14s. We evaluated zero-shot reconstruction of breath-hold MRCP against parallel imaging of respiratory-triggered MRCP acquired in 338s on average and compressed sensing reconstruction of breath-hold MRCP. To address the long computation times of zero-shot trainings, we used a training approach that leverages a pretrained network to reduce backpropagation depth during training. Results: Zero-shot learning reconstruction significantly improved visual image quality compared to compressed sensing reconstruction, particularly in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and ductal delineation, and reached a level of quality comparable to that of successful respiratory-triggered acquisitions with regular breathing patterns. Shallow training provided nearly equivalent reconstruction performance with a training time of 11 minutes in comparison to 271 minutes for a conventional zero-shot training. Conclusion: Zero-shot learning delivers high-fidelity MRCP reconstructions with reduced breath-hold times, and shallow training offers a practical solution for translation to time-constrained clinical workflows.</description>

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. Although recent detection works have shifted to internal representations due to their rich cross-modal information, most methods rely on heuristic rules rather than principled objectives, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a novel unsupervised framework that formulates jailbreak detection as anomaly detection. LoD introduces two key components: Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vectors (MSCAV), which capture layer-wise safety-related representations across modalities, and the Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder, which models the distribution of MSCAV derived from safe inputs and detects anomalies via reconstruction errors. By training the auto-encoder (AE) solely on safe samples without attack labels, LoD naturally identifies jailbreak inputs as distributional anomalies, enabling accurate and unified detection of jailbreak attacks. Comprehensive experiments on three different LVLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate that LoD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average AUROC of 0.9951 and an improvement of up to 38.89% in the minimum AUROC over the strongest baselines.</description>

      <title>Personalized Feature Translation for Expression Recognition: An Efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09202v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy, storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class. Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another. Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.</description>

      <title>MoQE: Improve Quantization Model performance via Mixture of Quantization Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models. We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.</description>

      <title>From Explainable to Explained AI: Ideas for Falsifying and Quantifying Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining deep learning models is essential for clinical integration of medical image analysis systems. A good explanation highlights if a model depends on spurious features that undermines generalization and harms a subset of patients or, conversely, may present novel biological insights. Although techniques like GradCAM can identify influential features, they are measurement tools that do not themselves form an explanation. We propose a human-machine-VLM interaction system tailored to explaining classifiers in computational pathology, including multi-instance learning for whole-slide images. Our proof of concept comprises (1) an AI-integrated slide viewer to run sliding-window experiments to test claims of an explanation, and (2) quantification of an explanation's predictiveness using general-purpose vision-language models. The results demonstrate that this allows us to qualitatively test claims of explanations and can quantifiably distinguish competing explanations. This offers a practical path from explainable AI to explained AI in digital pathology and beyond. Code and prompts are available at https://github.com/nki-ai/x2x.</description>

      <title>CoMoE: Collaborative Optimization of Expert Aggregation and Offloading for MoE-based LLMs at Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has driven the adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures as a promising solution to scale model capacity while controlling computational costs. However, deploying MoE models in resource-constrained mobile edge computing environments presents significant challenges due to their large memory footprint and dynamic expert activation patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dynamic resource-aware collaborative optimization framework that jointly optimizes expert aggregation granularity and offloading strategies based on real-time device resource states, network conditions, and input characteristics in mobile edge environments, denoted as CoMoE. In CoMoE, we first systematically analyze existing expert aggregation techniques, including expert parameter merging,knowledge distillation,and parameter sharing decomposition, identifying their limitations in dynamic mobile environments.We then investigate expert offloading strategies encompassing expert prediction and prefetching, expert caching and scheduling, and multi-tier storage architectures, revealing the interdependencies between routing decisions and offloading performance.The CoMoE incorporates adaptive scheduling mechanisms that respond to user mobility and varying network conditions, enabling efficient MoE deployment across heterogeneous edge devices. Extensive experiments on real mobile edge testbeds demonstrate that CoMoE achieves approximately 70% reduction in memory usage compared to baseline methods, 10.5% lower inference latency than existing expert offloading techniques, while maintaining model performance stability. For large-scale MoE models (e.g,7.4B-parameter Switch-Base-128), the CoMoE reduces memory requirements from 15.6GB to 4.7GB, enabling deployment on resource-constrained mobile edge devices that previously could only support much smaller models.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks: Comparative Analysis of Classical and Hybrid Quantum-Classical Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for producing high-fidelity data samples, yet their performance is constrained by the quality of latent representations, typically sampled from classical noise distributions. This study investigates hybrid quantum-classical GANs (HQCGANs) in which a quantum generator, implemented via parameterised quantum circuits, produces latent vectors for a classical discriminator. We evaluate a classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware. Models are trained for 150 epochs and assessed with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID). Results show that while the classical GAN achieved the best scores, the 7-qubit HQCGAN produced competitive performance, narrowing the gap in later epochs, whereas the 3-qubit model exhibited earlier convergence limitations. Efficiency analysis indicates only moderate training time increases despite quantum sampling overhead. These findings validate the feasibility of noisy quantum circuits as latent priors in GAN architectures, highlighting their potential to enhance generative modelling within the constraints of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.</description>

      <title>MME-Emotion: A Holistic Evaluation Benchmark for Emotional Intelligence in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress, current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and \textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$ recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark. \ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion, we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional intelligence in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models open new avenues for simulating realistic genomic data while preserving privacy and addressing data accessibility constraints. While previous studies have primarily focused on generating gene expression or haplotype data, this study explores generating genotype data in both unconditioned and phenotype-conditioned settings, which is inherently more challenging due to the discrete nature of genotype data. In this work, we developed and evaluated commonly used generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Diffusion Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and proposed adaptation tailored to discrete genotype data. We conducted extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including all chromosomes from cow and multiple chromosomes from human. Model performance was assessed using a well-established set of metrics drawn from both deep learning and quantitative genetics literature. Our results show that these models can effectively capture genetic patterns and preserve genotype-phenotype association. Our findings provide a comprehensive comparison of these models and offer practical guidelines for future research in genotype simulation. We have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/SihanXXX/DiscreteGenoGen.</description>

      <title>Real-time deep learning phase imaging flow cytometer reveals blood cell aggregate biomarkers for haematology diagnostics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While analysing rare blood cell aggregates remains challenging in automated haematology, they could markedly advance label-free functional diagnostics. Conventional flow cytometers efficiently perform cell counting with leukocyte differentials but fail to identify aggregates with flagged results, requiring manual reviews. Quantitative phase imaging flow cytometry captures detailed aggregate morphologies, but clinical use is hampered by massive data storage and offline processing. Incorporating hidden biomarkers into routine haematology panels would significantly improve diagnostics without flagged results. We present RT-HAD, an end-to-end deep learning-based image and data processing framework for off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM), which combines physics-consistent holographic reconstruction and detection, representing each blood cell in a graph to recognize aggregates. RT-HAD processes &gt;30 GB of image data on-the-fly with turnaround time of &lt;1.5 min and error rate of 8.9% in platelet aggregate detection, which matches acceptable laboratory error rates of haematology biomarkers and solves the big data challenge for point-of-care diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective MLLM Jailbreaking Through Balanced On-Topicness and OOD-Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off: highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content. However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD). The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI applications have raised growing concerns about the need for ethical guidelines and regulations to mitigate the risks posed by these technologies. In this paper, we present a mixed-method survey study - combining statistical and qualitative analyses - to examine the ethical perceptions, practices, and knowledge of individuals involved in various AI development roles. Our survey includes 414 participants from 43 countries, representing roles such as AI managers, analysts, developers, quality assurance professionals, and information security and privacy experts. The results reveal varying degrees of familiarity and experience with AI ethics principles, government initiatives, and risk mitigation strategies across roles, regions, and other demographic factors. Our findings highlight the importance of a collaborative, role-sensitive approach, involving diverse stakeholders in ethical decision-making throughout the AI development lifecycle. We advocate for developing tailored, inclusive solutions to address ethical challenges in AI development, and we propose future research directions and educational strategies to promote ethics-aware AI practices.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Training for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of \textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression \textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80 million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller}, the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further research building upon our contributions.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Adaptive networks with Task vectors for Test-Time Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation allows pretrained models to adjust to incoming data streams, addressing distribution shifts between source and target domains. However, standard methods rely on single-dimensional linear classification layers, which often fail to handle diverse and complex shifts. We propose Hierarchical Adaptive Networks with Task Vectors (Hi-Vec), which leverages multiple layers of increasing size for dynamic test-time adaptation. By decomposing the encoder's representation space into such hierarchically organized layers, Hi-Vec, in a plug-and-play manner, allows existing methods to adapt to shifts of varying complexity. Our contributions are threefold: First, we propose dynamic layer selection for automatic identification of the optimal layer for adaptation to each test batch. Second, we propose a mechanism that merges weights from the dynamic layer to other layers, ensuring all layers receive target information. Third, we propose linear layer agreement that acts as a gating function, preventing erroneous fine-tuning by adaptation on noisy batches. We rigorously evaluate the performance of Hi-Vec in challenging scenarios and on multiple target datasets, proving its strong capability to advance state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that Hi-Vec improves robustness, addresses uncertainty, and handles limited batch sizes and increased outlier rates.</description>

      <title>From Hard Refusals to Safe-Completions: Toward Output-Centric Safety Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models used in ChatGPT have traditionally been trained to learn a refusal boundary: depending on the user's intent, the model is taught to either fully comply or outright refuse. While this is a strong mitigation for explicitly malicious prompts, focusing safety training on refusals can lead to brittleness for prompts with obscured user intent. Binary refusal boundaries are especially ill-suited for dual-use cases (such as biology or cybersecurity), where a user request can be answered safely at a high level, but in some cases can lead to malicious uplift if sufficiently detailed or actionable. As an alternative, we propose safe-completions: a safety-training approach that centers on the safety of the assistant's output, rather than a binary classification of the user's intent. Safe-completions seek to maximize helpfulness within the safety policy's constraints. We incorporated this approach into GPT-5 and find that across both production comparisons and internally controlled experiments, safe-completion training improves safety (especially on dual-use prompts), reduces the severity of residual safety failures, and substantially increases model helpfulness.</description>

      <title>AMRG: Extend Vision Language Models for Automatic Mammography Report Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mammography report generation is a critical yet underexplored task in medical AI, characterized by challenges such as multiview image reasoning, high-resolution visual cues, and unstructured radiologic language. In this work, we introduce AMRG (Automatic Mammography Report Generation), the first end-to-end framework for generating narrative mammography reports using large vision-language models (VLMs). Building upon MedGemma-4B-it-a domain-specialized, instruction-tuned VLM-we employ a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling lightweight adaptation with minimal computational overhead. We train and evaluate AMRG on DMID, a publicly available dataset of paired high-resolution mammograms and diagnostic reports. This work establishes the first reproducible benchmark for mammography report generation, addressing a longstanding gap in multimodal clinical AI. We systematically explore LoRA hyperparameter configurations and conduct comparative experiments across multiple VLM backbones, including both domain-specific and general-purpose models under a unified tuning protocol. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across both language generation and clinical metrics, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.5691, METEOR of 0.6152, CIDEr of 0.5818, and BI-RADS accuracy of 0.5582. Qualitative analysis further highlights improved diagnostic consistency and reduced hallucinations. AMRG offers a scalable and adaptable foundation for radiology report generation and paves the way for future research in multimodal medical AI.</description>

      <title>GSMT: Graph Fusion and Spatiotemporal TaskCorrection for Multi-Bus Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction for buses is crucial in intelligent transportation systems, particularly within urban environments. In developing regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Cluster Topology-Driven Placement of Experts Reduces Network Traffic in MoE Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient deployment of a pre-trained LLM to a cluster with multiple servers is a critical step for providing fast responses to users' queries. The recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs raises the question of how to deploy them efficiently, considering their underlying structure. During the inference in MoE LLMs, only a small part of the experts is selected to process a given token. Moreover, in practice, the experts' load is highly imbalanced. For efficient deployment, one has to distribute the model across a large number of servers using a model placement algorithm. Thus, to improve cluster utilization, the model placement algorithm has to take into account the network topology. This work focuses on the efficient topology-aware placement of the pre-trained MoE LLMs in the inference stage. We propose an integer linear program (ILP) that determines the optimal placement of experts, minimizing the expected number of transmissions. Due to the internal structure, this optimization problem can be solved with a standard ILP solver. We demonstrate that ILP-based placement strategy yields lower network traffic than competitors for small-scale (DeepSeekMoE~16B) and large-scale (DeepSeek-R1~671B) models.</description>

      <title>Cowpox: Towards the Immunity of VLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Model (VLM)-based agents are stateful, autonomous entities capable of perceiving and interacting with their environments through vision and language. Multi-agent systems comprise specialized agents who collaborate to solve a (complex) task. A core security property is robustness, stating that the system should maintain its integrity under adversarial attacks. However, the design of existing multi-agent systems lacks the robustness consideration, as a successful exploit against one agent can spread and infect other agents to undermine the entire system's assurance. To address this, we propose a new defense approach, Cowpox, to provably enhance the robustness of multi-agent systems. It incorporates a distributed mechanism, which improves the recovery rate of agents by limiting the expected number of infections to other agents. The core idea is to generate and distribute a special cure sample that immunizes an agent against the attack before exposure and helps recover the already infected agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Cowpox empirically and provide theoretical robustness guarantees.</description>

      <title>Beyond Technocratic XAI: The Who, What &amp; How in Explanation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of Explainable AI (XAI) offers a wide range of techniques for making complex models interpretable. Yet, in practice, generating meaningful explanations is a context-dependent task that requires intentional design choices to ensure accessibility and transparency. This paper reframes explanation as a situated design process -- an approach particularly relevant for practitioners involved in building and deploying explainable systems. Drawing on prior research and principles from design thinking, we propose a three-part framework for explanation design in XAI: asking Who needs the explanation, What they need explained, and How that explanation should be delivered. We also emphasize the need for ethical considerations, including risks of epistemic inequality, reinforcing social inequities, and obscuring accountability and governance. By treating explanation as a sociotechnical design process, this framework encourages a context-aware approach to XAI that supports effective communication and the development of ethically responsible explanations.</description>

      <title>PETLP: A Privacy-by-Design Pipeline for Social Media Data in AI Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media data presents AI researchers with overlapping obligations under the GDPR, copyright law, and platform terms -- yet existing frameworks fail to integrate these regulatory domains, leaving researchers without unified guidance. We introduce PETLP (Privacy-by-design Extract, Transform, Load, and Present), a compliance framework that embeds legal safeguards directly into extended ETL pipelines. Central to PETLP is treating Data Protection Impact Assessments as living documents that evolve from pre-registration through dissemination. Through systematic Reddit analysis, we demonstrate how extraction rights fundamentally differ between qualifying research organisations (who can invoke DSM Article 3 to override platform restrictions) and commercial entities (bound by terms of service), whilst GDPR obligations apply universally. We reveal why true anonymisation remains unachievable for social media data and expose the legal gap between permitted dataset creation and uncertain model distribution. By structuring compliance decisions into practical workflows and simplifying institutional data management plans, PETLP enables researchers to navigate regulatory complexity with confidence, bridging the gap between legal requirements and research practice.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Direction-Aware Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control. Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized Gaussians utilization.</description>

      <title>NEFMind: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Open-Source LLMs for Telecom APIs Automation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Service-Based Architecture in modern telecommunications has exponentially increased Network Functions (NFs) and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), creating substantial operational complexities in service discovery and management. We introduce \textit{NEFMind}, a framework leveraging parameter-efficient fine-tuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges. It integrates three core components: synthetic dataset generation from Network Exposure Function (NEF) API specifications, model optimization through Quantized-Low-Rank Adaptation, and performance evaluation via GPT-4 Ref Score and BertScore metrics. Targeting 5G Service-Based Architecture APIs, our approach achieves 85% reduction in communication overhead compared to manual discovery methods. Experimental validation using the open-source Phi-2 model demonstrates exceptional API call identification performance at 98-100% accuracy. The fine-tuned Phi-2 model delivers performance comparable to significantly larger models like GPT-4 while maintaining computational efficiency for telecommunications infrastructure deployment. These findings validate domain-specific, parameter-efficient LLM strategies for managing complex API ecosystems in next-generation telecommunications networks.</description>

      <title>Cross-BCI, A Cross-BCI-Paradigm Classifica-tion Model Towards Universal BCI Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification models used in brain-computer interface (BCI) are usually designed for a single BCI paradigm. This requires the redevelopment of the model when applying it to a new BCI paradigm, resulting in repeated costs and effort. Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical usage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the above gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a tempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature selec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms and generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature extraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are extracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to form high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The results, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI, SSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%, 80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and macro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models. This study pro-vides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm classifica-tion. It lays a technological foundation for de-veloping a new generation of unified decoding systems, paving the way for low-cost and universal practical applications.</description>

      <title>Detection of Odor Presence via Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Odor detection underpins food safety, environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and many more fields. The current artificial sensors developed for odor detection struggle with complex mixtures while non-invasive recordings lack reliable single-trial fidelity. To develop a general system for odor detection, in this study we present a preliminary work where we aim to test two hypotheses: (i) that spectral features of local field potentials (LFPs) are sufficient for robust single-trial odor detection and (ii) that signals from the olfactory bulb alone are adequate. To test two hypotheses, we propose an ensemble of complementary one-dimensional convolutional networks (ResCNN and AttentionCNN) that decodes the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory bulb LFPs. Tested on 2,349 trials from seven awake mice, our final ensemble model supports both hypotheses, achieving a mean accuracy of 86.6%, an F1-score of 81.0%, and an AUC of 0.9247, substantially outperforming previous benchmarks. In addition, the t-SNE visualization confirms that our framework captures biologically significant signatures. These findings establish the feasibility of robust single-trial detection of the presence of odor from extracellular LFPs, as well as demonstrate the potential of deep learning models to provide a deeper understanding of olfactory representations.</description>

      <title>Can AI Keep a Secret? Contextual Integrity Verification: A Provable Security Architecture for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain acutely vulnerable to prompt injection and related jailbreak attacks; heuristic guardrails (rules, filters, LLM judges) are routinely bypassed. We present Contextual Integrity Verification (CIV), an inference-time security architecture that attaches cryptographically signed provenance labels to every token and enforces a source-trust lattice inside the transformer via a pre-softmax hard attention mask (with optional FFN/residual gating). CIV provides deterministic, per-token non-interference guarantees on frozen models: lower-trust tokens cannot influence higher-trust representations. On benchmarks derived from recent taxonomies of prompt-injection vectors (Elite-Attack + SoK-246), CIV attains 0% attack success rate under the stated threat model while preserving 93.1% token-level similarity and showing no degradation in model perplexity on benign tasks; we note a latency overhead attributable to a non-optimized data path. Because CIV is a lightweight patch -- no fine-tuning required -- we demonstrate drop-in protection for Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B. We release a reference implementation, an automated certification harness, and the Elite-Attack corpus to support reproducible research.</description>

      <title>Ethical Medical Image Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of ethical Medical Image Synthesis (MISyn) is to ensure that the MISyn techniques are researched and developed ethically throughout their entire lifecycle, which is essential to prevent the negative impacts of MISyn. To address the ever-increasing needs and requirements for ethical practice of MISyn research and development, we first conduct a theoretical analysis that identifies the key properties of ethical MISyn and intrinsic limits of MISyn. We identify that synthetic images lack inherent grounding in real medical phenomena, cannot fully represent the training medical images, and inevitably introduce new distribution shifts and biases.
  Ethical risks can arise from not acknowledging the intrinsic limits and weaknesses of synthetic images compared to medical images, with the extreme form manifested as misinformation of MISyn that substitutes synthetic images for medical images without acknowledgment. The resulting ethical harms include eroding trust in the medical imaging dataset environment and causing algorithmic discrimination towards stakeholders and the public.
  To facilitate collective efforts towards ethical MISyn within and outside the medical image analysis community, we then propose practical supports for ethical practice in MISyn based on the theoretical analysis, including ethical practice recommendations that adapt the existing technical standards, problem formulation, design, and evaluation practice of MISyn to the ethical challenges; and oversight recommendations to facilitate checks and balances from stakeholders and the public. We also present two case studies that demonstrate how to apply the ethical practice recommendations in practice, and identify gaps between existing practice and the ethical practice recommendations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in speech synthesis intensify security threats, motivating real-time deepfake detection research. We investigate whether bidirectional Mamba can serve as a competitive alternative to Self-Attention in detecting synthetic speech. Our solution, Fake-Mamba, integrates an XLSR front-end with bidirectional Mamba to capture both local and global artifacts. Our core innovation introduces three efficient encoders: TransBiMamba, ConBiMamba, and PN-BiMamba. Leveraging XLSR's rich linguistic representations, PN-BiMamba can effectively capture the subtle cues of synthetic speech. Evaluated on ASVspoof 21 LA, 21 DF, and In-The-Wild benchmarks, Fake-Mamba achieves 0.97%, 1.74%, and 5.85% EER, respectively, representing substantial relative gains over SOTA models XLSR-Conformer and XLSR-Mamba. The framework maintains real-time inference across utterance lengths, demonstrating strong generalization and practical viability.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09297v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current AI systems minimize risk by enforcing ideological neutrality, yet this may introduce automation bias by suppressing cognitive engagement in human decision-making. We conducted randomized trials with 2,500 participants to test whether culturally biased AI enhances human decision-making. Participants interacted with politically diverse GPT-4o variants on information evaluation tasks. Partisan AI assistants enhanced human performance, increased engagement, and reduced evaluative bias compared to non-biased counterparts, with amplified benefits when participants encountered opposing views. These gains carried a trust penalty: participants underappreciated biased AI and overcredited neutral systems. Exposing participants to two AIs whose biases flanked human perspectives closed the perception-performance gap. These findings complicate conventional wisdom about AI neutrality, suggesting that strategic integration of diverse cultural biases may foster improved and resilient human decision-making.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Weather Forecasting via Distributed Machine Learning and Blockchain-Based Model Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09299v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a vital role in disaster preparedness, agriculture, and resource management, yet current centralized forecasting systems are increasingly strained by security vulnerabilities, limited scalability, and susceptibility to single points of failure. To address these challenges, we propose a decentralized weather forecasting framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) with blockchain technology. FL enables collaborative model training without exposing sensitive local data; this approach enhances privacy and reduces data transfer overhead. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain ensures transparent and dependable verification of model updates. To further enhance the system's security, we introduce a reputation-based voting mechanism that assesses the trustworthiness of submitted models while utilizing the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for efficient off-chain storage. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only improves forecasting accuracy but also enhances system resilience and scalability, making it a viable candidate for deployment in real-world, security-critical environments.</description>

      <title>ParallelSearch: Train your LLMs to Decompose Query and Search Sub-queries in Parallel with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents such as Search-R1, trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), demonstrate remarkable capabilities in multi-step information retrieval from external knowledge sources. These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by dynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural limitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when handling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This sequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency, particularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address this critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement learning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize parallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations concurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that incentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving answer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition quality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average performance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks. Notably, on parallelizable questions, our method achieves a 12.7% performance improvement while requiring only 69.6% of the LLM calls compared to sequential approaches.</description>

      <title>Exact Verification of Graph Neural Networks with Incremental Constraint Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions, sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time. Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Rare Disease Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the rare disease domain poses unique challenges due to limited labeled data, semantic ambiguity between entity types, and long-tail distributions. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of GPT-4o for rare disease NER under low-resource settings, using a range of prompt-based strategies including zero-shot prompting, few-shot in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and task-level fine-tuning. We design a structured prompting framework that encodes domain-specific knowledge and disambiguation rules for four entity types. We further introduce two semantically guided few-shot example selection methods to improve in-context performance while reducing labeling effort. Experiments on the RareDis Corpus show that GPT-4o achieves competitive or superior performance compared to BioClinicalBERT, with task-level fine-tuning yielding new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Cost-performance analysis reveals that few-shot prompting delivers high returns at low token budgets, while RAG offers marginal additional benefit. An error taxonomy highlights common failure modes such as boundary drift and type confusion, suggesting opportunities for post-processing and hybrid refinement. Our results demonstrate that prompt-optimized LLMs can serve as effective, scalable alternatives to traditional supervised models in biomedical NER, particularly in rare disease applications where annotated data is scarce.</description>

      <title>TEN: Table Explicitization, Neurosymbolically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neurosymbolic approach, TEN, for extracting tabular data from semistructured input text. This task is particularly challenging for text input that does not use special delimiters consistently to separate columns and rows. Purely neural approaches perform poorly due to hallucinations and their inability to enforce hard constraints. TEN uses Structural Decomposition prompting - a specialized chain-of-thought prompting approach - on a large language model (LLM) to generate an initial table, and thereafter uses a symbolic checker to evaluate not only the well-formedness of that table, but also detect cases of hallucinations or forgetting. The output of the symbolic checker is processed by a critique-LLM to generate guidance for fixing the table, which is presented to the original LLM in a self-debug loop. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that TEN significantly outperforms purely neural baselines across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving significantly higher exact match accuracy and substantially reduced hallucination rates. A 21-participant user study further confirms that TEN's tables are rated significantly more accurate (mean score: 5.0 vs 4.3; p = 0.021), and are consistently preferred for ease of verification and correction, with participants favoring our method in over 60% of the cases.</description>

      <title>SegDAC: Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic for Visual Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards. Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.</description>

      <title>Synaptic Pruning: A Biological Inspiration for Deep Learning Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology by progressively removing low-importance connections during training. Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p &lt; 0.01). In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models. This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to conventional dropout techniques.</description>

      <title>RicciFlowRec: A Geometric Root Cause Recommender Using Ricci Curvature on Financial Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose RicciFlowRec, a geometric recommendation framework that performs root cause attribution via Ricci curvature and flow on dynamic financial graphs. By modelling evolving interactions among stocks, macroeconomic indicators, and news, we quantify local stress using discrete Ricci curvature and trace shock propagation via Ricci flow. Curvature gradients reveal causal substructures, informing a structural risk-aware ranking function. Preliminary results on S\&amp;P~500 data with FinBERT-based sentiment show improved robustness and interpretability under synthetic perturbations. This ongoing work supports curvature-based attribution and early-stage risk-aware ranking, with plans for portfolio optimization and return forecasting. To our knowledge, RicciFlowRec is the first recommender to apply geometric flow-based reasoning in financial decision support.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics of strategic classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) are nowadays applied in high-stakes decisions in finance, healthcare, criminal justice, or education. Individuals can strategically adapt to the information gathered about classifiers, which in turn may require algorithms to be re-trained. Which collective dynamics will result from users' adaptation and algorithms' retraining? We apply evolutionary game theory to address this question. Our framework provides a mathematically rigorous way of treating the problem of feedback loops between collectives of users and institutions, allowing to test interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of strategic adaptation. As a case study, we consider institutions deploying algorithms for credit lending. We consider several scenarios, each representing different interaction paradigms. When algorithms are not robust against strategic manipulation, we are able to capture previous challenges discussed in the strategic classification literature, whereby users either pay excessive costs to meet the institutions' expectations (leading to high social costs) or game the algorithm (e.g., provide fake information). From this baseline setting, we test the role of improving gaming detection and providing algorithmic recourse. We show that increased detection capabilities reduce social costs and could lead to users' improvement; when perfect classifiers are not feasible (likely to occur in practice), algorithmic recourse can steer the dynamics towards high users' improvement rates. The speed at which the institutions re-adapt to the user's population plays a role in the final outcome. Finally, we explore a scenario where strict institutions provide actionable recourse to their unsuccessful users and observe cycling dynamics so far unnoticed in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Human-AI Hybrid Delphi Model: A Structured Framework for Context-Rich, Expert Consensus in Complex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expert consensus plays a critical role in domains where evidence is complex, conflicting, or insufficient for direct prescription. Traditional methods, such as Delphi studies, consensus conferences, and systematic guideline synthesis, offer structure but face limitations including high panel burden, interpretive oversimplification, and suppression of conditional nuance. These challenges are now exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base, and increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert filtering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi (HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by integrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior human experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three phases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied deployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed cardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus conclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human experts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In Phase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved &gt;90% consensus coverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI provided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence resolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a flexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive consensus. Its successful application across health, coaching, and performance science confirms its methodological robustness and supports its use as a foundation for generating conditional, personalised guidance and published consensus frameworks at scale.</description>

      <title>FusionEnsemble-Net: An Attention-Based Ensemble of Spatiotemporal Networks for Multimodal Sign Language Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net, a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network, features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

      <title>A Signer-Invariant Conformer and Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer for Continuous Sign Language Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges, including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work. In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks to be performed through simple prompt-based interactions. Consequently, several approaches have been proposed to engineer prompts that most effectively enable LLMs to perform a given task (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting). In settings with a well-defined metric to optimize model performance, automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods have been developed to refine a seed prompt. Advancing this line of research, we propose APIO, a simple but effective prompt induction and optimization approach for the tasks of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and Text Simplification, without relying on manually specified seed prompts. APIO achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for purely LLM-based prompting methods on these tasks. We make our data, code, prompts, and outputs publicly available.</description>

      <title>What Can We Learn from Inter-Annotator Variability in Skin Lesion Segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA), measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic datasets.

      <title>X-UniMotion: Animating Human Images with Expressive, Unified and Identity-Agnostic Motion Latents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions, body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression, one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses, and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised, end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained, semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dementia Speech Alignment with Diffusion-Based Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image models generate highly realistic images based on natural language descriptions and millions of users use them to create and share images online. While it is expected that such models can align input text and generated image in the same latent space little has been done to understand whether this alignment is possible between pathological speech and generated images. In this work, we examine the ability of such models to align dementia-related speech information with the generated images and develop methods to explain this alignment. Surprisingly, we found that dementia detection is possible from generated images alone achieving 75% accuracy on the ADReSS dataset. We then leverage explainability methods to show which parts of the language contribute to the detection.</description>

      <title>RampNet: A Two-Stage Pipeline for Bootstrapping Curb Ramp Detection in Streetscape Images from Open Government Metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches 0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.</description>

      <title>Domain-Generalization to Improve Learning in Meta-Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Domain Generalization Sharpness-Aware Minimization Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (DGS-MAML), a novel meta-learning algorithm designed to generalize across tasks with limited training data. DGS-MAML combines gradient matching with sharpness-aware minimization in a bi-level optimization framework to enhance model adaptability and robustness. We support our method with theoretical analysis using PAC-Bayes and convergence guarantees. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that DGS-MAML outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and generalization. The proposed method is particularly useful for scenarios requiring few-shot learning and quick adaptation, and the source code is publicly available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks: A Stable Framework for Higher-Order Relational Learning with Provable Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world interactions are group-based rather than pairwise such as papers with multiple co-authors and users jointly engaging with items. Hypergraph neural networks have shown great promise at modeling higher-order relations, but their reliance on a fixed number of explicit message-passing layers limits long-range dependency capture and can destabilize training as depth grows. In this work, we introduce Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks (IHGNN), which bring the implicit equilibrium formulation to hypergraphs: instead of stacking layers, IHGNN computes representations as the solution to a nonlinear fixed-point equation, enabling stable and efficient global propagation across hyperedges without deep architectures. We develop a well-posed training scheme with provable convergence, analyze the oversmoothing conditions and expressivity of the model, and derive a transductive generalization bound on hypergraphs. We further present an implicit-gradient training procedure coupled with a projection-based stabilization strategy. Extensive experiments on citation benchmarks show that IHGNN consistently outperforms strong traditional graph/hypergraph neural network baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Empirically, IHGNN is resilient to random initialization and hyperparameter variation, highlighting its strong generalization and practical value for higher-order relational learning.</description>

      <title>What-Meets-Where: Unified Learning of Action and Contact Localization in a New Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and \textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>Shadow in the Cache: Unveiling and Mitigating Privacy Risks of KV-cache in LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations (Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>A Unified Contrastive-Generative Framework for Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series mainly includes two paradigms: contrastive methods that excel at instance discrimination and generative approaches that model data distributions. While effective individually, their complementary potential remains unexplored. We propose a Contrastive Generative Time series framework (CoGenT), the first framework to unify these paradigms through joint contrastive-generative optimization. CoGenT addresses fundamental limitations of both approaches: it overcomes contrastive learning's sensitivity to high intra-class similarity in temporal data while reducing generative methods' dependence on large datasets. We evaluate CoGenT on six diverse time series datasets. The results show consistent improvements, with up to 59.2% and 14.27% F1 gains over standalone SimCLR and MAE, respectively. Our analysis reveals that the hybrid objective preserves discriminative power while acquiring generative robustness. These findings establish a foundation for hybrid SSL in temporal domains. We will release the code shortly.</description>

      <title>Hallucination vs interpretation: rethinking accuracy and precision in AI-assisted data extraction for knowledge synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09458v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge syntheses (literature reviews) are essential to health professions education (HPE), consolidating findings to advance theory and practice. However, they are labor-intensive, especially during data extraction. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted extraction promises efficiency but raises concerns about accuracy, making it critical to distinguish AI 'hallucinations' (fabricated content) from legitimate interpretive differences. We developed an extraction platform using large language models (LLMs) to automate data extraction and compared AI to human responses across 187 publications and 17 extraction questions from a published scoping review. AI-human, human-human, and AI-AI consistencies were measured using interrater reliability (categorical) and thematic similarity ratings (open-ended). Errors were identified by comparing extracted responses to source publications. AI was highly consistent with humans for concrete, explicitly stated questions (e.g., title, aims) and lower for questions requiring subjective interpretation or absent in text (e.g., Kirkpatrick's outcomes, study rationale). Human-human consistency was not higher than AI-human and showed the same question-dependent variability. Discordant AI-human responses (769/3179 = 24.2%) were mostly due to interpretive differences (18.3%); AI inaccuracies were rare (1.51%), while humans were nearly three times more likely to state inaccuracies (4.37%). Findings suggest AI variability depends more on interpretability than hallucination. Repeating AI extraction can identify interpretive complexity or ambiguity, refining processes before human review. AI can be a transparent, trustworthy partner in knowledge synthesis, though caution is needed to preserve critical human insights.</description>

      <title>RelayFormer: A Unified Local-Global Attention Framework for Scalable Image and Video Manipulation Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual manipulation localization across images and videos. By leveraging flexible local units and a Global-Local Relay Attention (GLoRA) mechanism, it enables scalable, resolution-agnostic processing with strong generalization. Our framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting pretrained representations.
  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports one-shot inference across video sequences with linear complexity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art localization performance, setting a new baseline for scalable and modality-agnostic VML. Code is available at: https://github.com/WenOOI/RelayFormer.</description>

      <title>Gen-AFFECT: Generation of Avatar Fine-grained Facial Expressions with Consistent identiTy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However, existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions. GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.</description>

      <title>DeepFeatIoT: Unifying Deep Learned, Randomized, and LLM Features for Enhanced IoT Time Series Sensor Data Classification in Smart Industries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are ubiquitous technologies deployed across smart cities, industrial sites, and healthcare systems. They continuously generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies, inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model, DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized performance across multiple real-world IoT sensor datasets from diverse critical application domains, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark models. These results highlight DeepFeatIoT's potential to drive significant advancements in IoT analytics and support the development of next-generation smart systems.</description>

      <title>NeuronTune: Fine-Grained Neuron Modulation for Balanced Safety-Utility Alignment in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring robust safety alignment while preserving utility is critical for the reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries, degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds, supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.</description>

      <title>Episodic Memory Representation for Long-form Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently, recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information, diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore, the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs. Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective baselines while utilizing fewer frames.</description>

      <title>Large-Small Model Collaborative Framework for Federated Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for Foundation Models (FMs) is an essential yet underexplored challenge, especially in Federated Continual Learning (FCL), where each client learns from a private, evolving task stream under strict data and communication constraints. Despite their powerful generalization abilities, FMs often exhibit suboptimal performance on local downstream tasks, as they are unable to utilize private local data. Furthermore, enabling FMs to learn new tasks without forgetting prior knowledge is inherently a challenging problem, primarily due to their immense parameter count and high model complexity. In contrast, small models can be trained locally under resource-constrained conditions and benefit from more mature CL techniques. To bridge the gap between small models and FMs, we propose the first collaborative framework in FCL, where lightweight local models act as a dynamic bridge, continually adapting to new tasks while enhancing the utility of the large model. Two novel components are also included: Small Model Continual Fine-tuning is for preventing small models from temporal forgetting; One-by-One Distillation performs personalized fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance, even when clients utilize heterogeneous small models.</description>

      <title>Learning Facts at Scale with Active Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs are known to store vast amounts of knowledge in their parametric memory. However, learning and recalling facts from this memory is known to be unreliable, depending largely on the prevalence of particular facts in the training data and other factors which are poorly understood. Practitioners are lacking tools which will allow them to ensure that the models learn a given body of knowledge reliably and consistently. To this end, we propose Active Reading: a framework where we train models to study a given set of material with self-generated learning strategies. First, we demonstrate models trained with Active Reading on expert domains absorb significantly more knowledge than vanilla finetuning and other data augmentations. We train expert 8B models that achieve 66% on a Wikipedia-grounded subset of SimpleQA (+313% relative over vanilla finetuning) and 26% on FinanceBench (+160% relative over vanilla finetuning) by applying Active Reading to the source documents for each benchmark. Finally, we show that Active Reading can be utilized at pre-training scale to build more factual models. As a demonstration of this, we release Meta WikiExpert-8B, a Wikipedia-expert model trained on 1 trillion generated tokens, which outcompetes models with hundreds of billions of parameters on factual QA.</description>

      <title>From Ranking to Selection: A Simple but Efficient Dynamic Passage Selector for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are often bottlenecked by their reranking modules, which typically score passages independently and select a fixed Top-K size. This approach struggles with complex multi-hop queries that require synthesizing evidence across multiple documents, creating a trade-off where small K values omit crucial information and large K values introduce noise. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Passage Selector (DPS), a novel reranking framework that treats passage selection as a supervised learning problem. Unlike traditional point-wise or list-wise methods, DPS is fine-tuned to capture inter-passage dependencies and dynamically select the most relevant set of passages for generation. As a seamless plug-and-play module, DPS requires no modifications to the standard RAG pipeline. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that DPS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art rerankers and fine-tuning methods. Notably, on the challenging MuSiQue dataset, DPS improves the F1-score by 30.06% and 15.4% over strong baselines like Qwen3-reranker and RankingGPT, respectively. Our results demonstrate that by enabling adaptive evidence selection, DPS substantially enhances reasoning capabilities in complex RAG scenarios.</description>

      <title>Verify Distributed Deep Learning Model Implementation Refinement with Iterative Relation Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed machine learning training and inference is common today because today's large models require more memory and compute than can be provided by a single GPU. Distributed models are generally produced by programmers who take a sequential model specification and apply several distribution strategies to distribute state and computation across GPUs. Unfortunately, bugs can be introduced in the process, and a distributed model implementation's outputs might differ from the sequential model's outputs. In this paper, we describe an approach to statically identify such bugs by checking model refinement, that is, can the sequential model's outputs be reconstructed from the distributed model's outputs? Our approach, implemented in GraphGuard, uses iterative rewriting to prove model refinement. Our approach can scale to today's large models and deployments: we evaluate it using GPT and Llama-3. Further, it provides actionable output that aids in bug localization.</description>

      <title>SMART-OC: A Real-time Time-risk Optimal Replanning Algorithm for Dynamic Obstacles and Spatio-temporally Varying Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical marine environments are highly complex with spatio-temporally varying currents and dynamic obstacles, presenting significant challenges to Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) for safe and efficient navigation. Thus, the USVs need to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents (SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents to successfully reach the goal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotional support conversations are crucial for promoting emotional well-being, yet current models often lack deep empathetic reasoning grounded in psychological principles. To address this, we propose controllable empathetic reasoning, which combines natural language reasoning with structured psychological steps. We construct a fine-grained dataset annotated with reasoning correctness and response preferences to enable this capability. To further enhance training, we employ reinforcement learning with a unified process-outcome reward model that delivers precise feedback. To mitigate response repetitiveness from entropy collapse, we introduce personality-based dialogue rewriting and a redundancy-aware reward reweighting strategy. Our approach significantly improves model's emotional support ability, advancing the development of empathetic, human-like support systems.</description>

      <title>Generation of Indian Sign Language Letters, Numbers, and Words</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network (ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12, respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Rank Scheduling for Energy-Constrained Multi-Task Federated Fine-Tuning in Edge-Assisted IoV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach for adapting foundation models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks in edge environments. In Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, enabling efficient and low-latency multi-task adaptation is particularly challenging due to client mobility, heterogeneous resources, and intermittent connectivity. This paper proposes a hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework that coordinates roadside units (RSUs) and vehicles to support resource-aware and mobility-resilient learning across dynamic IoV scenarios. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce a decentralized, energy-aware rank adaptation mechanism formulated as a constrained multi-armed bandit problem. A novel UCB-DUAL algorithm is developed to enable adaptive exploration under per-task energy budgets, achieving provable sublinear regret. To evaluate our method, we construct a large-scale IoV simulator based on real-world trajectories, capturing dynamic participation, RSU handoffs, and communication variability. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off among all baselines, reducing latency by over 24\% and improving average accuracy by more than 2.5\%.</description>

      <title>COXNet: Cross-Layer Fusion with Adaptive Alignment and Scale Integration for RGBT Tiny Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search and rescue, and autonomous navigation. Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module, correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$ improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.</description>

      <title>AI Blob! LLM-Driven Recontextualization of Italian Television Archives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces AI Blob!, an experimental system designed to explore the potential of semantic cataloging and Large Language Models (LLMs) for the retrieval and recontextualization of archival television footage. Drawing methodological inspiration from Italian television programs such as Blob (RAI Tre, 1989-), AI Blob! integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), semantic embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to organize and reinterpret archival content. The system processes a curated dataset of 1,547 Italian television videos by transcribing audio, segmenting it into sentence-level units, and embedding these segments into a vector database for semantic querying. Upon user input of a thematic prompt, the LLM generates a range of linguistically and conceptually related queries, guiding the retrieval and recombination of audiovisual fragments. These fragments are algorithmically selected and structured into narrative sequences producing montages that emulate editorial practices of ironic juxtaposition and thematic coherence. By foregrounding dynamic, content-aware retrieval over static metadata schemas, AI Blob! demonstrates how semantic technologies can facilitate new approaches to archival engagement, enabling novel forms of automated narrative construction and cultural analysis. The project contributes to ongoing debates in media historiography and AI-driven archival research, offering both a conceptual framework and a publicly available dataset to support further interdisciplinary experimentation.</description>

      <title>Your Coding Intent is Secretly in the Context and You Should Deliberately Infer It Before Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for function completion in repository-scale codebases. Prior studies demonstrate that when explicit instructions--such as docstrings--are provided, these models can generate highly accurate implementations. However, in real-world repositories, such annotations are frequently absent, and performance drops substantially without them. To address this gap, we frame the task as a three-stage process. The first stage focuses on intent inference, where the model analyzes the code preceding the target function to uncover cues about the desired functionality. Such preceding context often encodes subtle but critical information, and we design a reasoning-based prompting framework to guide the LLM through step-by-step extraction and synthesis of these signals before any code is generated. The second stage introduces an optional interactive refinement mechanism to handle cases where preceding context alone is insufficient for intent recovery. In this stage, the model proposes a small set of candidate intentions, enabling the developer to select or edit them so that the inferred intent closely matches the actual requirement. Finally, in the third stage, the LLM generates the target function conditioned on the finalized intent. To support this pipeline, we curate a dataset of 40,000 examples annotated with intermediate reasoning traces and corresponding docstrings. Extensive experiments on DevEval and ComplexCodeEval show that our approach consistently boosts multiple LLMs, achieving over 20\% relative gains in both reference-based and execution-based metrics, with the interactive refinement stage delivering additional improvements beyond these gains.</description>

      <title>GoViG: Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation (GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and (2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies, one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain generalization.</description>

      <title>CaRoBio: 3D Cable Routing with a Bio-inspired Gripper Fingernail</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of deformable linear flexures has a wide range of applications in industry, such as cable routing in automotive manufacturing and textile production. Cable routing, as a complex multi-stage robot manipulation scenario, is a challenging task for robot automation. Common parallel two-finger grippers have the risk of over-squeezing and over-tension when grasping and guiding cables. In this paper, a novel eagle-inspired fingernail is designed and mounted on the gripper fingers, which helps with cable grasping on planar surfaces and in-hand cable guiding operations. Then we present a single-grasp end-to-end 3D cable routing framework utilizing the proposed fingernails, instead of the common pick-and-place strategy. Continuous control is achieved to efficiently manipulate cables through vision-based state estimation of task configurations and offline trajectory planning based on motion primitives. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with a variety of cables and channel slots, significantly outperforming the pick-and-place manipulation process under equivalent perceptual conditions. Our reconfigurable task setting and the proposed framework provide a reference for future cable routing manipulations in 3D space.</description>

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Learned Cardinality Estimation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database management systems, aiming to predict query results accurately without executing the queries. However, existing techniques either achieve low estimation accuracy or incur high inference latency. Simultaneously achieving high speed and accuracy becomes critical for the cardinality estimation problem. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach called CoDe (Covering with Decompositions) to address this problem. CoDe employs the concept of covering design, which divides the table into multiple smaller, overlapping segments. For each segment, CoDe utilizes tensor decomposition to accurately model its data distribution. Moreover, CoDe introduces innovative algorithms to select the best-fitting distributions for each query, combining them to estimate the final result. By employing multiple models to approximate distributions, CoDe excels in effectively modeling discrete distributions and ensuring computational efficiency. Notably, experimental results show that our method represents a significant advancement in cardinality estimation, achieving state-of-the-art levels of both estimation accuracy and inference efficiency. Across various datasets, CoDe achieves absolute accuracy in estimating more than half of the queries.</description>

      <title>How Persuasive Could LLMs Be? A First Study Combining Linguistic-Rhetorical Analysis and User Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the rhetorical and linguistic features of argumentative texts generated by ChatGPT on ethically nuanced topics and investigates their persuasive impact on human readers.Through a user study involving 62 participants and pre-post interaction surveys, the paper analyzes how exposure to AI-generated arguments affects opinion change and user perception. A linguistic and rhetorical analysis of the generated texts reveals a consistent argumentative macrostructure, reliance on formulaic expressions, and limited stylistic richness. While ChatGPT demonstrates proficiency in constructing coherent argumentative texts, its persuasive efficacy appears constrained, particularly on topics involving ethical issues.The study finds that while participants often acknowledge the benefits highlighted by ChatGPT, ethical concerns tend to persist or even intensify post-interaction. The results also demonstrate a variation depending on the topic. These findings highlight new insights on AI-generated persuasion in ethically sensitive domains and are a basis for future research.</description>

      <title>MInDI-3D: Iterative Deep Learning in 3D for Sparse-view Cone Beam Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first 3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full 3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics, scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11 clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10) dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Robot Control via Structured Behavior Trees and Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As intelligent robots become more integrated into human environments, there is a growing need for intuitive and reliable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) interfaces that are adaptable and more natural to interact with. Traditional robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots. The complete source code of the framework is publicly available at https://github.com/snt-arg/robot_suite.</description>

      <title>Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal inference is crucial for humans to explore the world, which can be modeled to enable an agent to efficiently explore the environment in reinforcement learning. Existing research indicates that establishing the causality between action and state transition will enhance an agent to reason how a policy affects its future trajectory, thereby promoting directed exploration. However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its intractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework for efficient environment exploration. Specifically, we first derive a measurement of causality in state space, \emph{i.e.,} causal capacity, which represents the highest influence of an agent's behavior on future trajectories. After that, we present a Monte Carlo based method to identify critical points in discrete state space and further optimize this method for continuous high-dimensional environments. Those critical points are used to uncover where the agent makes important decisions in the environment, which are then regarded as our subgoals to guide the agent to make exploration more purposefully and efficiently. Empirical results from multi-objective tasks demonstrate that states with high causal capacity align with our expected subgoals, and our GDCC achieves significant success rate improvements compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>TimeMKG: Knowledge-Infused Causal Reasoning for Multivariate Time Series Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities: variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However, these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive performance and generalization.</description>

      <title>AmbiGraph-Eval: Can LLMs Effectively Handle Ambiguous Graph Queries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in translating natural language into database queries, especially when dealing with complex graph-structured data. However, real-world queries often contain inherent ambiguities, and the interconnected nature of graph structures can amplify these challenges, leading to unintended or incorrect query results. To systematically evaluate LLMs on this front, we propose a taxonomy of graph-query ambiguities, comprising three primary types: Attribute Ambiguity, Relationship Ambiguity, and Attribute-Relationship Ambiguity, each subdivided into Same-Entity and Cross-Entity scenarios. We introduce AmbiGraph-Eval, a novel benchmark of real-world ambiguous queries paired with expert-verified graph query answers. Evaluating 9 representative LLMs shows that even top models struggle with ambiguous graph queries. Our findings reveal a critical gap in ambiguity handling and motivate future work on specialized resolution techniques.</description>

      <title>Preacher: Paper-to-Video Agentic System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09632v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible, well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a topdown approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models.

Abstract: The paper explores the study of gender-based narrative biases in stories generated by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. The prompt design draws on Propp's character classifications and Freytag's narrative structure. The stories are analyzed through a close reading approach, with particular attention to adherence to the prompt, gender distribution of characters, physical and psychological descriptions, actions, and finally, plot development and character relationships. The results reveal the persistence of biases - especially implicit ones - in the generated stories and highlight the importance of assessing biases at multiple levels using an interpretative approach.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the Role of Rule-based Detection in AI Systems for Windows Malware Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malware detection increasingly relies on AI systems that integrate signature-based detection with machine learning. However, these components are typically developed and combined in isolation, missing opportunities to reduce data complexity and strengthen defenses against adversarial EXEmples, carefully crafted programs designed to evade detection. Hence, in this work we investigate the influence that signature-based detection exerts on model training, when they are included inside the training pipeline. Specifically, we compare models trained on a comprehensive dataset with an AI system whose machine learning component is trained solely on samples not already flagged by signatures. Our results demonstrate improved robustness to both adversarial EXEmples and temporal data drift, although this comes at the cost of a fixed lower bound on false positives, driven by suboptimal rule selection. We conclude by discussing these limitations and outlining how future research could extend AI-based malware detection to include dynamic analysis, thereby further enhancing system resilience.</description>

      <title>On Negative-aware Preference Optimization for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems leverage user interaction data to suggest relevant items while filtering out irrelevant (negative) ones. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention for their potential in recommendation tasks. However, existing methods for optimizing LLM-based recommenders face challenges in effectively utilizing negative samples. Simply integrating large numbers of negative samples can improve ranking accuracy and mitigate popularity bias but often leads to increased computational overhead and memory costs. Additionally, current approaches fail to account for the varying informativeness of negative samples, leading to suboptimal optimization performance. To address these issues, we propose NAPO (\textbf{N}egative-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization), an enhanced framework for preference optimization in LLM-based recommendation. NAPO introduces two key innovations: (1) in-batch negative sharing, which expands the pool of negative samples without additional memory overhead, and (2) dynamic reward margin adjustment, which adapts model updates based on the confidence of negative samples. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that NAPO outperforms existing methods in both recommendation accuracy and popularity bias reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) application providers rely on Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and roaming infrastructures to deliver their services globally. In this complex ecosystem, where the end-to-end communication path traverses multiple entities, it has become increasingly challenging to guarantee communication availability and reliability. Further, most platform operators use a reactive approach to communication issues, responding to user complaints only after incidents have become severe, compromising service quality. This paper presents our experience in the design and deployment of ANCHOR -- an unsupervised anomaly detection solution for the IoT connectivity service of a large global roaming platform. ANCHOR assists engineers by filtering vast amounts of data to identify potential problematic clients (i.e., those with connectivity issues affecting several of their IoT devices), enabling proactive issue resolution before the service is critically impacted. We first describe the IoT service, infrastructure, and network visibility of the IoT connectivity provider we operate. Second, we describe the main challenges and operational requirements for designing an unsupervised anomaly detection solution on this platform. Following these guidelines, we propose different statistical rules, and machine- and deep-learning models for IoT verticals anomaly detection based on passive signaling traffic. We describe the steps we followed working with the operational teams on the design and evaluation of our solution on the operational platform, and report an evaluation on operational IoT customers.</description>

      <title>Surg-InvNeRF: Invertible NeRF for 3D tracking and reconstruction in surgical vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field (InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable NeRF-based reconstruction.</description>

In this paper, I empirically evaluate how well LLMs, such as GPT, Claude, and Llama, perform key legal tasks in the Indian context, including issue spotting, legal drafting, advice, research, and reasoning. Through a survey experiment, I compare outputs from LLMs with those of a junior lawyer, with advanced law students rating the work on helpfulness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness. LLMs excel in drafting and issue spotting, often matching or surpassing human work. However, they struggle with specialised legal research, frequently generating hallucinations, factually incorrect or fabricated outputs. I conclude that while LLMs can augment certain legal tasks, human expertise remains essential for nuanced reasoning and the precise application of law.</description>

      <title>Improving ARDS Diagnosis Through Context-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large, publicly available clinical datasets have emerged as a novel resource for understanding disease heterogeneity and to explore personalization of therapy. These datasets are derived from data not originally collected for research purposes and, as a result, are often incomplete and lack critical labels. Many AI tools have been developed to retrospectively label these datasets, such as by performing disease classification; however, they often suffer from limited interpretability. Previous work has attempted to explain predictions using Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which learn interpretable concepts that map to higher-level clinical ideas, facilitating human evaluation. However, these models often experience performance limitations when the concepts fail to adequately explain or characterize the task. We use the identification of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as a challenging test case to demonstrate the value of incorporating contextual information from clinical notes to improve CBM performance. Our approach leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to process clinical notes and generate additional concepts, resulting in a 10% performance gain over existing methods. Additionally, it facilitates the learning of more comprehensive concepts, thereby reducing the risk of information leakage and reliance on spurious shortcuts, thus improving the characterization of ARDS.</description>

      <title>Region-to-Region: Enhancing Generative Image Harmonization with Adaptive Regional Injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely, generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements. To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding individual cortical development is essential for identifying deviations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. However, current normative modelling frameworks struggle to capture fine-scale anatomical details due to their reliance on modelling data within a population-average reference space. Here, we present a novel framework for learning individual growth trajectories from biomechanically constrained, longitudinal, diffeomorphic image registration, implemented via a hierarchical network architecture. Trained on neonatal MRI data from the Developing Human Connectome Project, the method improves the biological plausibility of warps, generating growth trajectories that better follow population-level trends while generating smoother warps, with fewer negative Jacobians, relative to state-of-the-art baselines. The resulting subject-specific deformations provide interpretable, biologically grounded mappings of development. This framework opens new possibilities for predictive modeling of brain maturation and early identification of malformations of cortical development.</description>

      <title>Enhance the machine learning algorithm performance in phishing detection with keyword features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we can observe a significant increase of the phishing attacks in the Internet. In a typical phishing attack, the attacker sets up a malicious website that looks similar to the legitimate website in order to obtain the end-users' information. This may cause the leakage of the sensitive information and the financial loss for the end-users. To avoid such attacks, the early detection of these websites' URLs is vital and necessary. Previous researchers have proposed many machine learning algorithms to distinguish the phishing URLs from the legitimate ones. In this paper, we would like to enhance these machine learning algorithms from the perspective of feature selection. We propose a novel method to incorporate the keyword features with the traditional features. This method is applied on multiple traditional machine learning algorithms and the experimental results have shown this method is useful and effective. On average, this method can reduce the classification error by 30% for the large dataset. Moreover, its enhancement is more significant for the small dataset. In addition, this method extracts the information from the URL and does not rely on the additional information provided by the third-part service. The best result for the machine learning algorithm using our proposed method has achieved the accuracy of 99.68%.</description>

      <title>Counting Short Trajectories in Elementary Cellular Automata using the Transfer Matrix Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) exhibit diverse behaviours often categorized by Wolfram's qualitative classification. To provide a quantitative basis for understanding these behaviours, we investigate the global dynamics of such automata and we describe a method that allows us to compute the number of all configurations leading to short attractors in a limited number of time steps. This computation yields exact results in the thermodynamic limit (as the CA grid size grows to infinity), and is based on the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) that we adapt for our purposes. Specifically, given two parameters $(p, c)$ we are able to compute the entropy of all initial configurations converging to an attractor of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps. By calculating such statistics for various ECA rules, we establish a quantitative connection between the entropy and the qualitative Wolfram classification scheme. Class 1 rules rapidly converge to maximal entropy for stationary states ($c=1$) as $p$ increases. Class 2 rules also approach maximal entropy quickly for appropriate cycle lengths $c$, potentially requiring consideration of translations. Class 3 rules exhibit zero or low finite entropy that saturates after a short transient. Class 4 rules show finite positive entropy, similar to some Class 3 rules. This method provides a precise framework for quantifying trajectory statistics, although its exponential computational cost in $p+c$ restricts practical analysis to short trajectories.</description>

      <title>Can LLM-Generated Textual Explanations Enhance Model Classification Performance? An Empirical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Explainable Natural Language Processing (NLP), textual explanations, i.e., human-like rationales, are pivotal for explaining model predictions and enriching datasets with interpretable labels. Traditional approaches rely on human annotation, which is costly, labor-intensive, and impedes scalability. In this work, we present an automated framework that leverages multiple state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality textual explanations. We rigorously assess the quality of these LLM-generated explanations using a comprehensive suite of Natural Language Generation (NLG) metrics. Furthermore, we investigate the downstream impact of these explanations on the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and LLMs across natural language inference tasks on two diverse benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that automated explanations exhibit highly competitive effectiveness compared to human-annotated explanations in improving model performance. Our findings underscore a promising avenue for scalable, automated LLM-based textual explanation generation for extending NLP datasets and enhancing model performance.</description>

      <title>Combinative Matching for Geometric Shape Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching, to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration. In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method, consistently outperforming the state of the art.

      <title>Adoption of Explainable Natural Language Processing: Perspectives from Industry and Academia on Practices and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of explainable natural language processing (NLP) has grown rapidly in recent years. The growing opacity of complex models calls for transparency and explanations of their decisions, which is crucial to understand their reasoning and facilitate deployment, especially in high-stakes environments. Despite increasing attention given to explainable NLP, practitioners' perspectives regarding its practical adoption and effectiveness remain underexplored. This paper addresses this research gap by investigating practitioners' experiences with explainability methods, specifically focusing on their motivations for adopting such methods, the techniques employed, satisfaction levels, and the practical challenges encountered in real-world NLP applications. Through a qualitative interview-based study with industry practitioners and complementary interviews with academic researchers, we systematically analyze and compare their perspectives. Our findings reveal conceptual gaps, low satisfaction with current explainability methods, and highlight evaluation challenges. Our findings emphasize the need for clear definitions and user-centric frameworks for better adoption of explainable NLP in practice.</description>

      <title>Prototype Training with Dual Pseudo-Inverse and Optimized Hidden Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Proto-PINV+H, a fast training paradigm that combines closed-form weight computation with gradient-based optimisation of a small set of synthetic inputs, soft labels, and-crucially-hidden activations. At each iteration we recompute all weight matrices in closed form via two (or more) ridge-regularised pseudo-inverse solves, while updating only the prototypes with Adam. The trainable degrees of freedom are thus shifted from weight space to data/activation space. On MNIST (60k train, 10k test) and Fashion-MNIST (60k train, 10k test), our method reaches 97.8% and 89.3% test accuracy on the official 10k test sets, respectively, in 3.9s--4.5s using approximately 130k trainable parameters and only 250 epochs on an RTX 5060 (16GB). We provide a multi-layer extension (optimised activations at each hidden stage), learnable ridge parameters, optional PCA/PLS projections, and theory linking the condition number of prototype matrices to generalisation. The approach yields favourable accuracy--speed--size trade-offs against ELM, random-feature ridge, and shallow MLPs trained by back-propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose LibRec, a novel framework that integrates the capabilities of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) techniques to automate the recommendation of alternative libraries. The framework further employs in-context learning to extract migration intents from commit messages to enhance the accuracy of its recommendations. To evaluate the effectiveness of LibRec, we introduce LibEval, a benchmark designed to assess the performance in the library migration recommendation task. LibEval comprises 2,888 migration records associated with 2,368 libraries extracted from 2,324 Python repositories. Each migration record captures source-target library pairs, along with their corresponding migration intents and intent types. Based on LibEval, we evaluated the effectiveness of ten popular LLMs within our framework, conducted an ablation study to examine the contributions of key components within our framework, explored the impact of various prompt strategies on the framework's performance, assessed its effectiveness across various intent types, and performed detailed failure case analyses.</description>

      <title>Explainable Ensemble Learning for Graph-Based Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malware detection in modern computing environments demands models that are not only accurate but also interpretable and robust to evasive techniques. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this domain by modeling rich structural dependencies in graph-based program representations such as control flow graphs (CFGs). However, single-model approaches may suffer from limited generalization and lack interpretability, especially in high-stakes security applications. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble framework for graph-based malware detection and explanation. Our method dynamically extracts CFGs from portable executable (PE) files and encodes their basic blocks through a two-step embedding strategy. A set of diverse GNN base learners, each with a distinct message-passing mechanism, is used to capture complementary behavioral features. Their prediction outputs are aggregated by a meta-learner implemented as an attention-based multilayer perceptron, which both classifies malware instances and quantifies the contribution of each base model. To enhance explainability, we introduce an ensemble-aware post-hoc explanation technique that leverages edge-level importance scores generated by a GNN explainer and fuses them using the learned attention weights. This produces interpretable, model-agnostic explanations aligned with the final ensemble decision. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves classification performance while providing insightful interpretations of malware behavior.</description>

      <title>Automated Segmentation of Coronal Brain Tissue Slabs for 3D Neuropathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of \textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue, from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and \textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\% Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels. Our tool is publicly available at surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PhotoTools.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Datasets for Clinical Mental Health AI Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental health disorders are rising worldwide. However, the availability of trained clinicians has not scaled proportionally, leaving many people without adequate or timely support. To bridge this gap, recent studies have shown the promise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist mental health diagnosis, monitoring, and intervention. However, the development of efficient, reliable, and ethical AI to assist clinicians is heavily dependent on high-quality clinical training datasets. Despite growing interest in data curation for training clinical AI assistants, existing datasets largely remain scattered, under-documented, and often inaccessible, hindering the reproducibility, comparability, and generalizability of AI models developed for clinical mental health care. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey of clinical mental health datasets relevant to the training and development of AI-powered clinical assistants. We categorize these datasets by mental disorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia), data modalities (e.g., text, speech, physiological signals), task types (e.g., diagnosis prediction, symptom severity estimation, intervention generation), accessibility (public, restricted or private), and sociocultural context (e.g., language and cultural background). Along with these, we also investigate synthetic clinical mental health datasets. Our survey identifies critical gaps such as a lack of longitudinal data, limited cultural and linguistic representation, inconsistent collection and annotation standards, and a lack of modalities in synthetic data. We conclude by outlining key challenges in curating and standardizing future datasets and provide actionable recommendations to facilitate the development of more robust, generalizable, and equitable mental health AI systems.</description>

By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the learned physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Provable In-Context Vector Arithmetic via Retrieving Task Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has garnered significant attention for its ability to grasp functions/tasks from demonstrations. Recent studies suggest the presence of a latent task/function vector in LLMs during ICL. Merullo et al. (2024) showed that LLMs leverage this vector alongside the residual stream for Word2Vec-like vector arithmetic, solving factual-recall ICL tasks. Additionally, recent work empirically highlighted the key role of Question-Answer data in enhancing factual-recall capabilities. Despite these insights, a theoretical explanation remains elusive. To move one step forward, we propose a theoretical framework building on empirically grounded hierarchical concept modeling. We develop an optimization theory, showing how nonlinear residual transformers trained via gradient descent on cross-entropy loss perform factual-recall ICL tasks via vector arithmetic. We prove 0-1 loss convergence and show the strong generalization, including robustness to concept recombination and distribution shifts. These results elucidate the advantages of transformers over static embedding predecessors. Empirical simulations corroborate our theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>RayletDF: Raylet Distance Fields for Generalizable 3D Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds or Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward pass across unseen datasets in testing.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models in Fine-Grained Review Comment Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code review is a crucial practice in software development. As code review nowadays is lightweight, various issues can be identified, and sometimes, they can be trivial. Research has investigated automated approaches to classify review comments to gauge the effectiveness of code reviews. However, previous studies have primarily relied on supervised machine learning, which requires extensive manual annotation to train the models effectively. To address this limitation, we explore the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify code review comments. We assess the performance of LLMs to classify 17 categories of code review comments. Our results show that LLMs can classify code review comments, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach using a trained deep learning model. In particular, LLMs achieve better accuracy in classifying the five most useful categories, which the state-of-the-art approach struggles with due to low training examples. Rather than relying solely on a specific small training data distribution, our results show that LLMs provide balanced performance across high- and low-frequency categories. These results suggest that the LLMs could offer a scalable solution for code review analytics to improve the effectiveness of the code review process.</description>

      <title>Speed Always Wins: A Survey on Efficient Architectures for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have delivered impressive results in language understanding, generation, reasoning, and pushes the ability boundary of multimodal models. Transformer models, as the foundation of modern LLMs, offer a strong baseline with excellent scaling properties. However, the traditional transformer architecture requires substantial computations and poses significant obstacles for large-scale training and practical deployment. In this survey, we offer a systematic examination of innovative LLM architectures that address the inherent limitations of transformers and boost the efficiency. Starting from language modeling, this survey covers the background and technical details of linear and sparse sequence modeling methods, efficient full attention variants, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid model architectures incorporating the above techniques, and emerging diffusion LLMs. Additionally, we discuss applications of these techniques to other modalities and consider their wider implications for developing scalable, resource-aware foundation models. By grouping recent studies into the above category, this survey presents a blueprint of modern efficient LLM architectures, and we hope this could help motivate future research toward more efficient, versatile AI systems.</description>

      <title>PRELUDE: A Benchmark Designed to Require Global Comprehension and Reasoning over Long Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09848v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce PRELUDE, a benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding through the task of determining whether a character's prequel story is consistent with the canonical narrative of the original book. Our task poses a stronger demand for global comprehension and deep reasoning than existing benchmarks -- as the prequels are not part of the original story, assessing their plausibility typically requires searching and integrating information that is only indirectly related. Empirically, 88% of instances require evidence from multiple parts of the narrative. Experimental results highlight the challenge of our task: in-context learning, RAG and in-domain training with state-of-the-art LLMs, and commercial DeepResearch services, lag behind humans by &gt;15%. A further human study reveals that models often produce correct answers with flawed reasoning, leading to an over 30% gap in reasoning accuracy compared to humans. These findings underscore the substantial room for improvement in long-context understanding and reasoning.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Reality Transformer: Neural Architectures for Simulating Neurological Perception Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurological conditions affecting visual perception create profound experiential divides between affected individuals and their caregivers, families, and medical professionals. We present the Perceptual Reality Transformer, a comprehensive framework employing six distinct neural architectures to simulate eight neurological perception conditions with scientifically-grounded visual transformations. Our system learns mappings from natural images to condition-specific perceptual states, enabling others to experience approximations of simultanagnosia, prosopagnosia, ADHD attention deficits, visual agnosia, depression-related changes, anxiety tunnel vision, and Alzheimer's memory effects. Through systematic evaluation across ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures achieve optimal performance, outperforming traditional CNN and generative approaches. Our work establishes the first systematic benchmark for neurological perception simulation, contributes novel condition-specific perturbation functions grounded in clinical literature, and provides quantitative metrics for evaluating simulation fidelity. The framework has immediate applications in medical education, empathy training, and assistive technology development, while advancing our fundamental understanding of how neural networks can model atypical human perception.</description>

      <title>STREAM (ChemBio): A Standard for Transparently Reporting Evaluations in AI Model Reports</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluations of dangerous AI capabilities are important for managing catastrophic risks. Public transparency into these evaluations - including what they test, how they are conducted, and how their results inform decisions - is crucial for building trust in AI development. We propose STREAM (A Standard for Transparently Reporting Evaluations in AI Model Reports), a standard to improve how model reports disclose evaluation results, initially focusing on chemical and biological (ChemBio) benchmarks. Developed in consultation with 23 experts across government, civil society, academia, and frontier AI companies, this standard is designed to (1) be a practical resource to help AI developers present evaluation results more clearly, and (2) help third parties identify whether model reports provide sufficient detail to assess the rigor of the ChemBio evaluations. We concretely demonstrate our proposed best practices with "gold standard" examples, and also provide a three-page reporting template to enable AI developers to implement our recommendations more easily.</description>

      <title>Memory Decoder: A Pretrained, Plug-and-Play Memory for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in general language tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains a challenge. Current method like Domain Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT) requires costly full-parameter training and suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces substantial inference latency due to expensive nearest-neighbor searches and longer context. This paper introduces Memory Decoder, a plug-and-play pretrained memory that enables efficient domain adaptation without changing the original model's parameters. Memory Decoder employs a small transformer decoder that learns to imitate the behavior of an external non-parametric retriever. Once trained, Memory Decoder can be seamlessly integrated with any pretrained language model that shares the same tokenizer, requiring no model-specific modifications. Experimental results demonstrate that Memory Decoder enables effective adaptation of various Qwen and Llama models to three distinct specialized domains: biomedicine, finance, and law, reducing perplexity by an average of 6.17 points. Overall, Memory Decoder introduces a novel paradigm centered on a specially pretrained memory component designed for domain-specific adaptation. This memory architecture can be integrated in a plug-and-play manner, consistently enhancing performance across multiple models within the target domain.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scaling Law: A Data-Efficient Distillation Framework for Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities in tasks such as algorithmic coding and mathematical problem-solving. Recent methods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some methods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via only distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing computational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation framework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation. Inspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of reinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We identify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher model. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop a method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can enhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully curated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the student model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method through evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and code generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only 0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling. Our systematic analysis demonstrates that DED outperforms existing methods by considering factors beyond superficial hardness, token length, or teacher model capability. This work offers a practical and efficient pathway to advanced reasoning while preserving general capabilities.</description>

      <title>COME: Dual Structure-Semantic Learning with Collaborative MoE for Universal Lesion Detection Across Heterogeneous Ultrasound Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions, especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises: how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME). Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that create a universal representation space and then collaborate with source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Rare anomalies require large datasets: About proving the existence of anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting whether any anomalies exist within a dataset is crucial for effective anomaly detection, yet it remains surprisingly underexplored in anomaly detection literature. This paper presents a comprehensive study that addresses the fundamental question: When can we conclusively determine that anomalies are present? Through extensive experimentation involving over three million statistical tests across various anomaly detection tasks and algorithms, we identify a relationship between the dataset size, contamination rate, and an algorithm-dependent constant $ \alpha_{\text{algo}} $. Our results demonstrate that, for an unlabeled dataset of size $ N $ and contamination rate $ \nu $, the condition $ N \ge \frac{\alpha_{\text{algo}}}{\nu^2} $ represents a lower bound on the number of samples required to confirm anomaly existence. This threshold implies a limit to how rare anomalies can be before proving their existence becomes infeasible.</description>

      <title>Beyond Na\"ive Prompting: Strategies for Improved Zero-shot Context-aided Forecasting with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting in real-world settings requires models to integrate not only historical data but also relevant contextual information, often available in textual form. While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be effective context-aided forecasters via na\"ive direct prompting, their full potential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies, providing new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting. ReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing us to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its forecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts with context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting pipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided forecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the largest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to estimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger models. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from the CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\"ive prompting across LLMs of different sizes and families. These results open the door to further simple yet effective improvements in LLM-based context-aided forecasting.</description>

      <title>T-CACE: A Time-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement Multi-Task Framework for Contrast-Free Liver MRI Synthesis, Segmentation, and Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a leading modality for the diagnosis of liver cancer, significantly improving the classification of the lesion and patient outcomes. However, traditional MRI faces challenges including risks from contrast agent (CA) administration, time-consuming manual assessment, and limited annotated datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a Time-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement (T-CACE) framework for synthesizing multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI) directly from non-contrast MRI (NCMRI). T-CACE introduces three core innovations: a conditional token encoding (CTE) mechanism that unifies anatomical priors and temporal phase information into latent representations; and a dynamic time-aware attention mask (DTAM) that adaptively modulates inter-phase information flow using a Gaussian-decayed attention mechanism, ensuring smooth and physiologically plausible transitions across phases. Furthermore, a constraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion classification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further enhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent liver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification. This framework offers a clinically relevant and efficient alternative to traditional contrast-enhanced imaging, improving safety, diagnostic efficiency, and reliability for the assessment of liver lesion. The implementation of T-CACE is publicly available at: https://github.com/xiaojiao929/T-CACE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm, called Residual Reservoir Memory Networks (ResRMNs). ResRMN combines a linear memory reservoir with a non-linear reservoir, where the latter is based on residual orthogonal connections along the temporal dimension for enhanced long-term propagation of the input. The resulting reservoir state dynamics are studied through the lens of linear stability analysis, and we investigate diverse configurations for the temporal residual connections. The proposed approach is empirically assessed on time-series and pixel-level 1-D classification tasks. Our experimental results highlight the advantages of the proposed approach over other conventional RC models.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Evaluation framework of Alignment Techniques for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, ensuring their outputs align with human values and safety standards has become critical. The field has developed diverse alignment approaches including traditional fine-tuning methods (RLHF, instruction tuning), post-hoc correction systems, and inference-time interventions, each with distinct advantages and limitations. However, the lack of unified evaluation frameworks makes it difficult to systematically compare these paradigms and guide deployment decisions. This paper introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation of alignment techniques for LLMs, a comprehensive evaluation framework that provides a systematic comparison across all major alignment paradigms. Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions: alignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and robustness. Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment strategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying strengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing valuable insights for future research directions.</description>

      <title>VisCodex: Unified Multimodal Code Generation via Merging Vision and Coding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced the integration of visual and textual understanding. However, their ability to generate code from multimodal inputs remains limited. In this work, we introduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and coding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation abilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate a state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while preserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support training and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a large-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML code, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic problems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging benchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world programming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and visual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary models like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging strategy and new datasets.</description>

      <title>Specialised or Generic? Tokenization Choices for Radiology Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vocabulary used by language models (LM) - defined by the tokenizer - plays a key role in text generation quality. However, its impact remains under-explored in radiology. In this work, we address this gap by systematically comparing general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers on the task of radiology report summarisation across three imaging modalities. We also investigate scenarios with and without LM pre-training on PubMed abstracts. Our findings demonstrate that medical and domain-specific vocabularies outperformed widely used natural language alternatives when models are trained from scratch. Pre-training partially mitigates performance differences between tokenizers, whilst the domain-specific tokenizers achieve the most favourable results. Domain-specific tokenizers also reduce memory requirements due to smaller vocabularies and shorter sequences. These results demonstrate that adapting the vocabulary of LMs to the clinical domain provides practical benefits, including improved performance and reduced computational demands, making such models more accessible and effective for both research and real-world healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>GBC: Generalized Behavior-Cloning Framework for Whole-Body Humanoid Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The creation of human-like humanoid robots is hindered by a fundamental fragmentation: data processing and learning algorithms are rarely universal across different robot morphologies. This paper introduces the Generalized Behavior Cloning (GBC) framework, a comprehensive and unified solution designed to solve this end-to-end challenge. GBC establishes a complete pathway from human motion to robot action through three synergistic innovations. First, an adaptive data pipeline leverages a differentiable IK network to automatically retarget any human MoCap data to any humanoid. Building on this foundation, our novel DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with its MMTransformer architecture learns robust, high-fidelity imitation policies. To complete the ecosystem, the entire framework is delivered as an efficient, open-source platform based on Isaac Lab, empowering the community to deploy the full workflow via simple configuration scripts. We validate the power and generality of GBC by training policies on multiple heterogeneous humanoids, demonstrating excellent performance and transfer to novel motions. This work establishes the first practical and unified pathway for creating truly generalized humanoid controllers.</description>

      <title>January Food Benchmark (JFB): A Public Benchmark Dataset and Evaluation Suite for Multimodal Food Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress in AI for automated nutritional analysis is critically hampered by the lack of standardized evaluation methodologies and high-quality, real-world benchmark datasets. To address this, we introduce three primary contributions. First, we present the January Food Benchmark (JFB), a publicly available collection of 1,000 food images with human-validated annotations. Second, we detail a comprehensive benchmarking framework, including robust metrics and a novel, application-oriented overall score designed to assess model performance holistically. Third, we provide baseline results from both general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and our own specialized model, january/food-vision-v1. Our evaluation demonstrates that the specialized model achieves an Overall Score of 86.2, a 12.1-point improvement over the best-performing general-purpose configuration. This work offers the research community a valuable new evaluation dataset and a rigorous framework to guide and benchmark future developments in automated nutritional analysis.</description>

      <title>Vision-driven River Following of UAV via Safe Reinforcement Learning using Semantic Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-driven autonomous river following by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is critical for applications such as rescue, surveillance, and environmental monitoring, particularly in dense riverine environments where GPS signals are unreliable. We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which the reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique river segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov Decision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which refines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline computed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage estimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in non-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on patchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and data-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent vision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics Estimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM for cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of solving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes. Simulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and superior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized Advantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions that enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall, CADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the Lagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during training, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard action overlay.</description>

      <title>Echo-4o: Harnessing the Power of GPT-4o Synthetic Images for Improved Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind. Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data? In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries. Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o. In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.</description>

      <title>Multi-Step Reasoning with Large Language Models, a Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models with billions of parameters exhibit in-context learning abilities, enabling few-shot learning on tasks that the model was not specifically trained for. Traditional models achieve breakthrough performance on language tasks, but do not perform well on basic reasoning benchmarks. However, a new in-context learning approach, Chain-of-thought, has demonstrated strong multi-step reasoning abilities on these benchmarks.
  The research on LLM reasoning abilities started with the question whether LLMs can solve grade school math word problems, and has expanded to other tasks in the past few years. This paper reviews the field of multi-step reasoning with LLMs. We propose a taxonomy that identifies different ways to generate, evaluate, and control multi-step reasoning. We provide an in-depth coverage of core approaches and open problems, and we propose a research agenda for the near future.
  We find that multi-step reasoning approaches have progressed beyond math word problems, and can now successfully solve challenges in logic, combinatorial games, and robotics, sometimes by first generating code that is then executed by external tools. Many studies in multi-step methods are using reinforcement learning for finetuning, external optimization loops, in context reinforcement learning, and self-reflection.</description>

Abstract: Mechanical reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, defined by its ubiquitous yet irreplaceable role in human activities ranging from routine tasks to civil engineering. Embedding machines with mechanical reasoning is therefore an important step towards building human-level artificial intelligence. Here, we leveraged 155 cognitive experiments to test the understanding of system stability, gears and pulley systems, leverage principle, inertia and motion, and fluid mechanics in 26 Vision Language Models (VLMs). Results indicate that VLMs consistently perform worse than humans on all domains, while demonstrate significant difficulty in reasoning about gear systems and fluid mechanics. Notably, their performance on these tasks do not improve as number of parameters increase, suggesting that current attention-based architecture may fail to grasp certain underlying mechanisms required for mechanical reasoning, particularly those pertaining to mental simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07866v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their broad applicability, transformer-based models still fall short in System~2 reasoning, lacking the generality and adaptivity needed for human--AI alignment. We examine weaknesses on ARC-AGI tasks, revealing gaps in compositional generalization and novel-rule adaptation, and argue that closing these gaps requires overhauling the reasoning pipeline and its evaluation. We propose three research axes: (1) Symbolic representation pipeline for compositional generality, (2) Interactive feedback-driven reasoning loop for adaptivity, and (3) Test-time task augmentation balancing both qualities. Finally, we demonstrate how ARC-AGI's evaluation suite can be adapted to track progress in symbolic generality, feedback-driven adaptivity, and task-level robustness, thereby guiding future work on robust human--AI alignment.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Your Memory: Reconstruction of Affect-Contextualized Memory via EEG-guided Audiovisual Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RevisitAffectiveMemory, a novel task designed to reconstruct autobiographical memories through audio-visual generation guided by affect extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. To support this pioneering task, we present the EEG-AffectiveMemory dataset, which encompasses textual descriptions, visuals, music, and EEG recordings collected during memory recall from nine participants. Furthermore, we propose RYM (Revisit Your Memory), a three-stage framework for generating synchronized audio-visual contents while maintaining dynamic personal memory affect trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate our method successfully decodes individual affect dynamics trajectories from neural signals during memory recall (F1=0.9). Also, our approach faithfully reconstructs affect-contextualized audio-visual memory across all subjects, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with participants reporting strong affective concordance between their recalled memories and the generated content. Especially, contents generated from subject-reported affect dynamics showed higher correlation with participants' reported affect dynamics trajectories (r=0.265, p&lt;.05) and received stronger user preference (preference=56%) compared to those generated from randomly reordered affect dynamics. Our approaches advance affect decoding research and its practical applications in personalized media creation via neural-based affect comprehension. Codes and the dataset are available at https://github.com/ioahKwon/Revisiting-Your-Memory.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Finetuning Representation Shift for Multimodal LLMs Steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have reached remarkable levels of proficiency in understanding multimodal inputs. However, understanding and interpreting the behavior of such complex models is a challenging task, not to mention the dynamic shifts that may occur during fine-tuning, or due to covariate shift between datasets. In this work, we apply concept-level analysis towards MLLM understanding. More specifically, we propose to map hidden states to interpretable visual and textual concepts. This enables us to more efficiently compare certain semantic dynamics, such as the shift from an original and fine-tuned model, revealing concept alteration and potential biases that may occur during fine-tuning. We also demonstrate the use of shift vectors to capture these concepts changes. These shift vectors allow us to recover fine-tuned concepts by applying simple, computationally inexpensive additive concept shifts in the original model. Finally, our findings also have direct applications for MLLM steering, which can be used for model debiasing as well as enforcing safety in MLLM output. All in all, we propose a novel, training-free, ready-to-use framework for MLLM behavior interpretability and control. Our implementation is publicly available.</description>

      <title>MedRep: Medical Concept Representation for General Electronic Health Record Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) foundation models have been an area ripe for exploration with their improved performance in various medical tasks. Despite the rapid advances, there exists a fundamental limitation: Processing unseen medical codes out of vocabulary. This problem limits the generalizability of EHR foundation models and the integration of models trained with different vocabularies. To alleviate this problem, we propose a set of novel medical concept representations (MedRep) for EHR foundation models based on the observational medical outcome partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). For concept representation learning, we enrich the information of each concept with a minimal definition through large language model (LLM) prompts and complement the text-based representations through the graph ontology of OMOP vocabulary. Our approach outperforms the vanilla EHR foundation model and the model with a previously introduced medical code tokenizer in diverse prediction tasks. We also demonstrate the generalizability of MedRep through external validation.</description>

      <title>Integrating Visual Interpretation and Linguistic Reasoning for Math Problem Solving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically employ a connector module to link visual features with text embeddings of large language models (LLMs) and use end-to-end training to achieve multi-modal understanding in a unified process. Effective alignment needs high-quality pre-training data and a carefully designed training process. Current LVLMs face challenges when addressing complex vision-language reasoning tasks, with their reasoning capabilities notably lagging behind those of LLMs. This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of training end-to-end vision-language reasoning models, we advocate for developing a decoupled reasoning framework based on existing visual interpretation specialists and text-based reasoning LLMs. Our approach leverages (1) a dedicated vision-language model to transform the visual content of images into textual descriptions and (2) an LLM to perform reasoning according to the visual-derived text and the original question. This method presents a cost-efficient solution for multi-modal model development by optimizing existing models to work collaboratively, avoiding end-to-end development of vision-language models from scratch. By transforming images into language model-compatible text representations, it facilitates future low-cost and flexible upgrades to upcoming powerful LLMs. We introduce an outcome-rewarded joint-tuning strategy to optimize the cooperation between the visual interpretation and linguistic reasoning model. Evaluation results on vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that the decoupled reasoning framework outperforms recent LVLMs. Our approach yields particularly significant performance gains on visually intensive geometric mathematics problems.

      <title>GridRoute: A Benchmark for LLM-Based Route Planning with Cardinal Movement in Grid Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in planning and reasoning tasks, offering a flexible alternative to classical pathfinding algorithms. However, most existing studies focus on LLMs' independent reasoning capabilities and overlook the potential synergy between LLMs and traditional algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation benchmark GridRoute to assess how LLMs can take advantage of traditional algorithms. We also propose a novel hybrid prompting technique called Algorithm of Thought (AoT), which introduces traditional algorithms' guidance into prompting. Our benchmark evaluates six LLMs ranging from 7B to 72B parameters across various map sizes, assessing their performance in correctness, optimality, and efficiency in grid environments with varying sizes. Our results show that AoT significantly boosts performance across all model sizes, particularly in larger or more complex environments, suggesting a promising approach to addressing path planning challenges. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/LinChance/GridRoute.</description>

      <title>AgentOrchestra: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for General-Purpose Task Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in agent systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving both general-purpose and highly complex tasks. However, most current models lack mechanisms for coordinating specialized agents and have limited ability to generalize to new or diverse domains. To this end, we introduce AgentOrchestra, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for general-purpose task solving that integrates high-level planning with modular agent collaboration. Drawing inspiration from a conductor orchestrating a symphony, and grounded in the principles of extensibility, multimodality, modularity, and coordination, it features a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and delegates sub-tasks to a team of specialized agents. Each sub-agent is equipped with general programming tools, as well as abilities to tackle a wide range of real-world specific tasks, including data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and interactive reasoning in dynamic multimodal environments. Notably, AgentOrchestra introduces an MCP Manager Agent that enables intelligent evolution through dynamic tool creation, retrieval, and reuse mechanisms, significantly enhancing the system's adaptability and scalability. AgentOrchestra supports flexible orchestration through explicit sub-goal formulation, inter-agent communication, and adaptive role allocation. We evaluate the framework on three widely used benchmarks for assessing LLM-based agent systems. Experimental results show that AgentOrchestra consistently outperforms flat-agent and monolithic baselines in terms of task success rate and adaptability. On the GAIA benchmark testing dataset, AgentOrchestra achieves an average score of 83.39\%, ranking among the top general-purpose agents. These results highlight the effectiveness of hierarchical organization and role specialization in building scalable and general-purpose LLM-based agent systems.</description>

      <title>MoSE: Skill-by-Skill Mixture-of-Experts Learning for Embodied Autonomous Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present StepFun-Prover Preview, a large language model designed for formal theorem proving through tool-integrated reasoning. Using a reinforcement learning pipeline that incorporates tool-based interactions, StepFun-Prover can achieve strong performance in generating Lean 4 proofs with minimal sampling. Our approach enables the model to emulate human-like problem-solving strategies by iteratively refining proofs based on real-time environment feedback. On the miniF2F-test benchmark, StepFun-Prover achieves a pass@1 success rate of $70.0\%$. Beyond advancing benchmark performance, we introduce an end-to-end training framework for developing tool-integrated reasoning models, offering a promising direction for automated theorem proving and Math AI assistant.</description>

      <title>Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.</description>

      <title>One Subgoal at a Time: Zero-Shot Generalization to Arbitrary Linear Temporal Logic Requirements in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements, yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.</description>

Abstract: This technical report accompanies the LLM robustness leaderboard published by PRISM Eval for the Paris AI Action Summit. We introduce PRISM Eval Behavior Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Do Not Simulate Human Psychology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs),such as ChatGPT, are increasingly used in research, ranging from simple writing assistance to complex data annotation tasks. Recently, some research has suggested that LLMs may even be able to simulate human psychology and can, hence, replace human participants in psychological studies. We caution against this approach. We provide conceptual arguments against the hypothesis that LLMs simulate human psychology. We then present empiric evidence illustrating our arguments by demonstrating that slight changes to wording that correspond to large changes in meaning lead to notable discrepancies between LLMs' and human responses, even for the recent CENTAUR model that was specifically fine-tuned on psychological responses. Additionally, different LLMs show very different responses to novel items, further illustrating their lack of reliability. We conclude that LLMs do not simulate human psychology and recommend that psychological researchers should treat LLMs as useful but fundamentally unreliable tools that need to be validated against human responses for every new application.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Domain-Specific LLM Benchmark Construction: A Comprehensiveness-Compactness Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across various domains.</description>

      <title>Aryabhata: An exam-focused language model for JEE Math</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Aryabhata 1.0, a compact 7B parameter math reasoning model optimized for the Indian academic exam, the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), current models often remain unsuitable for educational use. Aryabhata 1.0 is built by merging strong open-weight reasoning models, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with curriculum learning on verified chain-of-thought (CoT) traces curated through best-of-$n$ rejection sampling. To further boost performance, we apply reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) using A2C objective with group-relative advantage estimation along with novel exploration strategies such as Adaptive Group Resizing and Temperature Scaling. Evaluated on both in-distribution (JEE Main 2025) and out-of-distribution (MATH, GSM8K) benchmarks, Aryabhata outperforms existing models in accuracy and efficiency, while offering pedagogically useful step-by-step reasoning. We release Aryabhata as a foundation model to advance exam-centric, open-source small language models. This marks our first open release for community feedback (https://huggingface.co/PhysicsWallahAI/Aryabhata-1.0); PW is actively training future models to further improve learning outcomes for students.</description>

      <title>SMA: Who Said That? Auditing Membership Leakage in Semi-Black-box RAG Controlling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance, rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities. To address the environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition, SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data provenance in complex generative systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.00583v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tremendous advances have been made in multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). MARL corresponds to the learning problem in a multiagent system in which multiple agents learn simultaneously. It is an interdisciplinary field of study with a long history that includes game theory, machine learning, stochastic control, psychology, and optimization. Despite great successes in MARL, there is a lack of a self-contained overview of the literature that covers game-theoretic foundations of modern MARL methods and summarizes the recent advances. The majority of existing surveys are outdated and do not fully cover the recent developments since 2010. In this work, we provide a monograph on MARL that covers both the fundamentals and the latest developments on the research frontier. The goal of this monograph is to provide a self-contained assessment of the current state-of-the-art MARL techniques from a game-theoretic perspective. We expect this work to serve as a stepping stone for both new researchers who are about to enter this fast-growing field and experts in the field who want to obtain a panoramic view and identify new directions based on recent advances.</description>

      <title>LEAVES: Learning Views for Time-Series Biobehavioral Data in Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has been utilized as a promising self-supervised learning approach to extract meaningful representations from unlabeled data. The majority of these methods take advantage of data-augmentation techniques to create diverse views from the original input. However, optimizing augmentations and their parameters for generating more effective views in contrastive learning frameworks is often resource-intensive and time-consuming. While several strategies have been proposed for automatically generating new views in computer vision, research in other domains, such as time-series biobehavioral data, remains limited. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet powerful module for automatic view generation in contrastive learning frameworks applied to time-series biobehavioral data, which is essential for modern health care, termed learning views for time-series data (LEAVES). This proposed module employs adversarial training to learn augmentation hyperparameters within contrastive learning frameworks. We assess the efficacy of our method on multiple time-series datasets using two well-known contrastive learning frameworks, namely SimCLR and BYOL. Across four diverse biobehavioral datasets, LEAVES requires only approximately 20 learnable parameters -- dramatically fewer than the about 580k parameters demanded by frameworks like ViewMaker, a previously proposed adversarially trained convolutional module in contrastive learning, while achieving competitive and often superior performance to existing baseline methods. Crucially, these efficiency gains are obtained without extensive manual hyperparameter tuning, which makes LEAVES particularly suitable for large-scale or real-time healthcare applications that demand both accuracy and practicality.</description>

      <title>Learning to Defer in Congested Systems: The AI-Human Interplay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12237v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-stakes applications rely on combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) and humans for responsive and reliable decision making. For example, content moderation in social media platforms often employs an AI-human pipeline to promptly remove policy violations without jeopardizing legitimate content. A typical heuristic estimates the risk of incoming content and uses fixed thresholds to decide whether to auto-delete the content (classification) and whether to send it for human review (admission). This approach can be inefficient as it disregards the uncertainty in AI's estimation, the time-varying element of content arrivals and human review capacity, and the selective sampling in the online dataset (humans only review content filtered by the AI).
  In this paper, we introduce a model to capture such an AI-human interplay. In this model, the AI observes contextual information for incoming jobs, makes classification and admission decisions, and schedules admitted jobs for human review. During these reviews, humans observe a job's true cost and may overturn an erroneous AI classification decision. These reviews also serve as new data to train the AI but are delayed due to congestion in the human review system. The objective is to minimize the costs of eventually misclassified jobs.
  We propose a near-optimal learning algorithm that carefully balances the classification loss from a selectively sampled dataset, the idiosyncratic loss of non-reviewed jobs, and the delay loss of having congestion in the human review system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for online learning in contextual queueing systems. Moreover, numerical experiments based on online comment datasets show that our algorithm can substantially reduce the number of misclassifications compared to existing content moderation practice.</description>

      <title>From Model Performance to Claim: How a Change of Focus in Machine Learning Replicability Can Help Bridge the Responsibility Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two goals - improving replicability and accountability of Machine Learning research respectively, have accrued much attention from the AI ethics and the Machine Learning community. Despite sharing the measures of improving transparency, the two goals are discussed in different registers - replicability registers with scientific reasoning whereas accountability registers with ethical reasoning. Given the existing challenge of the Responsibility Gap - holding Machine Learning scientists accountable for Machine Learning harms due to them being far from sites of application, this paper posits that reconceptualizing replicability can help bridge the gap. Through a shift from model performance replicability to claim replicability, Machine Learning scientists can be held accountable for producing non-replicable claims that are prone to eliciting harm due to misuse and misinterpretation. In this paper, I make the following contributions. First, I define and distinguish two forms of replicability for ML research that can aid constructive conversations around replicability. Second, I formulate an argument for claim-replicability's advantage over model performance replicability in justifying assigning accountability to Machine Learning scientists for producing non-replicable claims and show how it enacts a sense of responsibility that is actionable. In addition, I characterize the implementation of claim replicability as more of a social project than a technical one by discussing its competing epistemological principles, practical implications on Circulating Reference, Interpretative Labor, and research communication.</description>

      <title>Robo-Instruct: Simulator-Augmented Instruction Alignment For Finetuning Code LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20179v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code LLMs have shown promising results with converting tasks in natural language to programs that can be executed by service robots. We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.</description>

      <title>Towards Black-Box Membership Inference Attack for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20771v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.</description>

      <title>LUMA: A Benchmark Dataset for Learning from Uncertain and Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Deep Learning enhances decision-making by integrating diverse information sources, such as texts, images, audio, and videos. To develop trustworthy multimodal approaches, it is essential to understand how uncertainty impacts these models. We propose LUMA, a unique multimodal dataset, featuring audio, image, and textual data from 50 classes, specifically designed for learning from uncertain data. It extends the well-known CIFAR 10/100 dataset with audio samples extracted from three audio corpora, and text data generated using the Gemma-7B Large Language Model (LLM). The LUMA dataset enables the controlled injection of varying types and degrees of uncertainty to achieve and tailor specific experiments and benchmarking initiatives. LUMA is also available as a Python package including the functions for generating multiple variants of the dataset with controlling the diversity of the data, the amount of noise for each modality, and adding out-of-distribution samples. A baseline pre-trained model is also provided alongside three uncertainty quantification methods: Monte-Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensemble, and Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning. This comprehensive dataset and its tools are intended to promote and support the development, evaluation, and benchmarking of trustworthy and robust multimodal deep learning approaches. We anticipate that the LUMA dataset will help the research community to design more trustworthy and robust machine learning approaches for safety critical applications. The code and instructions for downloading and processing the dataset can be found at: https://github.com/bezirganyan/LUMA/ .</description>

      <title>Integrating Clinical Knowledge Graphs and Gradient-Based Neural Systems for Enhanced Melanoma Diagnosis via the 7-Point Checklist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 7-point checklist (7PCL) is a widely used diagnostic tool in dermoscopy for identifying malignant melanoma by assigning point values to seven specific attributes. However, the traditional 7PCL is limited to distinguishing between malignant melanoma and melanocytic Nevi, and falls short in scenarios where multiple skin diseases with appearances similar to melanoma coexist. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diagnostic framework that integrates a clinical knowledge-based topological graph (CKTG) with a gradient diagnostic strategy featuring a data-driven weighting system (GD-DDW). The CKTG captures both the internal and external relationships among the 7PCL attributes, while the GD-DDW emulates dermatologists' diagnostic processes, prioritizing visual observation before making predictions. Additionally, we introduce a multimodal feature extraction approach leveraging a dual-attention mechanism to enhance feature extraction through cross-modal interaction and unimodal collaboration. This method incorporates meta-information to uncover interactions between clinical data and image features, ensuring more accurate and robust predictions. Our approach, evaluated on the EDRA dataset, achieved an average AUC of 88.6%, demonstrating superior performance in melanoma detection and feature prediction. This integrated system provides data-driven benchmarks for clinicians, significantly enhancing the precision of melanoma diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Towards flexible perception with visual memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is hard, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build on well-established components to construct a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in "stone" weights.</description>

      <title>SpectralEarth: Training Hyperspectral Foundation Models at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have triggered a paradigm shift in computer vision and are increasingly being adopted in remote sensing, particularly for multispectral imagery. Yet, their potential in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) remains untapped due to the absence of comprehensive and globally representative hyperspectral datasets. To close this gap, we introduce SpectralEarth, a large-scale multitemporal dataset designed to pretrain hyperspectral foundation models leveraging data from the environmental mapping and analysis program (EnMAP). SpectralEarth comprises 538 974 image patches covering 415 153 unique locations from 11 636 globally distributed EnMAP scenes spanning two years of archive. In addition, 17.5% of these locations include multiple timestamps, enabling multitemporal HSI analysis. Utilizing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning algorithms, we pretrain a series of foundation models on SpectralEarth, integrating a spectral adapter into classical vision backbones to accommodate the unique characteristics of HSI. In tandem, we construct nine downstream datasets for land-cover, crop-type mapping, and tree-species classification, providing benchmarks for model evaluation. Experimental results support the versatility of our models and their generalizability across different tasks and sensors. We also highlight computational efficiency during model fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Explaining Caption-Image Interactions in CLIP Models with Second-Order Attributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14153v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual encoder architectures like Clip models map two types of inputs into a shared embedding space and predict similarities between them. Despite their wide application, it is, however, not understood how these models compare their two inputs. Common first-order feature-attribution methods explain importances of individual features and can, thus, only provide limited insights into dual encoders, whose predictions depend on interactions between features. In this paper, we first derive a second-order method enabling the attribution of predictions by any differentiable dual encoder onto feature-interactions between its inputs. Second, we apply our method to Clip models and show that they learn fine-grained correspondences between parts of captions and regions in images. They match objects across input modes and also account for mismatches. This intrinsic visual-linguistic grounding ability, however, varies heavily between object classes, exhibits pronounced out-of-domain effects and we can identify individual errors as well as systematic failure categories.

      <description>arXiv:2408.15462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have continued to gain prevalence in the modern era for their ability to model complex data through pattern recognition and behavior remodeling. However, the static construction of traditional neural networks inhibits dynamic intelligence. This makes them inflexible to temporal changes in data and unfit to capture complex dependencies. With the advent of quantum technology, there has been significant progress in creating quantum algorithms. In recent years, researchers have developed quantum neural networks that leverage the capabilities of qubits to outperform classical networks. However, their current formulation exhibits a static construction limiting the system's dynamic intelligence. To address these weaknesses, we develop a Liquid Quantum Neural Network (LQNet) and a Continuous Time Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (CTRQNet). Both models demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing quantum neural networks (QNNs), achieving accuracy increases as high as 40\% on CIFAR 10 through binary classification. We propose LQNets and CTRQNets might shine a light on quantum machine learning's black box.</description>

      <title>Pediatric brain tumor classification using digital histopathology and deep learning: evaluation of SOTA methods on a multi-center Swedish cohort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children and young adults, but the scarcity of large histopathology datasets has limited the application of computational pathology in this group. This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI, and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family, and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and ABMIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.60$\pm$0.05 for tumor category, family, and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</description>

      <title>Return Prediction for Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection: How Decision-Focused Learning Shapes Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markowitz laid the foundation of portfolio theory through the mean-variance optimization (MVO) framework. However, the effectiveness of MVO is contingent on the precise estimation of expected returns, variances, and covariances of asset returns, which are typically uncertain. Machine learning models are becoming useful in estimating uncertain parameters, and such models are trained to minimize prediction errors, such as mean squared errors (MSE), which treat prediction errors uniformly across assets. Recent studies have pointed out that this approach would lead to suboptimal decisions and proposed Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) as a solution, integrating prediction and optimization to improve decision-making outcomes. While studies have shown DFL's potential to enhance portfolio performance, the detailed mechanisms of how DFL modifies prediction models for MVO remain unexplored. This study investigates how DFL adjusts stock return prediction models to optimize decisions in MVO. Theoretically, we show that DFL's gradient can be interpreted as tilting the MSE-based prediction errors by the inverse covariance matrix, effectively incorporating inter-asset correlations into the learning process, while MSE treats each asset's error independently. This tilting mechanism leads to systematic prediction biases where DFL overestimates returns for assets included in portfolios while underestimating excluded assets. Our findings reveal why DFL achieves superior portfolio performance despite higher prediction errors. The strategic biases are features, not flaws.</description>

      <title>Episodic Memory Verbalization using Hierarchical Representations of Life-Long Robot Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verbalization of robot experience, i.e., summarization of and question answering about a robot's past, is a crucial ability for improving human-robot interaction. Previous works applied rule-based systems or fine-tuned deep models to verbalize short (several-minute-long) streams of episodic data, limiting generalization and transferability. In our work, we apply large pretrained models to tackle this task with zero or few examples, and specifically focus on verbalizing life-long experiences. For this, we derive a tree-like data structure from episodic memory (EM), with lower levels representing raw perception and proprioception data, and higher levels abstracting events to natural language concepts. Given such a hierarchical representation built from the experience stream, we apply a large language model as an agent to interactively search the EM given a user's query, dynamically expanding (initially collapsed) tree nodes to find the relevant information. The approach keeps computational costs low even when scaling to months of robot experience data. We evaluate our method on simulated household robot data, human egocentric videos, and real-world robot recordings, demonstrating its flexibility and scalability.</description>

      <title>Downscaling Extreme Precipitation with Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00381v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the risks posed by extreme rainfall events requires analysis of precipitation fields with high resolution (to assess localized hazards) and extensive historical coverage (to capture sufficient examples of rare occurrences). Radar and mesonet networks provide precipitation fields at 1 km resolution but with limited historical and geographical coverage, while gauge-based records and reanalysis products cover decades of time on a global scale, but only at 30-50 km resolution. To help provide high-resolution precipitation estimates over long time scales, this study presents Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a diffusion framework to downscale (super-resolve) precipitation fields from low-resolution gauge and reanalysis products. Crucially, unlike related deep generative models, WassDiff integrates a Wasserstein distribution-matching regularizer to the denoising process to reduce empirical biases at extreme intensities. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff quantitatively outperforms existing state-of-the-art generative downscaling methods at recovering extreme weather phenomena such as tropical storms and cold fronts. Case studies further qualitatively demonstrate WassDiff's ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale weather structures and accurate peak intensities. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer: External Memory for In-context RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by observing a few exemplars in its context. While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings. Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context. Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT). RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation. The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. We evaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length. Furthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions. To facilitate future research, we release datasets for four of the considered environments.</description>

      <title>Depth-Guided Self-Supervised Human Keypoint Detection via Cross-Modal Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing unsupervised keypoint detection methods apply artificial deformations to images such as masking a significant portion of images and using reconstruction of original image as a learning objective to detect keypoints. However, this approach lacks depth information in the image and often detects keypoints on the background. To address this, we propose Distill-DKP, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that leverages depth maps and RGB images for keypoint detection in a self-supervised setting. During training, Distill-DKP extracts embedding-level knowledge from a depth-based teacher model to guide an image-based student model with inference restricted to the student. Experiments show that Distill-DKP significantly outperforms previous unsupervised methods by reducing mean L2 error by 47.15% on Human3.6M, mean average error by 5.67% on Taichi, and improving keypoints accuracy by 1.3% on DeepFashion dataset. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate the sensitivity of knowledge distillation across different layers of the network. Project Page: https://23wm13.github.io/distill-dkp/</description>

      <title>Learning Characteristics of Reverse Quaternion Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a new multi-layer feedforward quaternion neural network model architecture, Reverse Quaternion Neural Network which utilizes the non-commutative nature of quaternion products, and to clarify its learning characteristics. While quaternion neural networks have been used in various fields, there has been no research report on the characteristics of multi-layer feedforward quaternion neural networks where weights are applied in the reverse direction. This paper investigates the learning characteristics of the Reverse Quaternion Neural Network from two perspectives: the learning speed and the generalization on rotation. As a result, it is found that the Reverse Quaternion Neural Network has a learning speed comparable to existing models and can obtain a different rotation representation from the existing models.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Audio and Text Modalities in Mental Health: A Study of LLMs Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mental health disorders are increasingly prevalent worldwide, creating an urgent need for innovative tools to support early diagnosis and intervention. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multimodal mental health diagnostics, specifically for detecting depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder through text and audio modalities. Using the E-DAIC dataset, we compare text and audio modalities to investigate whether LLMs can perform equally well or better with audio inputs. We further examine the integration of both modalities to determine if this can enhance diagnostic accuracy, which generally results in improved performance metrics. Our analysis specifically utilizes custom-formulated metrics; Modal Superiority Score and Disagreement Resolvement Score to evaluate how combined modalities influence model performance. The Gemini 1.5 Pro model achieves the highest scores in binary depression classification when using the combined modality, with an F1 score of 0.67 and a Balanced Accuracy (BA) of 77.4%, assessed across the full dataset. These results represent an increase of 3.1% over its performance with the text modality and 2.7% over the audio modality, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Notably, all results are obtained in zero-shot inferring, highlighting the robustness of the models without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. To explore the impact of different configurations on model performance, we conduct binary, severity, and multiclass tasks using both zero-shot and few-shot prompts, examining the effects of prompt variations on performance. The results reveal that models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro in text and audio modalities, and GPT-4o mini in the text modality, often surpass other models in balanced accuracy and F1 scores across multiple tasks.</description>

      <title>SLTNet: Efficient Event-based Semantic Segmentation with Spike-driven Lightweight Transformer-based Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation has great potential in autonomous driving and robotics due to the advantages of event cameras, such as high dynamic range, low latency, and low power cost. Unfortunately, current artificial neural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational demands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption, limiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile platforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven lightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic segmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven convolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the model's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature interaction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with binary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a high-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy consumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at most 9.06% and 9.39% mIoU, respectively, with extremely 4.58x lower energy consumption and 114 FPS inference speed. Our code is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/longxianlei/SLTNet-v1.0.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Bio-Inspired Models under Different Learning Settings For Energy Efficiency in Network Traffic Prediction</title>

Abstract: Cellular traffic forecasting is a critical task that enables network operators to efficiently allocate resources and address anomalies in rapidly evolving environments. The exponential growth of data collected from base stations poses significant challenges to processing and analysis. While machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for handling these large datasets and providing accurate predictions, their environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption, is often overlooked in favor of their predictive capabilities. This study investigates the potential of two bio-inspired models: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Reservoir Computing through Echo State Networks (ESNs) for cellular traffic forecasting. The evaluation focuses on both their predictive performance and energy efficiency. These models are implemented in both centralized and federated settings to analyze their effectiveness and energy consumption in decentralized systems. Additionally, we compare bio-inspired models with traditional architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Using data collected from three diverse locations in Barcelona, Spain, we examine the trade-offs between predictive accuracy and energy demands across these approaches. The results indicate that bio-inspired models, such as SNNs and ESNs, can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to traditional architectures. Furthermore, federated implementations were tested to evaluate their energy efficiency in decentralized settings compared to centralized systems, particularly in combination with bio-inspired models. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of bio-inspired models for sustainable and privacy-preserving cellular traffic forecasting.</description>

      <title>Beyond Memorization: Assessing Semantic Generalization in Large Language Models Using Phrasal Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The web-scale of pretraining data has created an important evaluation challenge: to disentangle linguistic competence on cases well-represented in pretraining data from generalization to out-of-domain language, specifically the dynamic, real-world instances less common in pretraining data. To this end, we construct a diagnostic evaluation to systematically assess natural language understanding in LLMs by leveraging Construction Grammar (CxG). CxG provides a psycholinguistically grounded framework for testing generalization, as it explicitly links syntactic forms to abstract, non-lexical meanings. Our novel inference evaluation dataset consists of English phrasal constructions, for which speakers are known to be able to abstract over commonplace instantiations in order to understand and produce creative instantiations. Our evaluation dataset uses CxG to evaluate two central questions: first, if models can 'understand' the semantics of sentences for instances that are likely to appear in pretraining data less often, but are intuitive and easy for people to understand. Second, if LLMs can deploy the appropriate constructional semantics given constructions that are syntactically identical but with divergent meanings. Our results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including GPT-o1, exhibit a performance drop of over 40% on our second task, revealing a failure to generalize over syntactically identical forms to arrive at distinct constructional meanings in the way humans do. We make our novel dataset and associated experimental data, including prompts and model responses, publicly available.</description>

      <title>GenAI Confessions: Black-box Membership Inference for Generative Image Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a simple text prompt, generative-AI image models can create stunningly realistic and creative images bounded, it seems, by only our imagination. These models have achieved this remarkable feat thanks, in part, to the ingestion of billions of images collected from nearly every corner of the internet. Many creators have understandably expressed concern over how their intellectual property has been ingested without their permission or a mechanism to opt out of training. As a result, questions of fair use and copyright infringement have quickly emerged. We describe a method that allows us to determine if a model was trained on a specific image or set of images. This method is computationally efficient and assumes no explicit knowledge of the model architecture or weights (so-called black-box membership inference). We anticipate that this method will be crucial for auditing existing models and, looking ahead, ensuring the fairer development and deployment of generative AI models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLMs' Mathematical Reasoning with Unseen Random Variables Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11790v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have raised significant concerns regarding the reliability of current mathematics benchmarks, highlighting issues such as simplistic design and potential data contamination. Consequently, developing a reliable benchmark that effectively evaluates large language models' (LLMs) genuine capabilities in mathematical reasoning remains a critical challenge. To address these concerns, we propose RV-Bench, a novel evaluation methodology for Benchmarking LLMs with Random Variables in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we build question-generating functions to produce random variable questions (RVQs), whose background content mirrors original benchmark problems, but with randomized variable combinations, rendering them "unseen" to LLMs. Models must completely understand the inherent question pattern to correctly answer RVQs with diverse variable combinations. Thus, an LLM's genuine reasoning capability is reflected through its accuracy and robustness on RV-Bench. We conducted extensive experiments on over 30 representative LLMs across more than 1,000 RVQs. Our findings propose that LLMs exhibit a proficiency imbalance between encountered and ``unseen'' data distributions. Furthermore, RV-Bench reveals that proficiency generalization across similar mathematical reasoning tasks is limited, but we verified it can still be effectively elicited through test-time scaling.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction of Classifiers with Many Classes based on Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) controls the prediction uncertainty of classification systems by producing a small prediction set, ensuring a predetermined probability that the true class lies within this set. This is commonly done by defining a score, based on the model predictions, and setting a threshold on this score using a validation set. In this study, we address the problem of CP calibration when we only have access to a calibration set with noisy labels. We show how we can estimate the noise-free conformal threshold based on the noisy labeled data. We derive a finite sample coverage guarantee for uniform noise that remains effective even in tasks with a large number of classes. We dub our approach Noise-Aware Conformal Prediction (NACP). We illustrate the performance of the proposed results on several standard image classification datasets with a large number of classes.</description>

      <title>EvoP: Robust LLM Inference via Evolutionary Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, but their massive size and computational demands hinder their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing model pruning methods address this issue by removing redundant structures (e.g., elements, channels, layers) from the model. However, these methods employ a heuristic pruning strategy, which leads to suboptimal performance. Besides, they also ignore the data characteristics when pruning the model.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose EvoP, an evolutionary pruning framework for robust LLM inference. EvoP first presents a cluster-based calibration dataset sampling (CCDS) strategy for creating a more diverse calibration dataset. EvoP then introduces an evolutionary pruning pattern searching (EPPS) method to find the optimal pruning pattern. Compared to existing model pruning techniques, EvoP achieves the best performance while maintaining the best efficiency. Experiments across different LLMs and different downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of the proposed EvoP, making it a practical and scalable solution for deploying LLMs in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>One-shot Optimized Steering Vectors Mediate Safety-relevant Behaviors in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steering vectors (SVs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing SVs through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these SVs generalize. We consider several SV optimization techniques and find that the resulting SVs effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot SVs that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized SVs can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, we extend work on "emergent misalignment" and show that SVs optimized to induce a model to write vulnerable code cause the model to respond harmfully on unrelated open-ended prompts. Finally, we use one-shot SV optimization to investigate how an instruction-tuned LLM recovers from outputting false information, and find that this ability is independent of the model's explicit verbalization that the information was false. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing SVs on a single example can mediate a wide array of misaligned behaviors in LLMs. Code can be found at https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro and https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-misalignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) method that mitigates the rigidity of fixed reward structures and the limited flexibility of implicit reward regularization. Building on the Maximum Entropy IRL framework, our approach incorporates a squared temporal-difference (TD) regularizer with adaptive targets that evolve dynamically during training, thereby imposing adaptive bounds on recovered rewards and promoting robust decision-making. To capture richer return information, we integrate distributional RL into the learning process. Empirically, our method achieves expert-level performance on complex MuJoCo tasks, surpassing baseline methods on the Humanoid task with 3 demonstrations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the approach and provide insights into reward dynamics in imitation learning.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Real World: A Unified Survey of Multimodal Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Shifting Perspectives: Steering Vectors for Robust Bias Mitigation in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs) by applying steering vectors to modify model activations in forward passes. We compute 8 steering vectors, each corresponding to a different social bias axis, such as age, gender, or race, on a training subset of the BBQ dataset and compare the effectiveness of these to 3 additional bias mitigation methods across 4 datasets. When optimized on the BBQ dataset, our individually tuned steering vectors achieve average improvements of 12.8% on BBQ, 8.3% on CLEAR-Bias, and 1% on StereoSet, and show improvements over prompting and Self-Debias in all cases, and improvements over fine-tuning in 12 out of 17 evaluations. In addition, steering vectors showed the lowest impact on MMLU scores of the four bias mitigation methods tested. The work presents the first systematic investigation of steering vectors for bias mitigation, and we demonstrate that they are a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for reducing bias in LLMs, with broader implications for enhancing AI safety.</description>

      <title>The Illusory Normativity of Rights-Based AI Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether and how to regulate AI is now a central question of governance. Across academic, policy, and international legal circles, the European Union is widely treated as the normative leader in this space. Its regulatory framework, anchored in the General Data Protection Regulation, the Digital Services and Markets Acts, and the AI Act, is often portrayed as a principled model grounded in fundamental rights. This Article challenges that assumption. We argue that the rights-based narrative surrounding EU AI regulation mischaracterizes the logic of its institutional design. While rights language pervades EU legal instruments, its function is managerial, not foundational. These rights operate as tools of administrative ordering, used to mitigate technological disruption, manage geopolitical risk, and preserve systemic balance, rather than as expressions of moral autonomy or democratic consent. Drawing on comparative institutional analysis, we situate EU AI governance within a longer tradition of legal ordering shaped by the need to coordinate power across fragmented jurisdictions. We contrast this approach with the American model, which reflects a different regulatory logic rooted in decentralized authority, sectoral pluralism, and a constitutional preference for innovation and individual autonomy. Through case studies in five key domains -- data privacy, cybersecurity, healthcare, labor, and disinformation -- we show that EU regulation is not meaningfully rights-driven, as is often claimed. It is instead structured around the containment of institutional risk. Our aim is not to endorse the American model but to reject the presumption that the EU approach reflects a normative ideal that other nations should uncritically adopt. The EU model is best understood as a historically contingent response to its own political conditions, not a template for others to blindly follow.</description>

      <title>FT-Transformer: Resilient and Reliable Transformer with End-to-End Fault Tolerant Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models rely on High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources for inference, where soft errors are inevitable in large-scale systems, making the reliability of the model particularly critical. Existing fault tolerance frameworks for Transformers are designed at the operation level without architectural optimization, leading to significant computational and memory overhead, which in turn reduces protection efficiency and limits scalability to larger models. In this paper, we implement module-level protection for Transformers by treating the operations within the attention module as a single kernel and applying end-to-end fault tolerance. This method provides unified protection across multi-step computations, while achieving comprehensive coverage of potential errors in the nonlinear computations. For linear modules, we design a strided algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) that avoids inter-thread communication. Experimental results show that our end-to-end fault tolerance achieves up to 7.56x speedup over traditional methods with an average fault tolerance overhead of 13.9%.</description>

      <title>CO-Bench: Benchmarking Language Model Agents in Algorithm Search for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although LLM-based agents have attracted significant attention in domains such as software engineering and machine learning research, their role in advancing combinatorial optimization (CO) remains relatively underexplored. This gap underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their potential in tackling structured, constraint-intensive problems -- a pursuit currently limited by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for systematic investigation. To address this, we introduce CO-Bench, a benchmark suite featuring 36 real-world CO problems drawn from a broad range of domains and complexity levels. CO-Bench includes structured problem formulations and curated data to support rigorous investigation of LLM agents. We evaluate multiple agentic frameworks against established human-designed algorithms, revealing the strengths and limitations of existing LLM agents and identifying promising directions for future research. CO-Bench is publicly available at https://github.com/sunnweiwei/CO-Bench.</description>

      <title>Mosaic: Composite Projection Pruning for Resource-efficient LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extensive compute and memory requirements limit the deployment of large language models (LLMs) on any hardware. Compression methods, such as pruning, can reduce model size, which in turn reduces resource requirements. State-of-the-art pruning is based on coarse-grained methods. They are time-consuming and inherently remove critical model parameters, adversely impacting the quality of the pruned model. This paper introduces projection pruning, a novel fine-grained method for pruning LLMs. In addition, LLM projection pruning is enhanced by a new approach we refer to as composite projection pruning - the synergistic combination of unstructured pruning that retains accuracy and structured pruning that reduces model size. We develop Mosaic, a novel system to create and deploy pruned LLMs using composite projection pruning. Mosaic is evaluated using a range of performance and quality metrics on multiple hardware platforms, LLMs, and datasets. Mosaic is 7.19x faster in producing models than existing approaches. Mosaic models achieve up to 84.2% lower perplexity and 31.4% higher accuracy than models obtained from coarse-grained pruning. Up to 67% faster inference and 68% lower GPU memory use is noted for Mosaic models. Mosaic is available for public use from https://github.com/blessonvar/Mosaic</description>

      <title>GraspClutter6D: A Large-scale Real-world Dataset for Robust Perception and Grasping in Cluttered Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust grasping in cluttered environments remains an open challenge in robotics. While benchmark datasets have significantly advanced deep learning methods, they mainly focus on simplistic scenes with light occlusion and insufficient diversity, limiting their applicability to practical scenarios. We present GraspClutter6D, a large-scale real-world grasping dataset featuring: (1) 1,000 highly cluttered scenes with dense arrangements (14.1 objects/scene, 62.6\% occlusion), (2) comprehensive coverage across 200 objects in 75 environment configurations (bins, shelves, and tables) captured using four RGB-D cameras from multiple viewpoints, and (3) rich annotations including 736K 6D object poses and 9.3B feasible robotic grasps for 52K RGB-D images. We benchmark state-of-the-art segmentation, object pose estimation, and grasp detection methods to provide key insights into challenges in cluttered environments. Additionally, we validate the dataset's effectiveness as a training resource, demonstrating that grasping networks trained on GraspClutter6D significantly outperform those trained on existing datasets in both simulation and real-world experiments. The dataset, toolkit, and annotation tools are publicly available on our project website: https://sites.google.com/view/graspclutter6d.</description>

      <title>AI-Slop to AI-Polish? Aligning Language Models through Edit-Based Writing Rewards and Test-time Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-generated text is proliferating across domains, from creative writing and journalism to marketing content and scientific articles. Models can follow user-provided instructions to generate coherent and grammatically correct outputs but in this work, we study a more fundamental question: how do we evaluate and improve the writing quality of AI-generated text? Writing quality assessment has received less attention from the community, in part because it is fundamentally subjective and requires expertise. We first introduce the Writing Quality Benchmark (WQ) by consolidating five writing-preference datasets into 4,729 writing quality judgments. Our experiments show that most of the competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs that excel at reasoning tasks, barely outperform random baselines on WQ. We then train specialized Writing Quality Reward Models (WQRM) of various sizes for writing quality assessment that demonstrate strong generalization on four out-of-distribution test sets and 74% accuracy on the WQ benchmark. To further show WQRM's practical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute to generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select higher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9 experienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples preferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than 1 point. We release our datasets and models to encourage community engagement with writing quality assessment and development of AI writing systems better aligned with human preferences.</description>

      <title>FedRecon: Missing Modality Reconstruction in Heterogeneous Distributed Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal data are often incomplete and exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics in real-world scenarios. These inherent limitations lead to both modality heterogeneity through partial modality absence and data heterogeneity from distribution divergence, creating fundamental challenges for effective federated learning (FL). To address these coupled challenges, we propose FedRecon, the first method targeting simultaneous missing modality reconstruction and Non-IID adaptation in multimodal FL. Our approach first employs a lightweight Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) to reconstruct missing modalities while preserving cross-modal consistency. Distinct from conventional imputation methods, we achieve sample-level alignment through a novel distribution mapping mechanism that guarantees both data consistency and completeness. Additionally, we introduce a strategy employing global generator freezing to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which in turn mitigates Non-IID fluctuations. Extensive evaluations on multimodal datasets demonstrate FedRecon's superior performance in modality reconstruction under Non-IID conditions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>EmoVoice: LLM-based Emotional Text-To-Speech Model with Freestyle Text Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12867v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and chain-of-modality (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech. Dataset, code, checkpoints, and demo samples are available at https://github.com/yanghaha0908/EmoVoice.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Warm Starts for Trajectory Optimization on the International Space Station</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory optimization is a cornerstone of modern robot autonomy, enabling systems to compute trajectories and controls in real-time while respecting safety and physical constraints. However, it has seen limited usage in spaceflight applications due to its heavy computational demands that exceed the capability of most flight computers. In this work, we provide results on the first flight demonstration of using machine learning-based warm starts for accelerating trajectory optimization for the Astrobee free-flying robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). We formulate a data-driven optimal control approach that trains a neural network to learn the structure of the trajectory generation problem being solved for by sequential convex programming (SCP). On-board, this trained neural network predicts solutions for the trajectory generation problem and relies on using the SCP solver to enforce safety constraints for the system. Our trained network reduces the number of solver iterations required for convergence in cases including rotational dynamics by 60% and in cases with obstacles drawn from the training distribution of the warm start model by 50%. This work represents a significant milestone in the use of learning-based control for spaceflight applications and a stepping stone for future advances in the use of machine learning for autonomous guidance, navigation, &amp; control.</description>

      <title>Halting Recurrent GNNs and the Graded $\mu$-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of machine-learning models that operate on graph-structured data. Their expressive power is intimately related to logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for recurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or suffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a halting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can express all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for the standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. To prove our main result, we develop a new approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of independent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking algorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size. In a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a halting recurrent GNN.</description>

      <title>Can Large Multimodal Models Understand Agricultural Scenes? Benchmarking with AgroMind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated capabilities across various domains, but comprehensive benchmarks for agricultural remote sensing (RS) remain scarce. Existing benchmarks designed for agricultural RS scenarios exhibit notable limitations, primarily in terms of insufficient scene diversity in the dataset and oversimplified task design. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgroMind, a comprehensive agricultural remote sensing benchmark covering four task dimensions: spatial perception, object understanding, scene understanding, and scene reasoning, with a total of 13 task types, ranging from crop identification and health monitoring to environmental analysis. We curate a high-quality evaluation set by integrating eight public datasets and one private farmland plot dataset, containing 27,247 QA pairs and 19,615 images. The pipeline begins with multi-source data pre-processing, including collection, format standardization, and annotation refinement. We then generate a diverse set of agriculturally relevant questions through the systematic definition of tasks. Finally, we employ LMMs for inference, generating responses, and performing detailed examinations. We evaluated 20 open-source LMMs and 4 closed-source models on AgroMind. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps, particularly in spatial reasoning and fine-grained recognition, it is notable that human performance lags behind several leading LMMs. By establishing a standardized evaluation framework for agricultural RS, AgroMind reveals the limitations of LMMs in domain knowledge and highlights critical challenges for future work. Data and code can be accessed at https://rssysu.github.io/AgroMind/.</description>

      <title>Teaching Large Language Models to Maintain Contextual Faithfulness via Synthetic Tasks and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to reduce faithfulness hallucinations of LLMs across different downstream tasks without human annotations. Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different tasks, even outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.</description>

      <title>MapStory: Prototyping Editable Map Animations with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MapStory, an LLM-powered animation prototyping tool that generates editable map animation sequences directly from natural language text by leveraging a dual-agent LLM architecture. Given a user written script, MapStory automatically produces a scene breakdown, which decomposes the text into key map animation primitives such as camera movements, visual highlights, and animated elements. Our system includes a researcher agent that accurately queries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling automatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while allowing users to edit and query for changes or additional information to refine the results. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these primitive blocks through an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design and architecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators and by an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which includes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates that MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates faster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to creating map-centric stories.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scaling Laws for EHR Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies. Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized healthcare.</description>

      <title>Sarc7: Evaluating Sarcasm Detection and Generation with Seven Types and Emotion-Informed Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sarcasm is a form of humor where expressions convey meanings opposite to their literal interpretations. Classifying and generating sarcasm using large language models is vital for interpreting human communication. Sarcasm poses challenges for computational models, due to its nuanced nature. We introduce Sarc7, a benchmark that classifies 7 types of sarcasm: self-deprecating, brooding, deadpan, polite, obnoxious, raging, and manic by annotating entries of the MUStARD dataset. Classification was evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and a novel emotion-based prompting technique. We propose an emotion-based generation method developed by identifying key components of sarcasm-incongruity, shock value, and context dependency. Our classification experiments show that Gemini 2.5, using emotion-based prompting, outperforms other setups with an F1 score of 0.3664. Human evaluators preferred our emotion-based prompting, with 38.46% more successful generations than zero-shot prompting.</description>

      <title>Gradual Transition from Bellman Optimality Operator to Bellman Operator in Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement, which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC, significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to hyperparameters related to optimality. The code for this study is available at https://github.com/motokiomura/annealed-q-learning.</description>

      <title>ChineseHarm-Bench: A Chinese Harmful Content Detection Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Model Acceleration and Optimization Strategies for Real-Time Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online recommendation services.</description>

      <title>MGDFIS: Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy for Small Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks, achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV platforms.</description>

      <title>Poison Once, Control Anywhere: Clean-Text Visual Backdoors in VLM-based Mobile Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13205v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted for tasks such as UI automation and camera-based assistance. These agents are typically fine-tuned using small-scale, user-collected data, making them susceptible to stealthy training-time threats. This work introduces VIBMA, the first clean-text backdoor attack targeting VLM-based mobile agents. The attack injects malicious behaviors into the model by modifying only the visual input while preserving textual prompts and instructions, achieving stealth through the complete absence of textual anomalies. Once the agent is fine-tuned on this poisoned data, adding a predefined visual pattern (trigger) at inference time activates the attacker-specified behavior (backdoor). Our attack aligns the training gradients of poisoned samples with those of an attacker-specified target instance, effectively embedding backdoor-specific features into the poisoned data. To ensure the robustness and stealthiness of the attack, we design three trigger variants that better resemble real-world scenarios: static patches, dynamic motion patterns, and low-opacity blended content. Extensive experiments on six Android applications and three mobile-compatible VLMs demonstrate that our attack achieves high success rates (ASR up to 94.67%) while preserving clean-task behavior (FSR up to 95.85%). We further conduct ablation studies to understand how key design factors impact attack reliability and stealth. These findings is the first to reveal the security vulnerabilities of mobile agents and their susceptibility to backdoor injection, underscoring the need for robust defenses in mobile agent adaptation pipelines.</description>

      <title>Open-Set LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation Guided by Uncertainty-Aware Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.</description>

      <title>HVL: Semi-Supervised Segmentation leveraging Hierarchical Vision-Language Synergy with Dynamic Text-Spatial Query Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation (SSS) under domain shift by leveraging domain-invariant semantic knowledge from text embeddings of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We propose a unified Hierarchical Vision-Language framework (HVL) that integrates domain-invariant text embeddings as object queries in a transformer-based segmentation network to improve generalization and reduce misclassification under limited supervision. The mentioned textual queries are used for grouping pixels with shared semantics under SSS. HVL is designed to (1) generate textual queries that maximally encode domain-invariant semantics from VLM while capturing intra-class variations; (2) align these queries with spatial visual features to enhance their segmentation ability and improve the semantic clarity of visual features. We also introduce targeted regularization losses that maintain vision--language alignment throughout training to reinforce semantic understanding. HVL establishes a novel state-of-the-art by achieving a +9.3% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on COCO, utilizing 232 labelled images, +3.1% on Pascal VOC employing 92 labels, +4.8% on ADE20 using 316 labels, and +3.4% on Cityscapes with 100 labels, demonstrating superior performance with less than 1% supervision on four benchmark datasets. Our results show that language-guided segmentation bridges the label efficiency gap and enables new levels of fine-grained generalization.</description>

      <title>Human Motion Capture from Loose and Sparse Inertial Sensors with Garment-aware Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking. Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present Garment Inertial Poser (GaIP), a method for estimating full-body poses from sparse and loosely attached IMU sensors. We first simulate IMU recordings using an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. Our transformer-based diffusion models synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses from this challenging loose IMU data. We also demonstrate that incorporating garment-related parameters during training on loose IMU data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Our experiments show that our diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperform state-of-the-art inertial full-body pose estimators, both quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research on motion capture from such realistic sensor placements.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Being Lazy: Scaling Limits of Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent efforts, neural networks still struggle to learn in non-stationary environments, and our understanding of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is far from complete. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning. We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers across model scales. This work provides a unified perspective on the role of scale and feature learning in continual learning.</description>

      <title>SWA-SOP: Spatially-aware Window Attention for Semantic Occupancy Prediction in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields consistent gains across modalities.</description>

      <title>OC-SOP: Enhancing Vision-Based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction by Object-Centric Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However, conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP (OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all categories on SemanticKITTI.</description>

However, these tools typically present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability to critically evaluate outputs, form accurate mental models, and calibrate trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple suggestion into a transparent, explainable interaction. CopilotLens operates as an explanation layer that reconstructs the AI agent's "thought process" through a dynamic, two-level interface. The tool aims to surface both high-level code changes and the specific codebase context influences. This paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete framework and articulating expectations on deepening comprehension and calibrated trust, which we plan to evaluate in subsequent work.</description>

      <title>Audio-3DVG: Unified Audio -- Point Cloud Fusion for 3D Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components. First, we introduce (i) Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an (ii) Audio-Guided Attention module that models the interactions between target candidates and mentioned objects, enhancing discrimination in cluttered 3D environments. To support benchmarking, we (iii) synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods, highlight the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.</description>

      <title>WebArXiv: Evaluating Multimodal Agents on Time-Invariant arXiv Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development of autonomous web agents capable of navigating and interacting with real websites. However, evaluating such agents remains challenging due to the instability and inconsistency of existing benchmarks, which often rely on dynamic content or oversimplified simulations. In this work, we introduce WebArXiv, a static and time-invariant benchmark comprising 275 web-based tasks grounded in the arXiv platform. WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable evaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground truths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we identify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents over-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a lightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively retrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance differences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed reflection strategy.</description>

      <title>GLM-4.1V-Thinking and GLM-4.5V: Towards Versatile Multimodal Reasoning with Scalable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01006v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking and GLM-4.5V, a family of vision-language models (VLMs) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V.</description>

      <title>Fragment size density estimator for shrinkage-induced fracture based on a physics-informed neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model structures.</description>

      <title>A multi-strategy improved snake optimizer for three-dimensional UAV path planning and engineering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms have gained widespread application across various fields owing to their ability to generate diverse solutions. One such algorithm is the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO suffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local optima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy Improved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random disturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting trapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight strategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with flight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the local optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a position update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion, effectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision. Finally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test functions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms across different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its advantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path planning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are still challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we apply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design problems to assess its feasibility in practical applications. The experimental results demonstrate that MISO exceeds other competitive algorithms in terms of solution quality and stability, establishing its strong potential for application.</description>

      <title>DRWKV: Focusing on Object Edges for Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>LiteFat: Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning for Real-Time Driver Fatigue Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</description>

      <title>Estimating Worst-Case Frontier Risks of Open-Weight LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss. We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.</description>

      <title>Block: Balancing Load in LLM Serving with Context, Knowledge and Predictive Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Block, a distributed scheduling framework designed to optimize load balancing and auto-provisioning across instances in large language model serving frameworks by leveraging contextual information from incoming requests. Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed, stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead, reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations. Code and data are open-sourced.</description>

      <title>GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FairPOT: Balancing AUC Performance and Fairness with Proportional Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains, fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore, we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic, public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios, often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>GTPO and GRPO-S: Token and Sequence-Level Reward Shaping with Policy Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks. This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.</description>

      <title>Chemist Eye: A Visual Language Model-Powered System for Safety Monitoring and Robot Decision-Making in Self-Driving Laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories (SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras, designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.</description>

      <title>Request-Only Optimization for Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) represent one of the largest machine learning applications on the planet. Industry-scale DLRMs are trained with petabytes of recommendation data to serve billions of users every day. To utilize the rich user signals in the long user history, DLRMs have been scaled up to unprecedented complexity, up to trillions of floating-point operations (TFLOPs) per example. This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training data, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve the quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present a Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO simultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the model quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this challenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure (i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture (i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling paradigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data. Compared with the established practice of treating a user impression as a unit, our new design achieves native feature deduplication in data logging, consequently saving data storage. Second, by de-duplicating computations and communications across multiple impressions in a request, this new paradigm enables highly scaled-up neural network architectures to better capture user interest signals, such as Generative Recommenders (GRs) and other request-only friendly architectures.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Pretrained Molecular Embedding Models For Molecular Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities, architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer practical recommendations.</description>

      <title>InfoCausalQA:Can Models Perform Non-explicit Causal Reasoning Based on Infographic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in perception and reasoning. However, the ability to perform causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored, particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect, intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494 infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate 1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.</description>

      <title>Memp: Exploring Agent Procedural Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory. Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a weaker model yields substantial performance gains.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Scaling Laws for Dense and Sparse Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, the size of language models has grown exponentially, as has the computational cost to train these large models. This rapid growth has motivated researchers to develop new techniques aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the training process. Despite these advancements, optimally predicting the model size or allocating optimal resources remains a challenge. Several efforts have addressed the challenge by proposing different scaling laws, but almost all of them are architecture-specific (dense or sparse). In this work we revisit existing scaling laws and propose a generalized scaling law to provide a unified framework that is applicable to both dense and sparse large language models. We evaluate and compare our proposed scaling law with existing scaling laws to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Fairness of Automatic Speech Recognition: Looking Through a Philosophical Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems now mediate countless human-technology interactions, yet research on their fairness implications remains surprisingly limited. This paper examines ASR bias through a philosophical lens, arguing that systematic misrecognition of certain speech varieties constitutes more than a technical limitation -- it represents a form of disrespect that compounds historical injustices against marginalized linguistic communities. We distinguish between morally neutral classification (discriminate1) and harmful discrimination (discriminate2), demonstrating how ASR systems can inadvertently transform the former into the latter when they consistently misrecognize non-standard dialects. We identify three unique ethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from other algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of non-standard varieties ("temporal taxation"), the disruption of conversational flow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between speech patterns and personal/cultural identity. These factors create asymmetric power relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture. The paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism in ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce problematic language ideologies. We conclude that addressing ASR bias requires more than technical interventions; it demands recognition of diverse speech varieties as legitimate forms of expression worthy of technological accommodation. This philosophical reframing offers new pathways for developing ASR systems that respect linguistic diversity and speaker autonomy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While beam search improves speech recognition quality over greedy decoding, standard implementations are slow, often sequential, and CPU-bound. To fully leverage modern hardware capabilities, we present a novel open-source FlexCTC toolkit for fully GPU-based beam decoding, designed for Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) models. Developed entirely in Python and PyTorch, it offers a fast, user-friendly, and extensible alternative to traditional C++, CUDA, or WFST-based decoders. The toolkit features a high-performance, fully batched GPU implementation with eliminated CPU-GPU synchronization and minimized kernel launch overhead via CUDA Graphs. It also supports advanced contextualization techniques, including GPU-powered N-gram language model fusion and phrase-level boosting. These features enable accurate and efficient decoding, making them suitable for both research and production use.</description>

      <title>MIND: A Noise-Adaptive Denoising Framework for Medical Images Integrating Multi-Scale Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The core role of medical images in disease diagnosis makes their quality directly affect the accuracy of clinical judgment. However, due to factors such as low-dose scanning, equipment limitations and imaging artifacts, medical images are often accompanied by non-uniform noise interference, which seriously affects structure recognition and lesion detection. This paper proposes a medical image adaptive denoising model (MI-ND) that integrates multi-scale convolutional and Transformer architecture, introduces a noise level estimator (NLE) and a noise adaptive attention module (NAAB), and realizes channel-spatial attention regulation and cross-modal feature fusion driven by noise perception. Systematic testing is carried out on multimodal public datasets. Experiments show that this method significantly outperforms the comparative methods in image quality indicators such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, and improves the F1 score and ROC-AUC in downstream diagnostic tasks, showing strong prac-tical value and promotional potential. The model has outstanding benefits in structural recovery, diagnostic sensitivity, and cross-modal robustness, and provides an effective solution for medical image enhancement and AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>Beyond Ten Turns: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agentic Search with Large-Scale Asynchronous RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. &lt;=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.</description>

      <title>C-MAG: Cascade Multimodal Attributed Graphs for Supply Chain Link Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Workshop version accepted at KDD 2025 (AI4SupplyChain). Connecting an ever-expanding catalogue of products with suitable manufacturers and suppliers is critical for resilient, efficient global supply chains, yet traditional methods struggle to capture complex capabilities, certifications, geographic constraints, and rich multimodal data of real-world manufacturer profiles. To address these gaps, we introduce PMGraph, a public benchmark of bipartite and heterogeneous multimodal supply-chain graphs linking 8,888 manufacturers, over 70k products, more than 110k manufacturer-product edges, and over 29k product images. Building on this benchmark, we propose the Cascade Multimodal Attributed Graph C-MAG, a two-stage architecture that first aligns and aggregates textual and visual attributes into intermediate group embeddings, then propagates them through a manufacturer-product hetero-graph via multiscale message passing to enhance link prediction accuracy. C-MAG also provides practical guidelines for modality-aware fusion, preserving predictive performance in noisy, real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Capabilities of GPT-5 on Multimodal Medical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives, structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and understanding scores by +29.26% and +26.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain, recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of audio-visual foundation models underscores the importance of reliably assessing their multi-modal understanding. The VGGSound dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification. However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSound, including incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities. These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion metric.</description>

      <title>MLLM-CBench:A Comprehensive Benchmark for Continual Instruction Tuning of Multimodal LLMs with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require continual instruction tuning during their post-training phase to adapt to the dynamic real-world demands. However, the absence of rigorous and systematic benchmarks has hindered progress in this area. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MLLM-CTBench}, a dataset curating seven challenging tasks from six diverse domains with three contributions. First,to enable fine-grained analysis of continual learning ability, we introduce \textbf{multidimensional evaluation metrics}, which combines final answer accuracy with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning quality assessment through a carefully trained MLLM evaluator. Then, we conduct a \textbf{comprehensive evaluation of continual learning algorithms}, systematically assessing eight algorithms from four major categories to provide actionable insights for algorithm design and adoption. Finally ,we evaluate the efficacy of \textbf{Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) versus Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)} in maintaining model performance across sequential tasks during continual instruction tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that reasoning processes in MLLMs exhibit greater resilience than final outputs to forgetting during continual learning, aligning with cognitive theories of hierarchical forgetting. We further show that both model capability and task sequence significantly influence continual learning outcomes, with stronger baseline models exhibiting greater resistance to forgetting. Notably, properly regularized RFT emerges as a more robust approach than SFT for maintaining performance across tasks.One of the key contributing factors is KL-divergence regularization, without which RFT leads to even worse forgetting than SFT on old tasks though may perform better on new tasks.</description>

      <title>Yan: Foundational Interactive Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation, covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing. Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

      <title>Transferable Model-agnostic Vision-Language Model Adaptation for Efficient Weak-to-Strong Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance 'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained, this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain, often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Parallel Text Generation: From Parallel Decoding to Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However, most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency. Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for future research in parallel text generation. We have also created a GitHub repository for indexing relevant papers and open resources available at https://github.com/zhanglingzhe0820/Awesome-Parallel-Text-Generation.</description>

      <title>TempOpt -- Unsupervised Alarm Relation Learning for Telecommunication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time. Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency method.</description>

      <title>When Deepfakes Look Real: Detecting AI-Generated Faces with Unlabeled Data due to Annotation Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data. However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even \textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks. Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct, AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the increasing realism of deepfakes.</description>

      <title>SPARC: Soft Probabilistic Adaptive multi-interest Retrieval Model via Codebooks for recommender system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS. Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1) Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy, mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space. This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference, revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and practical value of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Text-Guided Color Editing with Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions. Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency. Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1 Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages, particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally, our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.</description>
