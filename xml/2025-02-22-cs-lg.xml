      <title>Beyond Single-Value Metrics: Evaluating and Enhancing LLM Unlearning with Cognitive Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the widespread use of LLMs and the rising critical ethical and safety concerns, LLM unlearning methods have been developed to remove harmful knowledge and undesirable capabilities. In this context, evaluations are mostly based on single-value metrics such as QA accuracy. However, these metrics often fail to capture the nuanced retention of harmful knowledge components, making it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of unlearning. To address this issue, we propose UNCD (UNlearning evaluation via Cognitive Diagnosis), a novel framework that leverages Cognitive Diagnosis Modeling for fine-grained evaluation of LLM unlearning. Our dedicated benchmark, UNCD-Cyber, provides a detailed assessment of the removal of dangerous capabilities. Moreover, we introduce UNCD-Agent, which refines unlearning by diagnosing knowledge remnants and generating targeted unlearning data. Extensive experiments across eight unlearning methods and two base models demonstrate that UNCD not only enhances evaluation but also effectively facilitates the removal of harmful LLM abilities.</description>

      <title>Rectified Lagrangian for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Modern Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Hopfield networks (MHNs) have recently gained significant attention in the field of artificial intelligence because they can store and retrieve a large set of patterns with an exponentially large memory capacity. A MHN is generally a dynamical system defined with Lagrangians of memory and feature neurons, where memories associated with in-distribution (ID) samples are represented by attractors in the feature space. One major problem in existing MHNs lies in managing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples because it was originally assumed that all samples are ID samples. To address this, we propose the rectified Lagrangian (RegLag), a new Lagrangian for memory neurons that explicitly incorporates an attractor for OOD samples in the dynamical system of MHNs. RecLag creates a trivial point attractor for any interaction matrix, enabling OOD detection by identifying samples that fall into this attractor as OOD. The interaction matrix is optimized so that the probability densities can be estimated to identify ID/OOD. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RecLag-based MHNs compared to energy-based OOD detection methods, including those using state-of-the-art Hopfield energies, across nine image datasets.</description>

      <title>Smaller But Better: Unifying Layout Generation with Smaller Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose LGGPT, an LLM-based model tailored for unified layout generation. First, we propose Arbitrary Layout Instruction (ALI) and Universal Layout Response (ULR) as the uniform I/O template. ALI accommodates arbitrary layout generation task inputs across multiple layout domains, enabling LGGPT to unify both task-generic and domain-generic layout generation hitherto unexplored. Collectively, ALI and ULR boast a succinct structure that forgoes superfluous tokens typically found in existing HTML-based formats, facilitating efficient instruction tuning and boosting unified generation performance. In addition, we propose an Interval Quantization Encoding (IQE) strategy that compresses ALI into a more condensed structure. IQE precisely preserves valid layout clues while eliminating the less informative placeholders, facilitating LGGPT to capture complex and variable layout generation conditions during the unified training process. Experimental results demonstrate that LGGPT achieves superior or on par performance compared to existing methods. Notably, LGGPT strikes a prominent balance between proficiency and efficiency with a compact 1.5B parameter LLM, which beats prior 7B or 175B models even in the most extensive and challenging unified scenario. Furthermore, we underscore the necessity of employing LLMs for unified layout generation and suggest that 1.5B could be an optimal parameter size by comparing LLMs of varying scales.

      <title>Which Attention Heads Matter for In-Context Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL) capability, enabling them to perform new tasks using only a few demonstrations in the prompt. Two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain ICL: induction heads that find and copy relevant tokens, and function vector (FV) heads whose activations compute a latent encoding of the ICL task. To better understand which of the two distinct mechanisms drives ICL, we study and compare induction heads and FV heads in 12 language models.
  Through detailed ablations, we discover that few-shot ICL performance depends primarily on FV heads, especially in larger models. In addition, we uncover that FV and induction heads are connected: many FV heads start as induction heads during training before transitioning to the FV mechanism. This leads us to speculate that induction facilitates learning the more complex FV mechanism that ultimately drives ICL.</description>

      <title>DFDT: Dynamic Fast Decision Tree for IoT Data Stream Mining on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things generates massive data streams, with edge computing emerging as a key enabler for online IoT applications and 5G networks. Edge solutions facilitate real-time machine learning inference, but also require continuous adaptation to concept drifts. Ensemble-based solutions improve predictive performance, but incur higher resource consumption, latency, and memory demands. This paper presents DFDT: Dynamic Fast Decision Tree, a novel algorithm designed for energy-efficient memory-constrained data stream mining. DFDT improves hoeffding tree growth efficiency by dynamically adjusting grace periods, tie thresholds, and split evaluations based on incoming data. It incorporates stricter evaluation rules (based on entropy, information gain, and leaf instance count), adaptive expansion modes, and a leaf deactivation mechanism to manage memory, allowing more computation on frequently visited nodes while conserving energy on others. Experiments show that the proposed framework can achieve increased predictive performance (0.43 vs 0.29 ranking) with constrained memory and a fraction of the runtime of VFDT or SVFDT.</description>

      <title>I Want 'Em All (At Once) -- Ultrametric Cluster Hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis, organizing data into a tree of clusterings from which a partition can be chosen. This paper generalizes these ideas by proving that, for any reasonable hierarchy, one can optimally solve any center-based clustering objective over it (such as $k$-means). Moreover, these solutions can be found exceedingly quickly and are themselves necessarily hierarchical. Thus, given a cluster tree, we show that one can quickly access a plethora of new, equally meaningful hierarchies. Just as in standard hierarchical clustering, one can then choose any desired partition from these new hierarchies. We conclude by verifying the utility of our proposed techniques across datasets, hierarchies, and partitioning schemes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Activation with Knowledge Distillation for Energy-Efficient Spiking NN Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While foundation AI models excel at tasks like classification and decision-making, their high energy consumption makes them unsuitable for energy-constrained applications. Inspired by the brain's efficiency, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a viable alternative due to their event-driven nature and compatibility with neuromorphic chips. This work introduces a novel system that combines knowledge distillation and ensemble learning to bridge the performance gap between artificial neural networks (ANNs) and SNNs. A foundation AI model acts as a teacher network, guiding smaller student SNNs organized into an ensemble, called Spiking Neural Ensemble (SNE). SNE enables the disentanglement of the teacher's knowledge, allowing each student to specialize in predicting a distinct aspect of it, while processing the same input. The core innovation of SNE is the adaptive activation of a subset of SNN models of an ensemble, leveraging knowledge-distillation, enhanced with an informed-partitioning (disentanglement) of the teacher's feature space. By dynamically activating only a subset of these student SNNs, the system balances accuracy and energy efficiency, achieving substantial energy savings with minimal accuracy loss. Moreover, SNE is significantly more efficient than the teacher network, reducing computational requirements by up to 20x with only a 2% drop in accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This disentanglement procedure achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 2.4% on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to other partitioning schemes. Finally, we comparatively analyze SNE performance under noisy conditions, demonstrating enhanced robustness compared to its ANN teacher. In summary, SNE offers a promising new direction for energy-constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Asking for Help Enables Safety Guarantees Without Sacrificing Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most reinforcement learning algorithms with regret guarantees rely on a critical assumption: that all errors are recoverable. Recent work by Plaut et al. discarded this assumption and presented algorithms that avoid "catastrophe" (i.e., irreparable errors) by asking for help. However, they provided only safety guarantees and did not consider reward maximization. We prove that any algorithm that avoids catastrophe in their setting also guarantees high reward (i.e., sublinear regret) in any Markov Decision Process (MDP), including MDPs with irreversible costs. This constitutes the first no-regret guarantee for general MDPs. More broadly, our result may be the first formal proof that it is possible for an agent to obtain high reward while becoming self-sufficient in an unknown, unbounded, and high-stakes environment without causing catastrophe or requiring resets.</description>

      <title>Position: There are no Champions in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in long-term time series forecasting have introduced numerous complex prediction models that consistently outperform previously published architectures. However, this rapid progression raises concerns regarding inconsistent benchmarking and reporting practices, which may undermine the reliability of these comparisons. Our position emphasizes the need to shift focus away from pursuing ever-more complex models and towards enhancing benchmarking practices through rigorous and standardized evaluation methods. To support our claim, we first perform a broad, thorough, and reproducible evaluation of the top-performing models on the most popular benchmark by training 3,500+ networks over 14 datasets. Then, through a comprehensive analysis, we find that slight changes to experimental setups or current evaluation metrics drastically shift the common belief that newly published results are advancing the state of the art. Our findings suggest the need for rigorous and standardized evaluation methods that enable more substantiated claims, including reproducible hyperparameter setups and statistical testing.</description>

      <title>Towards a Learning Theory of Representation Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that AI models' representations are becoming aligned as their scale and performance increase. Empirical analyses have been designed to support this idea and conjecture the possible alignment of different representations toward a shared statistical model of reality. In this paper, we propose a learning-theoretic perspective to representation alignment. First, we review and connect different notions of alignment based on metric, probabilistic, and spectral ideas. Then, we focus on stitching, a particular approach to understanding the interplay between different representations in the context of a task. Our main contribution here is relating properties of stitching to the kernel alignment of the underlying representation. Our results can be seen as a first step toward casting representation alignment as a learning-theoretic problem.</description>

      <title>Towards Vector Optimization on Low-Dimensional Vector Symbolic Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) is emerging in machine learning due to its efficiency, but they are hindered by issues of hyperdimensionality and accuracy. As a promising mitigation, the Low-Dimensional Computing (LDC) method significantly reduces the vector dimension by ~100 times while maintaining accuracy, by employing a gradient-based optimization. Despite its potential, LDC optimization for VSA is still underexplored. Our investigation into vector updates underscores the importance of stable, adaptive dynamics in LDC training. We also reveal the overlooked yet critical roles of batch normalization (BN) and knowledge distillation (KD) in standard approaches. Besides the accuracy boost, BN does not add computational overhead during inference, and KD significantly enhances inference confidence. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across multiple benchmarks, we provide a thorough evaluation of our approach and extend the interpretability of binary neural network optimization similar to LDC, previously unaddressed in BNN literature.</description>

      <title>Learning from End User Data with Shuffled Differential Privacy over Kernel Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a setting of collecting and learning from private data distributed across end users. In the shuffled model of differential privacy, the end users partially protect their data locally before sharing it, and their data is also anonymized during its collection to enhance privacy. This model has recently become a prominent alternative to central DP, which requires full trust in a central data curator, and local DP, where fully local data protection takes a steep toll on downstream accuracy.
  Our main technical result is a shuffled DP protocol for privately estimating the kernel density function of a distributed dataset, with accuracy essentially matching central DP. We use it to privately learn a classifier from the end user data, by learning a private density function per class. Moreover, we show that the density function itself can recover the semantic content of its class, despite having been learned in the absence of any unprotected data. Our experiments show the favorable downstream performance of our approach, and highlight key downstream considerations and trade-offs in a practical ML deployment of shuffled DP.</description>

      <title>Aligned Multi Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, the multi-objective optimization literature has mainly focused on conflicting objectives, studying the Pareto front, or requiring users to balance tradeoffs. Yet, in machine learning practice, there are many scenarios where such conflict does not take place. Recent findings from multi-task learning, reinforcement learning, and LLMs training show that diverse related tasks can enhance performance across objectives simultaneously. Despite this evidence, such phenomenon has not been examined from an optimization perspective. This leads to a lack of generic gradient-based methods that can scale to scenarios with a large number of related objectives. To address this gap, we introduce the Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization framework, propose new algorithms for this setting, and provide theoretical guarantees of their superior performance compared to naive approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine sufficient conditions for overparametrized deep learning (DL) networks to guarantee the attainability of zero loss in the context of supervised learning, for the $\mathcal{L}^2$ cost and {\em generic} training data. We present an explicit construction of the zero loss minimizers without invoking gradient descent. On the other hand, we point out that increase of depth can deteriorate the efficiency of cost minimization using a gradient descent algorithm by analyzing the conditions for rank loss of the training Jacobian. Our results clarify key aspects on the dichotomy between zero loss reachability in underparametrized versus overparametrized DL.</description>

      <title>Chasing the Timber Trail: Machine Learning to Reveal Harvest Location Misrepresentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Illegal logging poses a significant threat to global biodiversity, climate stability, and depresses international prices for legal wood harvesting and responsible forest products trade, affecting livelihoods and communities across the globe. Stable isotope ratio analysis (SIRA) is rapidly becoming an important tool for determining the harvest location of traded, organic, products. The spatial pattern in stable isotope ratio values depends on factors such as atmospheric and environmental conditions and can thus be used for geographical identification. We present here the results of a deployed machine learning pipeline where we leverage both isotope values and atmospheric variables to determine timber harvest location. Additionally, the pipeline incorporates uncertainty estimation to facilitate the interpretation of harvest location determination for analysts. We present our experiments on a collection of oak (Quercus spp.) tree samples from its global range. Our pipeline outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models determining geographic harvest origin of commercially traded wood products, and has been used by European enforcement agencies to identify illicit Russian and Belarusian timber entering the EU market. We also identify opportunities for further advancement of our framework and how it can be generalized to help identify the origin of falsely labeled organic products throughout the supply chain.</description>

      <title>A Supervised Machine-Learning Approach For Turboshaft Engine Dynamic Modeling Under Real Flight Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotorcraft engines are highly complex, nonlinear thermodynamic systems that operate under varying environmental and flight conditions. Simulating their dynamics is crucial for design, fault diagnostics, and deterioration control phases, and requires robust and reliable control systems to estimate engine performance throughout flight envelope. However, the development of detailed physical models of the engine based on numerical simulations is a very challenging task due to the complex and entangled physics driving the engine. In this scenario, data-driven machine-learning techniques are of great interest to the aircraft engine community, due to their ability to describe nonlinear systems' dynamic behavior and enable online performance estimation, achieving excellent results with accuracy competitive with the state of the art. In this work, we explore different Neural Network architectures to model the turboshaft engine of Leonardo's AW189P4 prototype, aiming to predict the engine torque. The models are trained on an extensive database of real flight tests featuring a variety of operational maneuvers performed under different flight conditions, providing a comprehensive representation of the engine's performance. To complement the neural network approach, we apply Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to derive a low-dimensional dynamical model from the available data, describing the relationship between fuel flow and engine torque. The resulting model showcases SINDy's capability to recover the actual physics underlying the engine dynamics and demonstrates its potential for investigating more complex aspects of the engine. The results prove that data-driven engine models can exploit a wider range of parameters than standard transfer function-based approaches, enabling the use of trained schemes to simulate nonlinear effects in different engines and helicopters.</description>

      <title>Understanding SGD with Exponential Moving Average: A Case Study in Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponential moving average (EMA) has recently gained significant popularity in training modern deep learning models, especially diffusion-based generative models. However, there have been few theoretical results explaining the effectiveness of EMA. In this paper, to better understand EMA, we establish the risk bound of online SGD with EMA for high-dimensional linear regression, one of the simplest overparameterized learning tasks that shares similarities with neural networks. Our results indicate that (i) the variance error of SGD with EMA is always smaller than that of SGD without averaging, and (ii) unlike SGD with iterate averaging from the beginning, the bias error of SGD with EMA decays exponentially in every eigen-subspace of the data covariance matrix. Additionally, we develop proof techniques applicable to the analysis of a broad class of averaging schemes.</description>

      <title>Gradients can train reward models: An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <title>Cluster Analysis and Concept Drift Detection in Malware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept drift refers to gradual or sudden changes in the properties of data that affect the accuracy of machine learning models. In this paper, we address the problem of concept drift detection in the malware domain. Specifically, we propose and analyze a clustering-based approach to detecting concept drift. Using a subset of the KronoDroid dataset, malware samples are partitioned into temporal batches and analyzed using MiniBatch $K$-Means clustering. The silhouette coefficient is used as a metric to identify points in time where concept drift has likely occurred. To verify our drift detection results, we train learning models under three realistic scenarios, which we refer to as static training, periodic retraining, and drift-aware retraining. In each scenario, we consider four supervised classifiers, namely, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost. Experimental results demonstrate that drift-aware retraining guided by silhouette coefficient thresholding achieves classification accuracy far superior to static models, and generally within 1% of periodic retraining, while also being far more efficient than periodic retraining. These results provide strong evidence that our clustering-based approach is effective at detecting concept drift, while also illustrating a highly practical and efficient fully automated approach to improved malware classification via concept drift detection.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Optimal Policy Gradient Algorithm for Corrupted Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the stochastic multi-armed bandits problem with adversarial corruptions, where the random rewards of the arms are partially modified by an adversary to fool the algorithm. We apply the policy gradient algorithm SAMBA to this setting, and show that it is computationally efficient, and achieves a state-of-the-art $O(K\log T/\Delta) + O(C/\Delta)$ regret upper bound, where $K$ is the number of arms, $C$ is the unknown corruption level, $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between the best arm and other ones, and $T$ is the time horizon. Compared with the best existing efficient algorithm (e.g., CBARBAR), whose regret upper bound is $O(K\log^2 T/\Delta) + O(C)$, we show that SAMBA reduces one $\log T$ factor in the regret bound, while maintaining the corruption-dependent term to be linear with $C$. This is indeed asymptotically optimal. We also conduct simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of SAMBA, and the results show that SAMBA outperforms existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning the P2D Model for Lithium-Ion Batteries with SOH Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium ion batteries are widely used in many applications. Battery management systems control their optimal use and charging and predict when the battery will cease to deliver the required output on a planned duty or driving cycle. Such systems use a simulation of a mathematical model of battery performance. These models can be electrochemical or data-driven. Electrochemical models for batteries running at high currents are mathematically and computationally complex. In this work, we show that a well-regarded electrochemical model, the Pseudo Two Dimensional (P2D) model, can be replaced by a computationally efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) surrogate model fit to accurately simulated data from a class of random driving cycles. We demonstrate that a CNN is an ideal choice for accurately capturing Lithium ion concentration profiles. Additionally, we show how the neural network model can be adjusted to correspond to battery changes in State of Health (SOH).</description>

      <title>Dual-level Mixup for Graph Few-shot Learning with Fewer Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for effectively learning graph-structured data on the web and mining content from it.Current leading graph models require a large number of labeled samples for training, which unavoidably leads to overfitting in few-shot scenarios. Recent research has sought to alleviate this issue by simultaneously leveraging graph learning and meta-learning paradigms. However, these graph meta-learning models assume the availability of numerous meta-training tasks to learn transferable meta-knowledge. Such assumption may not be feasible in the real world due to the difficulty of constructing tasks and the substantial costs involved. Therefore, we propose a SiMple yet effectIve approach for graph few-shot Learning with fEwer tasks, named SMILE. We introduce a dual-level mixup strategy, encompassing both within-task and across-task mixup, to simultaneously enrich the available nodes and tasks in meta-learning. Moreover, we explicitly leverage the prior information provided by the node degrees in the graph to encode expressive node representations. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SMILE can enhance the model generalization ability. Empirically, SMILE consistently outperforms other competitive models by a large margin across all evaluated datasets with in-domain and cross-domain settings. Our anonymous code can be found here.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-based Framework for Scalable and Incentivized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, preserving privacy while harnessing distributed datasets. However, traditional FL systems often rely on centralized aggregating mechanisms, introducing trust issues, single points of failure, and limited mechanisms for incentivizing meaningful client contributions. These challenges are exacerbated as FL scales to train resource-intensive models, such as large language models (LLMs), requiring scalable, decentralized solutions. This paper presents a blockchain-based FL framework that addresses these limitations by integrating smart contracts and a novel hybrid incentive mechanism. The framework automates critical FL tasks, including client registration, update validation, reward distribution, and maintaining a transparent global state. The hybrid incentive mechanism combines on-chain alignment-based rewards, off-chain fairness checks, and consistency multipliers to ensure fairness, transparency, and sustained engagement. We evaluate the framework through gas cost analysis, demonstrating its feasibility for different scales of federated learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>InstaSHAP: Interpretable Additive Models Explain Shapley Values Instantly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the Shapley value and SHAP explanations have emerged as one of the most dominant paradigms for providing post-hoc explanations of black-box models. Despite their well-founded theoretical properties, many recent works have focused on the limitations in both their computational efficiency and their representation power. The underlying connection with additive models, however, is left critically under-emphasized in the current literature. In this work, we find that a variational perspective linking GAM models and SHAP explanations is able to provide deep insights into nearly all recent developments. In light of this connection, we borrow in the other direction to develop a new method to train interpretable GAM models which are automatically purified to compute the Shapley value in a single forward pass. Finally, we provide theoretical results showing the limited representation power of GAM models is the same Achilles' heel existing in SHAP and discuss the implications for SHAP's modern usage in CV and NLP.</description>

      <title>On the logical skills of large language models: evaluations using arbitrarily complex first-order logic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method of generating first-order logic statements whose complexity can be controlled along multiple dimensions. We use this method to automatically create several datasets consisting of questions asking for the truth or falsity of first-order logic statements in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. While the resolution of these questions does not require any knowledge beyond basic notation of first-order logic and set theory, it does require a degree of planning and logical reasoning, which can be controlled up to arbitrarily high difficulty by the complexity of the generated statements. Furthermore, we do extensive evaluations of the performance of various large language models, including recent models such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini, on these datasets. All of the datasets along with the code used for generating them, as well as all data from the evaluations is publicly available at https://github.com/bkuckuck/logical-skills-of-llms.</description>

      <title>Type 1 Diabetes Management using GLIMMER: Glucose Level Indicator Model with Modified Error Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) demands constant vigilance as individuals strive to regulate their blood glucose levels to avert the dangers of dysglycemia (hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia). Despite the advent of sophisticated technologies such as automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, achieving optimal glycemic control remains a formidable task. AID systems integrate continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitors (CGM) data, offering promise in reducing variability and increasing glucose time-in-range. However, these systems often fail to prevent dysglycemia, partly due to limitations in prediction algorithms that lack the precision to avert abnormal glucose events. This gap highlights the need for proactive behavioral adjustments. We address this need with GLIMMER, Glucose Level Indicator Model with Modified Error Rate, a machine learning approach for forecasting blood glucose levels. GLIMMER categorizes glucose values into normal and abnormal ranges and devises a novel custom loss function to prioritize accuracy in dysglycemic events where patient safety is critical. To evaluate the potential of GLIMMER for T1D management, we both use a publicly available dataset and collect new data involving 25 patients with T1D. In predicting next-hour glucose values, GLIMMER achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.97 (+/-3.77) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 15.83 (+/-2.09) mg/dL. These results reflect a 23% improvement in RMSE and a 31% improvement in MAE compared to the best-reported error rates.</description>

      <title>Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models: Kahneman-Tversky vs. Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) as a fine-tuning method for large language models (LLMs) in federated learning (FL) settings, comparing it against Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Using Alpaca-7B as the base model, we fine-tune on a realistic dataset under both methods and evaluate performance using MT-Bench-1, Vicuna, and AdvBench benchmarks. Additionally, we introduce a redistributed dataset setup, where only KTO is applicable due to its ability to handle single-response feedback, unlike DPO's reliance on paired responses. Our results demonstrate that KTO, in both its original (KTOO) and redistributed (KTOR) configurations, consistently outperforms DPO across all benchmarks. In the redistributed setup, KTO further validates its flexibility and resilience by maintaining superior performance in scenarios where DPO cannot be applied. These findings establish KTO as a robust and scalable fine-tuning method for FL, motivating its adoption for privacy-preserving, decentralized, and heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Sparsified Graph Learning Framework for Vessel Behavior Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for learning spatiotemporal interactions. However, conventional approaches often rely on predefined graphs, which may obscure the precise relationships being modeled. Additionally, existing methods typically define nodes based on fixed spatial locations, a strategy that is ill-suited for dynamic environments like maritime environments. Our method introduces an innovative graph representation where timestamps are modeled as distinct nodes, allowing temporal dependencies to be explicitly captured through graph edges. This setup is extended to construct a multi-ship graph that effectively captures spatial interactions while preserving graph sparsity. The graph is processed using Graph Convolutional Network layers to capture spatiotemporal patterns, with a forecasting layer for feature prediction and a Variational Graph Autoencoder for reconstruction, enabling robust anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Accurate Forgetting for Heterogeneous Federated Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a burgeoning interest in federated learning (FL). However, the contexts in which clients engage in sequential learning remain under-explored. Bridging FL and continual learning (CL) gives rise to a challenging practical problem: federated continual learning (FCL). Existing research in FCL primarily focuses on mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue of continual learning while collaborating with other clients. We argue that the forgetting phenomena are not invariably detrimental. In this paper, we consider a more practical and challenging FCL setting characterized by potentially unrelated or even antagonistic data/tasks across different clients. In the FL scenario, statistical heterogeneity and data noise among clients may exhibit spurious correlations which result in biased feature learning. While existing CL strategies focus on a complete utilization of previous knowledge, we found that forgetting biased information is beneficial in our study. Therefore, we propose a new concept accurate forgetting (AF) and develop a novel generative-replay method~\method~which selectively utilizes previous knowledge in federated networks. We employ a probabilistic framework based on a normalizing flow model to quantify the credibility of previous knowledge. Comprehensive experiments affirm the superiority of our method over baselines.</description>

      <title>A Non-Asymptotic Theory of Seminorm Lyapunov Stability: From Deterministic to Stochastic Iterative Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of solving fixed-point equations for seminorm-contractive operators and establish foundational results on the non-asymptotic behavior of iterative algorithms in both deterministic and stochastic settings. Specifically, in the deterministic setting, we prove a fixed-point theorem for seminorm-contractive operators, showing that iterates converge geometrically to the kernel of the seminorm. In the stochastic setting, we analyze the corresponding stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm under seminorm-contractive operators and Markovian noise, providing a finite-sample analysis for various stepsize choices.
  A benchmark for equation solving is linear systems of equations, where the convergence behavior of fixed-point iteration is closely tied to the stability of linear dynamical systems. In this special case, our results provide a complete characterization of system stability with respect to a seminorm, linking it to the solution of a Lyapunov equation in terms of positive semi-definite matrices. In the stochastic setting, we establish a finite-sample analysis for linear Markovian SA without requiring the Hurwitzness assumption.
  Our theoretical results offer a unified framework for deriving finite-sample bounds for various reinforcement learning algorithms in the average reward setting, including TD($\lambda$) for policy evaluation (which is a special case of solving a Poisson equation) and Q-learning for control.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Co-Training for Source-Free Few-Shot Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) has gained significant attention as an alternative to traditional unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which relies on the constant availability of labeled source data. However, SFUDA approaches come with inherent limitations that are frequently overlooked. These challenges include performance degradation when the unlabeled target data fails to meet critical assumptions, such as having a closed-set label distribution identical to that of the source domain, or when sufficient unlabeled target data is unavailable-a common situation in real-world applications. To address these issues, we propose an asymmetric co-training (ACT) method specifically designed for the SFFSDA scenario. SFFSDA presents a more practical alternative to SFUDA, as gathering a few labeled target instances is more feasible than acquiring large volumes of unlabeled target data in many real-world contexts. Our ACT method begins by employing a weak-strong augmentation to enhance data diversity. Then we use a two-step optimization process to train the target model. In the first step, we optimize the label smoothing cross-entropy loss, the entropy of the class-conditional distribution, and the reverse-entropy loss to bolster the model's discriminative ability while mitigating overfitting. The second step focuses on reducing redundancy in the output space by minimizing classifier determinacy disparity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ACT approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art SFUDA methods and transfer learning techniques. Our findings suggest that adapting a source pre-trained model using only a small amount of labeled target data offers a practical and dependable solution.

      <title>Rethinking Spiking Neural Networks from an Ensemble Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit superior energy efficiency but suffer from limited performance. In this paper, we consider SNNs as ensembles of temporal subnetworks that share architectures and weights, and highlight a crucial issue that affects their performance: excessive differences in initial states (neuronal membrane potentials) across timesteps lead to unstable subnetwork outputs, resulting in degraded performance. To mitigate this, we promote the consistency of the initial membrane potential distribution and output through membrane potential smoothing and temporally adjacent subnetwork guidance, respectively, to improve overall stability and performance. Moreover, membrane potential smoothing facilitates forward propagation of information and backward propagation of gradients, mitigating the notorious temporal gradient vanishing problem. Our method requires only minimal modification of the spiking neurons without adapting the network structure, making our method generalizable and showing consistent performance gains in 1D speech, 2D object, and 3D point cloud recognition tasks. In particular, on the challenging CIFAR10-DVS dataset, we achieved 83.20\% accuracy with only four timesteps. This provides valuable insights into unleashing the potential of SNNs.</description>

      <title>SleepGMUformer: A gated multimodal temporal neural network for sleep staging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep staging is a key method for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, current deep learning methods face challenges: 1) postfusion techniques ignore the varying contributions of different modalities; 2) unprocessed sleep data can interfere with frequency-domain information. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a gated multimodal temporal neural network for multidomain sleep data, including heart rate, motion, steps, EEG (Fpz-Cz, Pz-Oz), and EOG from WristHR-Motion-Sleep and SleepEDF-78. The model integrates: 1) a pre-processing module for feature alignment, missing value handling, and EEG de-trending; 2) a feature extraction module for complex sleep features in the time dimension; and 3) a dynamic fusion module for real-time modality weighting.Experiments show classification accuracies of 85.03% on SleepEDF-78 and 94.54% on WristHR-Motion-Sleep datasets. The model handles heterogeneous datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art models by 1.00%-4.00%.</description>

      <title>LabTOP: A Unified Model for Lab Test Outcome Prediction on Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lab tests are fundamental for diagnosing diseases and monitoring patient conditions. However, frequent testing can be burdensome for patients, and test results may not always be immediately available. To address these challenges, we propose LabTOP, a unified model that predicts lab test outcomes by leveraging a language modeling approach on EHR data. Unlike conventional methods that estimate only a subset of lab tests or classify discrete value ranges, LabTOP performs continuous numerical predictions for a diverse range of lab items. We evaluate LabTOP on three publicly available EHR datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods, including traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of our design choices. We believe that LabTOP will serve as an accurate and generalizable framework for lab test outcome prediction, with potential applications in clinical decision support and early detection of critical conditions.</description>

      <title>Predicting Fetal Birthweight from High Dimensional Data using Advanced Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Birth weight serves as a fundamental indicator of neonatal health, closely linked to both early medical interventions and long-term developmental risks. Traditional predictive models, often constrained by limited feature selection and incomplete datasets, struggle to achieve overlooking complex maternal and fetal interactions in diverse clinical settings. This research explores machine learning to address these limitations, utilizing a structured methodology that integrates advanced imputation strategies, supervised feature selection techniques, and predictive modeling. Given the constraints of the dataset, the research strengthens the role of data preprocessing in improving the model performance. Among the various methodologies explored, tree-based feature selection methods demonstrated superior capability in identifying the most relevant predictors, while ensemble-based regression models proved highly effective in capturing non-linear relationships and complex maternal-fetal interactions within the data. Beyond model performance, the study highlights the clinical significance of key physiological determinants, offering insights into maternal and fetal health factors that influence birth weight, offering insights that extend over statistical modeling. By bridging computational intelligence with perinatal research, this work underscores the transformative role of machine learning in enhancing predictive accuracy, refining risk assessment and informing data-driven decision-making in maternal and neonatal care.

      <title>STeCa: Step-level Trajectory Calibration for LLM Agent Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in tackling complex tasks by interacting dynamically with the environment. Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations and preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle in long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. These calibrated trajectories, together with successful trajectory data, are utilized for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that step-level calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/STeCa.</description>

      <title>Correcting Noisy Multilabel Predictions: Modeling Label Noise through Latent Space Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise in data appears to be inevitable in most real-world machine learning applications and would cause severe overfitting problems. Not only can data features contain noise, but labels are also prone to be noisy due to human input. In this paper, rather than noisy label learning in multiclass classifications, we instead focus on the less explored area of noisy label learning for multilabel classifications. Specifically, we investigate the post-correction of predictions generated from classifiers learned with noisy labels. The reasons are two-fold. Firstly, this approach can directly work with the trained models to save computational resources. Secondly, it could be applied on top of other noisy label correction techniques to achieve further improvements. To handle this problem, we appeal to deep generative approaches that are possible for uncertainty estimation. Our model posits that label noise arises from a stochastic shift in the latent variable, providing a more robust and beneficial means for noisy learning. We develop both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods for our model. The extensive empirical study presents solid evidence to that our approach is able to consistently improve the independent models and performs better than a number of existing methods across various noisy label settings. Moreover, a comprehensive empirical analysis of the proposed method is carried out to validate its robustness, including sensitivity analysis and an ablation study, among other elements.</description>

      <title>Graph Anomaly Detection via Adaptive Test-time Representation Learning across Out-of-Distribution Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) has demonstrated great effectiveness in identifying unusual patterns within graph-structured data. However, while labeled anomalies are often scarce in emerging applications, existing supervised GAD approaches are either ineffective or not applicable when moved across graph domains due to distribution shifts and heterogeneous feature spaces. To address these challenges, we present AdaGraph-T3, a novel test-time training framework for cross-domain GAD. AdaGraph-T3 combines supervised and self-supervised learning during training while adapting to a new domain during test time using only self-supervised learning by leveraging a homophily-based affinity score that captures domain-invariant properties of anomalies. Our framework introduces four key innovations to cross-domain GAD: an effective self-supervision scheme, an attention-based mechanism that dynamically learns edge importance weights during message passing, domain-specific encoders for handling heterogeneous features, and class-aware regularization to address imbalance. Experiments across multiple cross-domain settings demonstrate that AdaGraph-T3 significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving average improvements of over 6.6% in AUROC and 7.9% in AUPRC compared to the best competing model.</description>

      <title>Generalization Certificates for Adversarially Robust Bayesian Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness of machine learning models is critical to ensuring reliable performance under data perturbations. Recent progress has been on point estimators, and this paper considers distributional predictors. First, using the link between exponential families and Bregman divergences, we formulate an adversarial Bregman divergence loss as an adversarial negative log-likelihood. Using the geometric properties of Bregman divergences, we compute the adversarial perturbation for such models in closed-form. Second, under such losses, we introduce \emph{adversarially robust posteriors}, by exploiting the optimization-centric view of generalized Bayesian inference. Third, we derive the \emph{first} rigorous generalization certificates in the context of an adversarial extension of Bayesian linear regression by leveraging the PAC-Bayesian framework. Finally, experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior robustness of the derived adversarially robust posterior over Bayes posterior, and also validate our theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>On Theoretical Limits of Learning with Label Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label differential privacy (DP) is designed for learning problems involving private labels and public features. While various methods have been proposed for learning under label DP, the theoretical limits remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits of learning with label DP in both local and central models for both classification and regression tasks, characterized by minimax convergence rates. We establish lower bounds by converting each task into a multiple hypothesis testing problem and bounding the test error. Additionally, we develop algorithms that yield matching upper bounds. Our results demonstrate that under label local DP (LDP), the risk has a significantly faster convergence rate than that under full LDP, i.e. protecting both features and labels, indicating the advantages of relaxing the DP definition to focus solely on labels. In contrast, under the label central DP (CDP), the risk is only reduced by a constant factor compared to full DP, indicating that the relaxation of CDP only has limited benefits on the performance.</description>

      <title>Self-Improvement Towards Pareto Optimality: Mitigating Preference Conflicts in Multi-Objective Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Objective Alignment (MOA) aims to align LLMs' responses with multiple human preference objectives, with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) emerging as a prominent approach. However, we find that DPO-based MOA approaches suffer from widespread preference conflicts in the data, where different objectives favor different responses. This results in conflicting optimization directions, hindering the optimization on the Pareto Front. To address this, we propose to construct Pareto-optimal responses to resolve preference conflicts. To efficiently obtain and utilize such responses, we propose a self-improving DPO framework that enables LLMs to self-generate and select Pareto-optimal responses for self-supervised preference alignment. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the superior Pareto Front achieved by our framework compared to various baselines.

      <description>arXiv:2502.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the instability of Q-learning in continuous environments, a challenge frequently encountered by practitioners. Traditionally, this instability is attributed to bootstrapping and regression model errors. Using a representative reinforcement learning benchmark, we systematically examine the effects of bootstrapping and model inaccuracies by incrementally eliminating these potential error sources. Our findings reveal that even in relatively simple benchmarks, the fundamental task of Q-learning - iteratively learning a Q-function from policy-specific target values - can be inherently ill-posed and prone to failure. These insights cast doubt on the reliability of Q-learning as a universal solution for reinforcement learning problems.</description>

      <title>PPO-MI: Efficient Black-Box Model Inversion via Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy risk by attempting to reconstruct private training data from trained models. Most of the existing methods either depend on gradient estimation or require white-box access to model parameters, which limits their applicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose PPO-MI, a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for black-box model inversion attacks. Our approach formulates the inversion task as a Markov Decision Process, where an agent navigates the latent space of a generative model to reconstruct private training samples using only model predictions. By employing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a momentum-based state transition mechanism, along with a reward function balancing prediction accuracy and exploration, PPO-MI ensures efficient latent space exploration and high query efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments illustrates that PPO-MI outperforms the existing methods while require less attack knowledge, and it is robust across various model architectures and datasets. These results underline its effectiveness and generalizability in practical black-box scenarios, raising important considerations for the privacy vulnerabilities of deployed machine learning models.</description>

      <title>VFL-RPS: Relevant Participant Selection in Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaboration between different parties, while ensuring that the data across these parties is not shared. However, not every collaboration is helpful in terms of the resulting model performance. Therefore, it is an important challenge to select the correct participants in a collaboration. As it currently stands, most of the efforts in participant selection in the literature have focused on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), which assumes that all features are the same across all participants, disregarding the possibility of different features across participants which is captured in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). To close this gap in the literature, we propose a novel method VFL-RPS for participant selection in VFL, as a pre-training step. We have tested our method on several data sets performing both regression and classification tasks, showing that our method leads to comparable results as using all data by only selecting a few participants. In addition, we show that our method outperforms existing methods for participant selection in VFL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) with reward distributions belonging to a One-Parameter Exponential Distribution (OPED) family. In the literature, several criteria have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such algorithms, including Asymptotic Optimality (A.O.), Minimax Optimality (M.O.), Sub-UCB, and variance-adaptive worst-case regret bound. Thompson Sampling (TS)-based and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-based algorithms have been employed to achieve some of these criteria. However, none of these algorithms simultaneously satisfy all the aforementioned criteria.
  In this paper, we design an algorithm, Exponential Kullback-Leibler Maillard Sampling (abbrev. \expklms), that can achieve multiple optimality criteria simultaneously, including A.O., M.O. with a logarithmic factor, Sub-UCB, and variance-adaptive worst-case regret bound.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: dtaianomaly is an open-source Python library for time series anomaly detection, designed to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications. Our goal is to (1) accelerate the development of novel state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques through simple extensibility; (2) offer functionality for large-scale experimental validation; and thereby (3) bring cutting-edge research to business and industry through a standardized API, similar to scikit-learn to lower the entry barrier for both new and experienced users. Besides these key features, dtaianomaly offers (1) a broad range of built-in anomaly detectors, (2) support for time series preprocessing, (3) tools for visual analysis, (4) confidence prediction of anomaly scores, (5) runtime and memory profiling, (6) comprehensive documentation, and (7) cross-platform unit testing.
  The source code of dtaianomaly, documentation, code examples and installation guides are publicly available at https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/dtaianomaly.</description>

      <title>S*: Test Time Scaling for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing test-time compute for LLMs shows promise across domains but remains underexplored in code generation, despite extensive study in math. In this paper, we propose S*, the first hybrid test-time scaling framework that substantially improves the coverage and selection accuracy of generated code. S* extends the existing parallel scaling paradigm with sequential scaling to push performance boundaries. It further leverages a novel selection mechanism that adaptively generates distinguishing inputs for pairwise comparison, combined with execution-grounded information to robustly identify correct solutions. We evaluate across 12 Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Model and show: (1) S* consistently improves performance across model families and sizes, enabling a 3B model to outperform GPT-4o-mini; (2) S* enables non-reasoning models to surpass reasoning models - GPT-4o-mini with S* outperforms o1-preview by 3.7% on LiveCodeBench; (3) S* further boosts state-of-the-art reasoning models - DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B with S* achieves 85.7% on LiveCodeBench, approaching o1 (high) at 88.5%. Code will be available under https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Automatic Self-Pruning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite exceptional capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) still face deployment challenges due to their enormous size. Post-training structured pruning is a promising solution that prunes LLMs without the need for retraining, reducing computational overhead, and it is hardware-deployment friendly. However, the training-free nature of post-training structured pruning leads to significant performance degradation. We argue that the key to mitigating this issue lies in accurately determining the pruning rate for each layer. Meanwhile, we find that LLMs may have prior knowledge about their own redundancy. Based on this insight, we introduce $\textbf{Self-Pruner}$ an end-to-end automatic self-pruning framework for LLMs, which efficiently search layer-wise pruning rates. Specifically, $\textbf{Self-Pruner}$ leverages LLMs to autonomously execute the entire evolutionary search process to search for pruning rate configurations. In this process, LLMs are used to generate populations, select parent solutions from the current population, and perform crossover and mutation operations to produce offspring solutions. In this way, LLMs automatically generate and evaluate a large number of candidate solutions, effectively converging to find the pruning rate configurations with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate $\textbf{Self-Pruner}$'s better performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, $\textbf{Self-Pruner}$ prunes LLaMA-2-70B to 49B level with only 0.80$\%$ drop in accuracy across seven commonsense reasoning tasks, achieving a 1.39$\times$ speedup on NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU. Further pruning to 35B level resulted in only a 3.80$\%$ decrease in accuracy while obtaining a 1.70$\times$ speedup.</description>

      <title>Cardiac Evidence Backtracking for Eating Behavior Monitoring using Collocative Electrocardiogram Imagining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eating monitoring has remained an open challenge in medical research for years due to the lack of non-invasive sensors for continuous monitoring and the reliable methods for automatic behavior detection. In this paper, we present a pilot study using the wearable 24-hour ECG for sensing and tailoring the sophisticated deep learning for ad-hoc and interpretable detection. This is accomplished using a collocative learning framework in which 1) we construct collocative tensors as pseudo-images from 1D ECG signals to improve the feasibility of 2D image-based deep models; 2) we formulate the cardiac logic of analyzing the ECG data in a comparative way as periodic attention regulators so as to guide the deep inference to collect evidence in a human comprehensible manner; and 3) we improve the interpretability of the framework by enabling the backtracking of evidence with a set of methods designed for Class Activation Mapping (CAM) decoding and decision tree/forest generation. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been validated on the largest ECG dataset of eating behavior with superior performance over conventional models, and its capacity of cardiac evidence mining has also been verified through the consistency of the evidence it backtracked and that of the previous medical studies.</description>

      <title>Port-Hamiltonian Neural Networks with Output Error Noise Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian neural networks (HNNs) represent a promising class of physics-informed deep learning methods that utilize Hamiltonian theory as foundational knowledge within neural networks. However, their direct application to engineering systems is often challenged by practical issues, including the presence of external inputs, dissipation, and noisy measurements. This paper introduces a novel framework that enhances the capabilities of HNNs to address these real-life factors. We integrate port-Hamiltonian theory into the neural network structure, allowing for the inclusion of external inputs and dissipation, while mitigating the impact of measurement noise through an output-error (OE) model structure. The resulting output error port-Hamiltonian neural networks (OE-pHNNs) can be adapted to tackle modeling complex engineering systems with noisy measurements. Furthermore, we propose the identification of OE-pHNNs based on the subspace encoder approach (SUBNET), which efficiently approximates the complete simulation loss using subsections of the data and uses an encoder function to predict initial states. By integrating SUBNET with OE-pHNNs, we achieve consistent models of complex engineering systems under noisy measurements. In addition, we perform a consistency analysis to ensure the reliability of the proposed data-driven model learning method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on system identification benchmarks, showing its potential as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic systems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Llamba: Scaling Distilled Recurrent Models for Efficient Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Llamba, a family of efficient recurrent language models distilled from Llama-3.x into the Mamba architecture. The series includes Llamba-1B, Llamba-3B, and Llamba-8B, which achieve higher inference throughput and handle significantly larger batch sizes than Transformer-based models while maintaining comparable benchmark performance. Furthermore, Llamba demonstrates the effectiveness of cross-architecture distillation using MOHAWK (Bick et al., 2024), achieving these results with less than 0.1% of the training data typically used for models of similar size. To take full advantage of their efficiency, we provide an optimized implementation of Llamba for resource-constrained devices such as smartphones and edge platforms, offering a practical and memory-efficient alternative to Transformers. Overall, Llamba improves the tradeoff between speed, memory efficiency, and performance, making high-quality language models more accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a more energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by mimicking biological neural principles, establishing them as a promising approach to mitigate the increasing energy demands of large-scale neural models. However, fully harnessing the capabilities of SNNs remains challenging due to their discrete signal processing and temporal dynamics. ANN-SNN conversion has emerged as a practical approach, enabling SNNs to achieve competitive performance on complex machine learning tasks. In this work, we identify a phenomenon in the ANN-SNN conversion framework, termed temporal misalignment, in which random spike rearrangement across SNN layers leads to performance improvements. Based on this observation, we introduce biologically plausible two-phase probabilistic (TPP) spiking neurons, further enhancing the conversion process. We demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method both theoretically and empirically through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet across a variety of architectures, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Generalizability of ECG Noise Detection Across Diverse Data Sources and Noise Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for monitoring cardiac health, allowing clinicians to analyze heart rate variability (HRV), detect abnormal rhythms, and diagnose cardiovascular diseases. However, ECG signals, especially those from wearable devices, are often affected by noise artifacts caused by motion, muscle activity, or device-related interference. These artifacts distort R-peaks and the characteristic QRS complex, making HRV analysis unreliable and increasing the risk of misdiagnosis.
  Despite this, the few existing studies on ECG noise detection have primarily focused on a single dataset, limiting the understanding of how well noise detection models generalize across different datasets. In this paper, we investigate the generalizability of noise detection in ECG using a novel HRV-based approach through cross-dataset experiments on four datasets. Our results show that machine learning achieves an average accuracy of over 90\% and an AUPRC of more than 0.9. These findings suggest that regardless of the ECG data source or the type of noise, the proposed method maintains high accuracy even on unseen datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of generalizability.</description>

      <title>Generative adversarial networks vs large language models: a comparative study on synthetic tabular data generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for zero-shot generation of synthetic tabular data. Using the large language model (LLM) GPT-4o and plain-language prompting, we demonstrate the ability to generate high-fidelity tabular data without task-specific fine-tuning or access to real-world data (RWD) for pre-training. To benchmark GPT-4o, we compared the fidelity and privacy of LLM-generated synthetic data against data generated with the conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN), across three open-access datasets: Iris, Fish Measurements, and Real Estate Valuation. Despite the zero-shot approach, GPT-4o outperformed CTGAN in preserving means, 95% confidence intervals, bivariate correlations, and data privacy of RWD, even at amplified sample sizes. Notably, correlations between parameters were consistently preserved with appropriate direction and strength. However, refinement is necessary to better retain distributional characteristics. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in tabular data synthesis, offering an accessible alternative to generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders.</description>

      <title>Small Graph Is All You Need: DeepStateGNN for Scalable Traffic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model, named DeepStateGNN, for analyzing traffic data, demonstrating its efficacy in two critical tasks: forecasting and reconstruction. Unlike typical GNN methods that treat each traffic sensor as an individual graph node, DeepStateGNN clusters sensors into higher-level graph nodes, dubbed Deep State Nodes, based on various similarity criteria, resulting in a fixed number of nodes in a Deep State graph. The term "Deep State" nodes is a play on words, referencing hidden networks of power that, like these nodes, secretly govern traffic independently of visible sensors. These Deep State Nodes are defined by several similarity factors, including spatial proximity (e.g., sensors located nearby in the road network), functional similarity (e.g., sensors on similar types of freeways), and behavioral similarity under specific conditions (e.g., traffic behavior during rain). This clustering approach allows for dynamic and adaptive node grouping, as sensors can belong to multiple clusters and clusters may evolve over time. Our experimental results show that DeepStateGNN offers superior scalability and faster training, while also delivering more accurate results than competitors. It effectively handles large-scale sensor networks, outperforming other methods in both traffic forecasting and reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Inter-turbine Modelling of Wind-Farm Power using Multi-task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the global need to increase power production from renewable energy resources, developments in the online monitoring of the associated infrastructure is of interest to reduce operation and maintenance costs. However, challenges exist for data-driven approaches to this problem, such as incomplete or limited histories of labelled damage-state data, operational and environmental variability, or the desire for the quantification of uncertainty to support risk management.
  This work first introduces a probabilistic regression model for predicting wind-turbine power, which adjusts for wake effects learnt from data. Spatial correlations in the learned model parameters for different tasks (turbines) are then leveraged in a hierarchical Bayesian model (an approach to multi-task learning) to develop a "metamodel", which can be used to make power-predictions which adjust for turbine location - including on previously unobserved turbines not included in the training data. The results show that the metamodel is able to outperform a series of benchmark models, and demonstrates a novel strategy for making efficient use of data for inference in populations of structures, in particular where correlations exist in the variable(s) of interest (such as those from wind-turbine wake-effects).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the preordering problem, a joint relaxation of the correlation clustering problem and the partial ordering problem. We show that preordering remains NP-hard even for values in $\{-1,0,1\}$. We introduce a linear-time $4$-approximation algorithm and a local search technique. For an integer linear program formulation, we establish a class of non-canonical facets of the associated preorder polytope. By solving a non-canonical linear program relaxation, we obtain non-trivial upper bounds on the objective value. We provide implementations of the algorithms we define, apply these to published social networks and compare the output and efficiency qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>An Entropic Metric for Measuring Calibration of Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the confidence with which a machine learning model classifies an input datum is an important, and perhaps under-investigated, concept. In this paper, we propose a new calibration metric, the Entropic Calibration Difference (ECD). Based on existing research in the field of state estimation, specifically target tracking (TT), we show how ECD may be applied to binary classification machine learning models. We describe the relative importance of under- and over-confidence and how they are not conflated in the TT literature. Indeed, our metric distinguishes under- from over-confidence. We consider this important given that algorithms that are under-confident are likely to be 'safer' than algorithms that are over-confident, albeit at the expense of also being over-cautious and so statistically inefficient. We demonstrate how this new metric performs on real and simulated data and compare with other metrics for machine learning model probability calibration, including the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and its signed counterpart, the Expected Signed Calibration Error (ESCE).</description>

      <title>Position: Graph Learning Will Lose Relevance Due To Poor Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine learning on graphs has demonstrated promise in drug design and molecular property prediction, significant benchmarking challenges hinder its further progress and relevance. Current benchmarking practices often lack focus on transformative, real-world applications, favoring narrow domains like two-dimensional molecular graphs over broader, impactful areas such as combinatorial optimization, relational databases, or chip design. Additionally, many benchmark datasets poorly represent the underlying data, leading to inadequate abstractions and misaligned use cases. Fragmented evaluations and an excessive focus on accuracy further exacerbate these issues, incentivizing overfitting rather than fostering generalizable insights. These limitations have prevented the development of truly useful graph foundation models. This position paper calls for a paradigm shift toward more meaningful benchmarks, rigorous evaluation protocols, and stronger collaboration with domain experts to drive impactful and reliable advances in graph learning research, unlocking the potential of graph learning.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models with human preferences. While prior work mainly extends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO from the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection. Specifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data by proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO training. To accurately estimate margins for data selection, we propose a dual-margin guided approach that considers both external reward margins and implicit DPO reward margins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method reduces computational cost dramatically while improving performance. Remarkably, by using just 10\% of the Ultrafeedback dataset, our approach achieves 3\% to 8\% improvements across various Llama and Mistral series models on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends to iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\% improvement with 25\% online data, while further reducing training time. These results highlight the potential of data selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.</description>

      <title>ReVISE: Learning to Refine at Test-Time via Intrinsic Self-Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-awareness, i.e., the ability to assess and correct one's own generation, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, making its replication in large language models (LLMs) an important yet challenging task. Previous works tackle this by employing extensive reinforcement learning or rather relying on large external verifiers. In this work, we propose Refine via Intrinsic Self-Verification (ReVISE), an efficient and effective framework that enables LLMs to self-correct their outputs through self-verification. The core idea of ReVISE is to enable LLMs to verify their reasoning processes and continually rethink reasoning trajectories based on its verification. We introduce a structured curriculum based upon online preference learning to implement this efficiently. Specifically, as ReVISE involves two challenging tasks (i.e., self-verification and reasoning correction), we tackle each task sequentially using curriculum learning, collecting both failed and successful reasoning paths to construct preference pairs for efficient training. During inference, our approach enjoys natural test-time scaling by integrating self-verification and correction capabilities, further enhanced by our proposed confidence-aware decoding mechanism. Our experiments on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that ReVISE achieves efficient self-correction and significantly improves reasoning performance.</description>

      <title>Predicting Filter Medium Performances in Chamber Filter Presses with Digital Twins Using Neural Network Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient solid-liquid separation is crucial in industries like mining, but traditional chamber filter presses depend heavily on manual monitoring, leading to inefficiencies, downtime, and resource wastage. This paper introduces a machine learning-powered digital twin framework to improve operational flexibility and predictive control. A key challenge addressed is the degradation of the filter medium due to repeated cycles and clogging, which reduces filtration efficiency. To solve this, a neural network-based predictive model was developed to forecast operational parameters, such as pressure and flow rates, under various conditions. This predictive capability allows for optimized filtration cycles, reduced downtime, and improved process efficiency. Additionally, the model predicts the filter mediums lifespan, aiding in maintenance planning and resource sustainability. The digital twin framework enables seamless data exchange between filter press sensors and the predictive model, ensuring continuous updates to the training data and enhancing accuracy over time. Two neural network architectures, feedforward and recurrent, were evaluated. The recurrent neural network outperformed the feedforward model, demonstrating superior generalization. It achieved a relative $L^2$-norm error of $5\%$ for pressure and $9.3\%$ for flow rate prediction on partially known data. For completely unknown data, the relative errors were $18.4\%$ and $15.4\%$, respectively. Qualitative analysis showed strong alignment between predicted and measured data, with deviations within a confidence band of $8.2\%$ for pressure and $4.8\%$ for flow rate predictions. This work contributes an accurate predictive model, a new approach to predicting filter medium cycle impacts, and a real-time interface for model updates, ensuring adaptability to changing operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Factor Graph-based Interpretable Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehensible neural network explanations are foundations for a better understanding of decisions, especially when the input data are infused with malicious perturbations. Existing solutions generally mitigate the impact of perturbations through adversarial training, yet they fail to generate comprehensible explanations under unknown perturbations. To address this challenge, we propose AGAIN, a fActor GrAph-based Interpretable neural Network, which is capable of generating comprehensible explanations under unknown perturbations. Instead of retraining like previous solutions, the proposed AGAIN directly integrates logical rules by which logical errors in explanations are identified and rectified during inference. Specifically, we construct the factor graph to express logical rules between explanations and categories. By treating logical rules as exogenous knowledge, AGAIN can identify incomprehensible explanations that violate real-world logic. Furthermore, we propose an interactive intervention switch strategy rectifying explanations based on the logical guidance from the factor graph without learning perturbations, which overcomes the inherent limitation of adversarial training-based methods in defending only against known perturbations. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of employing factor graph by proving that the comprehensibility of explanations is strongly correlated with factor graph. Extensive experiments are conducted on three datasets and experimental results illustrate the superior performance of AGAIN compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>A Theory for Conditional Generative Modeling on Multiple Data Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of large generative models has driven a paradigm shift, leveraging massive multi-source data to enhance model capabilities. However, the interaction among these sources remains theoretically underexplored. This paper takes the first step toward a rigorous analysis of multi-source training in conditional generative modeling, where each condition represents a distinct data source. Specifically, we establish a general distribution estimation error bound in average total variation distance for conditional maximum likelihood estimation based on the bracketing number. Our result shows that when source distributions share certain similarities and the model is expressive enough, multi-source training guarantees a sharper bound than single-source training. We further instantiate the general theory on conditional Gaussian estimation and deep generative models including autoregressive and flexible energy-based models, by characterizing their bracketing numbers. The results highlight that the number of sources and similarity among source distributions improve the advantage of multi-source training. Simulations and real-world experiments validate our theory.

      <title>Moshi Moshi? A Model Selection Hijacking Adversarial Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model selection is a fundamental task in Machine Learning~(ML), focusing on selecting the most suitable model from a pool of candidates by evaluating their performance on specific metrics. This process ensures optimal performance, computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse tasks and environments. Despite its critical role, its security from the perspective of adversarial ML remains unexplored. This risk is heightened in the Machine-Learning-as-a-Service model, where users delegate the training phase and the model selection process to third-party providers, supplying data and training strategies. Therefore, attacks on model selection could harm both the user and the provider, undermining model performance and driving up operational costs.
  In this work, we present MOSHI (MOdel Selection HIjacking adversarial attack), the first adversarial attack specifically targeting model selection. Our novel approach manipulates model selection data to favor the adversary, even without prior knowledge of the system. Utilizing a framework based on Variational Auto Encoders, we provide evidence that an attacker can induce inefficiencies in ML deployment. We test our attack on diverse computer vision and speech recognition benchmark tasks and different settings, obtaining an average attack success rate of 75.42%. In particular, our attack causes an average 88.30% decrease in generalization capabilities, an 83.33% increase in latency, and an increase of up to 105.85% in energy consumption. These results highlight the significant vulnerabilities in model selection processes and their potential impact on real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Class Imbalanced Learning with Support Vector Machines via Differential Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm to handle classification tasks. However, the classical SVM is developed for binary problems with the assumption of balanced datasets. Obviously, the multi-class imbalanced classification problems are more complex. In this paper, we propose an improved SVM via Differential Evolution (i-SVM-DE) method to deal with it. An improved SVM (i-SVM) model is proposed to handle the data imbalance by combining cost sensitive technique and separation margin modification in the constraints, which formalize a parameter optimization problem. By using one-versus-one (OVO) scheme, a multi-class problem is decomposed into a number of binary subproblems. A large optimization problem is formalized through concatenating the parameters in the binary subproblems. To find the optimal model effectively and learn the support vectors for each class simultaneously, an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm is applied to solve this large optimization problem. Instead of the validation set, we propose the fitness functions to evaluate the learned model and obtain the optimal parameters in the search process of DE. A series of experiments are carried out to verify the benefits of our proposed method. The results indicate that i-SVM-DE is statistically superior by comparing with the other baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Noisy Test-Time Adaptation in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to address distribution shifts between source and target data by relying solely on target data during testing. In open-world scenarios, models often encounter noisy samples, i.e., samples outside the in-distribution (ID) label space. Leveraging the zero-shot capability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), this paper introduces Zero-Shot Noisy TTA (ZS-NTTA), focusing on adapting the model to target data with noisy samples during test-time in a zero-shot manner. We find existing TTA methods underperform under ZS-NTTA, often lagging behind even the frozen model. We conduct comprehensive experiments to analyze this phenomenon, revealing that the negative impact of unfiltered noisy data outweighs the benefits of clean data during model updating. Also, adapting a classifier for ID classification and noise detection hampers both sub-tasks. Built on this, we propose a framework that decouples the classifier and detector, focusing on developing an individual detector while keeping the classifier frozen. Technically, we introduce the Adaptive Noise Detector (AdaND), which utilizes the frozen model's outputs as pseudo-labels to train a noise detector. To handle clean data streams, we further inject Gaussian noise during adaptation, preventing the detector from misclassifying clean samples as noisy. Beyond the ZS-NTTA, AdaND can also improve the zero-shot out-of-distribution (ZS-OOD) detection ability of VLMs. Experiments show that AdaND outperforms in both ZS-NTTA and ZS-OOD detection. On ImageNet, AdaND achieves a notable improvement of $8.32\%$ in harmonic mean accuracy ($\text{Acc}_\text{H}$) for ZS-NTTA and $9.40\%$ in FPR95 for ZS-OOD detection, compared to SOTA methods. Importantly, AdaND is computationally efficient and comparable to the model-frozen method. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/ZS-NTTA.</description>

      <title>Reward Models Identify Consistency, Not Causality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning quality. Traditionally, RMs are trained to rank candidate outputs based on their correctness and coherence. However, in this work, we present several surprising findings that challenge common assumptions about RM behavior. Our analysis reveals that state-of-the-art reward models prioritize structural consistency over causal correctness. Specifically, removing the problem statement has minimal impact on reward scores, whereas altering numerical values or disrupting the reasoning flow significantly affects RM outputs. Furthermore, RMs exhibit a strong dependence on complete reasoning trajectories truncated or incomplete steps lead to significant variations in reward assignments, indicating that RMs primarily rely on learned reasoning patterns rather than explicit problem comprehension. These findings hold across multiple architectures, datasets, and tasks, leading to three key insights: (1) RMs primarily assess coherence rather than true reasoning quality; (2) The role of explicit problem comprehension in reward assignment is overstated; (3) Current RMs may be more effective at ranking responses than verifying logical validity. Our results suggest a fundamental limitation in existing reward modeling approaches, emphasizing the need for a shift toward causality-aware reward models that go beyond consistency-driven evaluation.</description>

      <title>PEARL: Towards Permutation-Resilient LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-context learning (ICL) capability of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform challenging tasks using provided demonstrations. However, ICL is highly sensitive to the ordering of demonstrations, leading to instability in predictions. This paper shows that this vulnerability can be exploited to design a natural attack - difficult for model providers to detect - that achieves nearly 80% success rate on LLaMA-3 by simply permuting the demonstrations. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on post-processing and fail to enhance the model's inherent robustness to input permutations, raising concerns about safety and reliability of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose Permutation-resilient learning (PEARL), a novel framework based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which optimizes model performance against the worst-case input permutation. Specifically, PEARL consists of a permutation-proposal network (P-Net) and the LLM. The P-Net generates the most challenging permutations by treating it as an optimal transport problem, which is solved using an entropy-constrained Sinkhorn algorithm. Through minimax optimization, the P-Net and the LLM iteratively optimize against each other, progressively improving the LLM's robustness. Experiments on synthetic pre-training and real-world instruction tuning tasks demonstrate that PEARL effectively mitigates permutation attacks and enhances performance. Notably, despite being trained on fewer shots and shorter contexts, PEARL achieves performance gains of up to 40% when scaled to many-shot and long-context scenarios, highlighting its efficiency and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Fusion of Multi-Source Knowledge via Evidence Theory for High-Entropy Alloy Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering novel high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with desirable properties is challenging due to the vast compositional space and complex phase formation mechanisms. Efficient exploration of this space requires a strategic approach that integrates heterogeneous knowledge sources. Here, we propose a framework that systematically combines knowledge extracted from computational material datasets with domain knowledge distilled from scientific literature using large language models (LLMs). A central feature of this approach is the explicit consideration of element substitutability, identifying chemically similar elements that can be interchanged to potentially stabilize desired HEAs. Dempster-Shafer theory, a mathematical framework for reasoning under uncertainty, is employed to model and combine substitutabilities based on aggregated evidence from multiple sources. The framework predicts the phase stability of candidate HEA compositions and is systematically evaluated on both quaternary alloy systems, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline machine learning models and methods reliant on single-source evidence in cross-validation experiments. By leveraging multi-source knowledge, the framework retains robust predictive power even when key elements are absent from the training data, underscoring its potential for knowledge transfer and extrapolation. Furthermore, the enhanced interpretability of the methodology offers insights into the fundamental factors governing HEA formation. Overall, this work provides a promising strategy for accelerating HEA discovery by integrating computational and textual knowledge sources, enabling efficient exploration of vast compositional spaces with improved generalization and interpretability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios that demand precise mathematical calculations and knowledge-intensive open-domain generation. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware framework designed to enhance the accuracy of LLM responses by systematically incorporating model confidence at critical decision points. We propose an approach that encourages multi-step reasoning in LLMs and quantify the confidence of intermediate answers such as numerical results in mathematical reasoning and proper nouns in open-domain generation. Then, the overall confidence of each reasoning chain is evaluated based on confidence of these critical intermediate steps. Finally, we aggregate the answer of generated response paths in a way that reflects the reliability of each generated content (as opposed to self-consistency in which each generated chain contributes equally to majority voting). We conducted extensive experiments in five datasets, three mathematical datasets and two open-domain datasets, using four LLMs. The results consistently validate the effectiveness of our novel confidence aggregation method, leading to an accuracy improvement of up to 7.4% and 5.8% over baseline approaches in math and open-domain generation tasks, respectively.

      <title>ReQFlow: Rectified Quaternion Flow for Efficient and High-Quality Protein Backbone Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein backbone generation plays a central role in de novo protein design and is significant for many biological and medical applications. Although diffusion and flow-based generative models provide potential solutions to this challenging task, they often generate proteins with undesired designability and suffer computational inefficiency. In this study, we propose a novel rectified quaternion flow (ReQFlow) matching method for fast and high-quality protein backbone generation. In particular, our method generates a local translation and a 3D rotation from random noise for each residue in a protein chain, which represents each 3D rotation as a unit quaternion and constructs its flow by spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) in an exponential format. We train the model by quaternion flow (QFlow) matching with guaranteed numerical stability and rectify the QFlow model to accelerate its inference and improve the designability of generated protein backbones, leading to the proposed ReQFlow model. Experiments show that ReQFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in protein backbone generation while requiring much fewer sampling steps and significantly less inference time (e.g., being 37x faster than RFDiffusion and 62x faster than Genie2 when generating a backbone of length 300), demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

      <title>Variance Reduction Methods Do Not Need to Compute Full Gradients: Improved Efficiency through Shuffling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's world, machine learning is hard to imagine without large training datasets and models. This has led to the use of stochastic methods for training, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). SGD provides weak theoretical guarantees of convergence, but there are modifications, such as Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) and StochAstic Recursive grAdient algoritHm (SARAH), that can reduce the variance. These methods require the computation of the full gradient occasionally, which can be time consuming. In this paper, we explore variants of variance reduction algorithms that eliminate the need for full gradient computations. To make our approach memory-efficient and avoid full gradient computations, we use two key techniques: the shuffling heuristic and idea of SAG/SAGA methods. As a result, we improve existing estimates for variance reduction algorithms without the full gradient computations. Additionally, for the non-convex objective function, our estimate matches that of classic shuffling methods, while for the strongly convex one, it is an improvement. We conduct comprehensive theoretical analysis and provide extensive experimental results to validate the efficiency and practicality of our methods for large-scale machine learning problems.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Surface: Uncovering Implicit Locations with LLMs for Personalized Local News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: News recommendation systems personalize homepage content to boost engagement, but factors like content type, editorial stance, and geographic focus impact recommendations. Local newspapers balance coverage across regions, yet identifying local articles is challenging due to implicit location cues like slang or landmarks.
  Traditional methods, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Knowledge Graphs, infer locations, but Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new possibilities while raising concerns about accuracy and explainability.
  This paper explores LLMs for local article classification in Taboola's "Homepage For You" system, comparing them to traditional techniques. Key findings: (1) Knowledge Graphs enhance NER models' ability to detect implicit locations, (2) LLMs outperform traditional methods, and (3) LLMs can effectively identify local content without requiring Knowledge Graph integration.
  Offline evaluations showed LLMs excel at implicit location classification, while online A/B tests showed a significant increased in local views. A scalable pipeline integrating LLM-based location classification boosted local article distribution by 27%, preserving newspapers' brand identity and enhancing homepage personalization.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Latent Spaces for Reduced Order Models using Deterministic Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven reduced-order models based on autoencoders generally lack interpretability compared to classical methods such as the proper orthogonal decomposition. More interpretability can be gained by disentangling the latent variables and analyzing the resulting modes. For this purpose, probabilistic $\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) are frequently used in computational fluid dynamics and other simulation sciences. Using a benchmark periodic flow dataset, we show that competitive results can be achieved using non-probabilistic autoencoder approaches that either promote orthogonality or penalize correlation between latent variables. Compared to probabilistic autoencoders, these approaches offer more robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters entering the loss function. We further demonstrate the ability of a non-probabilistic approach to identify a reduced number of active latent variables by introducing a correlation penalty, a function also known from the use of $\beta$-VAE. The investigated probabilistic and non-probabilistic autoencoder models are finally used for the dimensionality reduction of aircraft ditching loads, which serves as an industrial application in this work.</description>

      <title>seqKAN: Sequence processing with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been recently proposed as a machine learning framework that is more interpretable and controllable than the multi-layer perceptron. Various network architectures have been proposed within the KAN framework targeting different tasks and application domains, including sequence processing.
  This paper proposes seqKAN, a new KAN architecture for sequence processing. Although multiple sequence processing KAN architectures have already been proposed, we argue that seqKAN is more faithful to the core concept of the KAN framework. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it achieves better results.
  The empirical evaluation is performed on generated data from a complex physics problem on an interpolation and an extrapolation task. Using this dataset we compared seqKAN against a prior KAN network for timeseries prediction, recurrent deep networks, and symbolic regression. seqKAN substantially outperforms all architectures, particularly on the extrapolation dataset, while also being the most transparent.</description>

      <title>General Uncertainty Estimation with Delta Variances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision makers may suffer from uncertainty induced by limited data. This may be mitigated by accounting for epistemic uncertainty, which is however challenging to estimate efficiently for large neural networks. To this extent we investigate Delta Variances, a family of algorithms for epistemic uncertainty quantification, that is computationally efficient and convenient to implement. It can be applied to neural networks and more general functions composed of neural networks. As an example we consider a weather simulator with a neural-network-based step function inside -- here Delta Variances empirically obtain competitive results at the cost of a single gradient computation. The approach is convenient as it requires no changes to the neural network architecture or training procedure. We discuss multiple ways to derive Delta Variances theoretically noting that special cases recover popular techniques and present a unified perspective on multiple related methods. Finally we observe that this general perspective gives rise to a natural extension and empirically show its benefit.</description>

      <title>Not All Data are Good Labels: On the Self-supervised Labeling for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is a crucial task in various domains, yet existing TSF models rely heavily on high-quality data and insufficiently exploit all available data. This paper explores a novel self-supervised approach to re-label time series datasets by inherently constructing candidate datasets. During the optimization of a simple reconstruction network, intermediates are used as pseudo labels in a self-supervised paradigm, improving generalization for any predictor. We introduce the Self-Correction with Adaptive Mask (SCAM), which discards overfitted components and selectively replaces them with pseudo labels generated from reconstructions. Additionally, we incorporate Spectral Norm Regularization (SNR) to further suppress overfitting from a loss landscape perspective. Our experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that SCAM consistently improves the performance of various backbone models. This work offers a new perspective on constructing datasets and enhancing the generalization of TSF models through self-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Sculpting [CLS] Features for Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class-incremental learning requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Although pre-trained models have demonstrated strong performance in class-incremental learning, they remain susceptible to catastrophic forgetting when learning new concepts. Excessive plasticity in the models breaks generalizability and causes forgetting, while strong stability results in insufficient adaptation to new classes. This necessitates effective adaptation with minimal modifications to preserve the general knowledge of pre-trained models. To address this challenge, we first introduce a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning module 'Learn and Calibrate', or LuCA, designed to acquire knowledge through an adapter-calibrator couple, enabling effective adaptation with well-refined feature representations. Second, for each learning session, we deploy a sparse LuCA module on top of the last token just before the classifier, which we refer to as 'Token-level Sparse Calibration and Adaptation', or TOSCA. This strategic design improves the orthogonality between the modules and significantly reduces both training and inference complexity. By leaving the generalization capabilities of the pre-trained models intact and adapting exclusively via the last token, our approach achieves a harmonious balance between stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments demonstrate TOSCA's state-of-the-art performance while introducing ~8 times fewer parameters compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>Determining Layer-wise Sparsity for Large Language Models Through a Theoretical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of determining the layer-wise sparsity rates of large language models (LLMs) through a theoretical perspective. Specifically, we identify a critical issue of ''$\textbf{reconstruction error explosion}$'' in existing LLMs sparsification methods. This refers to the cumulative effect of reconstruction errors throughout the sparsification process, where errors from earlier layers propagate and amplify in subsequent layers. As a result, the overall reconstruction error increases significantly, leading to a substantial degradation in model performance. Through theoretical analysis, we derive a simple yet effective approach to layer-wise sparsity allocation that mitigates this issue. Our method uses a monotonically increasing arithmetic progression, reducing the process of determining sparsity rates for multiple layers to the determination of a single common difference hyperparameter. Remarkably, this allows for the optimal layer-wise sparsity rates to be identified with just a few trials. Both our theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that this sparsity allocation scheme is near optimal. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the performance of sparse LLMs across various architectures, outperforming existing layer-wise sparsity methods. Furthermore, it enhances the performance of various compression techniques and is applicable to vision and multimodal models. Notably, our method achieves a reduction of 52.10 in perplexity for the 70$\%$ sparse LLaMA2-7B model obtained via Wanda, improves average zero-shot accuracy by 10.50$\%$, and delivers speedups of 2.63$\times$ and 2.23$\times$ on CPU and GPU, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sparse Activations as Conformal Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification that replaces point predictions with sets, offering marginal coverage guarantees (i.e., ensuring that the prediction sets contain the true label with a specified probability, in expectation). In this paper, we uncover a novel connection between conformal prediction and sparse softmax-like transformations, such as sparsemax and $\gamma$-entmax (with $\gamma &gt; 1$), which may assign nonzero probability only to a subset of labels. We introduce new non-conformity scores for classification that make the calibration process correspond to the widely used temperature scaling method. At test time, applying these sparse transformations with the calibrated temperature leads to a support set (i.e., the set of labels with nonzero probability) that automatically inherits the coverage guarantees of conformal prediction. Through experiments on computer vision and text classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive results in terms of coverage, efficiency, and adaptiveness compared to standard non-conformity scores based on softmax.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture for conditionally activated neural networks combining a hierarchical construction of multiple Mixture of Experts (MoEs) layers with a sampling mechanism that progressively converges to an optimized configuration of expert activation. This methodology enables the dynamic unfolding of the network's architecture, facilitating efficient path-specific training. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves competitive accuracy compared to conventional baselines while significantly reducing the parameter count required for inference. Notably, this parameter reduction correlates with the complexity of the input patterns, a property naturally emerging from the network's operational dynamics without necessitating explicit auxiliary penalty functions.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Full-information Online Learning: from Finite to Infinite Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analysis of Thompson sampling for online learning under full feedback - also known as prediction with expert advice - where the learner's prior is defined over the space of an adversary's future actions, rather than the space of experts. We show regret decomposes into regret the learner expected a priori, plus a prior-robustness-type term we call excess regret. In the classical finite-expert setting, this recovers optimal rates. As an initial step towards practical online learning in settings with a potentially-uncountably-infinite number of experts, we show that Thompson sampling with a certain Gaussian process prior widely-used in the Bayesian optimization literature has a $\mathcal{O}(\beta\sqrt{T\log(1+\lambda)})$ rate against a $\beta$-bounded $\lambda$-Lipschitz~adversary.</description>

      <title>PREM: Privately Answering Statistical Queries with Relative Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathsf{PREM}$ (Private Relative Error Multiplicative weight update), a new framework for generating synthetic data that achieves a relative error guarantee for statistical queries under $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ differential privacy (DP). Namely, for a domain ${\cal X}$, a family ${\cal F}$ of queries $f : {\cal X} \to \{0, 1\}$, and $\zeta &gt; 0$, our framework yields a mechanism that on input dataset $D \in {\cal X}^n$ outputs a synthetic dataset $\widehat{D} \in {\cal X}^n$ such that all statistical queries in ${\cal F}$ on $D$, namely $\sum_{x \in D} f(x)$ for $f \in {\cal F}$, are within a $1 \pm \zeta$ multiplicative factor of the corresponding value on $\widehat{D}$ up to an additive error that is polynomial in $\log |{\cal F}|$, $\log |{\cal X}|$, $\log n$, $\log(1/\delta)$, $1/\varepsilon$, and $1/\zeta$. In contrast, any $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP mechanism is known to require worst-case additive error that is polynomial in at least one of $n, |{\cal F}|$, or $|{\cal X}|$. We complement our algorithm with nearly matching lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Low-Rank Sparse Adaptation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the efficacy of network sparsity in alleviating the deployment strain of Large Language Models (LLMs), it endures significant performance degradation. Applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the sparse LLMs offers an intuitive approach to counter this predicament, while it holds shortcomings include: 1) The inability to integrate LoRA weights into sparse LLMs post-training, and 2) Insufficient performance recovery at high sparsity ratios. In this paper, we introduce dynamic Low-rank Sparse Adaptation (LoSA), a novel method that seamlessly integrates low-rank adaptation into LLM sparsity within a unified framework, thereby enhancing the performance of sparse LLMs without increasing the inference latency. In particular, LoSA dynamically sparsifies the LoRA outcomes based on the corresponding sparse weights during fine-tuning, thus guaranteeing that the LoRA module can be integrated into the sparse LLMs post-training. Besides, LoSA leverages Representation Mutual Information (RMI) as an indicator to determine the importance of layers, thereby efficiently determining the layer-wise sparsity rates during fine-tuning. Predicated on this, LoSA adjusts the rank of the LoRA module based on the variability in layer-wise reconstruction errors, allocating an appropriate fine-tuning for each layer to reduce the output discrepancies between dense and sparse LLMs. Extensive experiments tell that LoSA can efficiently boost the efficacy of sparse LLMs within a few hours, without introducing any additional inferential burden. For example, LoSA reduced the perplexity of sparse LLaMA-2-7B by 68.73 and increased zero-shot accuracy by 16.32$\%$, achieving a 2.60$\times$ speedup on CPU and 2.23$\times$ speedup on GPU, requiring only 45 minutes of fine-tuning on a single NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU.

      <title>Learning from Reward-Free Offline Data: A Case for Planning with Latent Dynamics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing goal in AI is to build agents that can solve a variety of tasks across different environments, including previously unseen ones. Two dominant approaches tackle this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL), which learns policies through trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which plans actions using a learned or known dynamics model. However, their relative strengths and weaknesses remain underexplored in the setting where agents must learn from offline trajectories without reward annotations. In this work, we systematically analyze the performance of different RL and control-based methods under datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and use it for planning. We study how dataset properties-such as data diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability-affect the performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL excels when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning excels in generalization to novel environment layouts, trajectory stitching, and data-efficiency. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model emerges as a promising approach for zero-shot generalization from suboptimal data.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limitations in Defending LLM Finetuning APIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM developers have imposed technical interventions to prevent fine-tuning misuse attacks, attacks where adversaries evade safeguards by fine-tuning the model using a public API. Previous work has established several successful attacks against specific fine-tuning API defences. In this work, we show that defences of fine-tuning APIs that seek to detect individual harmful training or inference samples ('pointwise' detection) are fundamentally limited in their ability to prevent fine-tuning attacks. We construct 'pointwise-undetectable' attacks that repurpose entropy in benign model outputs (e.g. semantic or syntactic variations) to covertly transmit dangerous knowledge. Our attacks are composed solely of unsuspicious benign samples that can be collected from the model before fine-tuning, meaning training and inference samples are all individually benign and low-perplexity. We test our attacks against the OpenAI fine-tuning API, finding they succeed in eliciting answers to harmful multiple-choice questions, and that they evade an enhanced monitoring system we design that successfully detects other fine-tuning attacks. We encourage the community to develop defences that tackle the fundamental limitations we uncover in pointwise fine-tuning API defences.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Robustness in Deep Learning: A Concise yet Comprehensive Guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated significant potential across various safety-critical applications, yet ensuring its robustness remains a key challenge. While adversarial robustness has been extensively studied in worst-case scenarios, probabilistic robustness (PR) offers a more practical perspective by quantifying the likelihood of failures under stochastic perturbations. This paper provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of PR, covering its formal definitions, evaluation and enhancement methods. We introduce a reformulated ''min-max'' optimisation framework for adversarial training specifically designed to improve PR. Furthermore, we explore the integration of PR verification evidence into system-level safety assurance, addressing challenges in translating DL model-level robustness to system-level claims. Finally, we highlight open research questions, including benchmarking PR evaluation methods, extending PR to generative AI tasks, and developing rigorous methodologies and case studies for system-level integration.</description>

      <title>Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given inputs of diverse soil characteristics and climate data gathered from various regions, we aimed to build a model to predict accurate land emissions. The problem is important since accurate quantification of the carbon cycle in agroecosystems is crucial for mitigating climate change and ensuring sustainable food production. Predicting accurate land emissions is challenging since calibrating the heterogeneous nature of soil properties, moisture, and environmental conditions is hard at decision-relevant scales. Traditional approaches do not adequately estimate land emissions due to location-independent parameters failing to leverage the spatial heterogeneity and also require large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we proposed Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (SDSA-KGML), which leverages location-dependent parameters that account for significant spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture from multiple sites within the same region. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSA-KGML models achieve higher local accuracy for the specified states in the Midwest Region.</description>

      <title>Generating $\pi$-Functional Molecules Using STGG+ with Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating novel molecules with out-of-distribution properties is a major challenge in molecular discovery. While supervised learning methods generate high-quality molecules similar to those in a dataset, they struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution properties. Reinforcement learning can explore new chemical spaces but often conducts 'reward-hacking' and generates non-synthesizable molecules. In this work, we address this problem by integrating a state-of-the-art supervised learning method, STGG+, in an active learning loop. Our approach iteratively generates, evaluates, and fine-tunes STGG+ to continuously expand its knowledge. We denote this approach STGG+AL. We apply STGG+AL to the design of organic $\pi$-functional materials, specifically two challenging tasks: 1) generating highly absorptive molecules characterized by high oscillator strength and 2) designing absorptive molecules with reasonable oscillator strength in the near-infrared (NIR) range. The generated molecules are validated and rationalized in-silico with time-dependent density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that our method is highly effective in generating novel molecules with high oscillator strength, contrary to existing methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We open-source our active-learning code along with our Conjugated-xTB dataset containing 2.9 million $\pi$-conjugated molecules and the function for approximating the oscillator strength and absorption wavelength (based on sTDA-xTB).</description>

      <title>Prompt-to-Leaderboard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) evaluations typically rely on aggregated metrics like accuracy or human preference, averaging across users and prompts. This averaging obscures user- and prompt-specific variations in model performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-to-Leaderboard (P2L), a method that produces leaderboards specific to a prompt. The core idea is to train an LLM taking natural language prompts as input to output a vector of Bradley-Terry coefficients which are then used to predict the human preference vote. The resulting prompt-dependent leaderboards allow for unsupervised task-specific evaluation, optimal routing of queries to models, personalization, and automated evaluation of model strengths and weaknesses. Data from Chatbot Arena suggest that P2L better captures the nuanced landscape of language model performance than the averaged leaderboard. Furthermore, our findings suggest that P2L's ability to produce prompt-specific evaluations follows a power law scaling similar to that observed in LLMs themselves. In January 2025, the router we trained based on this methodology achieved the \#1 spot in the Chatbot Arena leaderboard. Our code is available at this GitHub link: https://github.com/lmarena/p2l.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning techniques have been shown to be highly effective in real-world control scenarios, such as robotics. However, these approaches not only suffer from compounding error issues but also require human experts to provide complete trajectories. Although there exist interactive methods where an expert oversees the robot and intervenes if needed, these extensions usually only utilize the data collected during intervention periods and ignore the feedback signal hidden in non-intervention timesteps. In this work, we create a model to formulate how the interventions occur in such cases, and show that it is possible to learn a policy with just a handful of expert interventions. Our key insight is that it is possible to get crucial information about the quality of the current state and the optimality of the chosen action from expert feedback, regardless of the presence or the absence of intervention. We evaluate our method on various discrete and continuous simulation environments, a real-world robotic manipulation task, as well as a human subject study.

      <title>IncepFormerNet: A multi-scale multi-head attention network for SSVEP classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have shown outstanding performance in EEG classification tasks, particularly in Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential(SSVEP)-based Brain-Computer-Interfaces(BCI)systems. DL methods have been successfully applied to SSVEP-BCI. This study proposes a new model called IncepFormerNet, which is a hybrid of the Inception and Transformer architectures. IncepFormerNet adeptly extracts multi-scale temporal information from time series data using parallel convolution kernels of varying sizes, accurately capturing the subtle variations and critical features within SSVEP signals.Furthermore, the model integrates the multi-head attention mechanism from the Transformer architecture, which not only provides insights into global dependencies but also significantly enhances the understanding and representation of complex patterns.Additionally, it takes advantage of filter bank techniques to extract features based on the spectral characteristics of SSVEP data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conducted experiments on two public datasets, . The experimental results show that IncepFormerNet achieves an accuracy of 87.41 on Dataset 1 and 71.97 on Dataset 2 using a 1.0-second time window. To further verify the superiority of the proposed model, we compared it with other deep learning models, and the results indicate that our method achieves significantly higher accuracy than the others.The source codes in this work are available at: https://github.com/CECNL/SSVEP-DAN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial risks can propagate across both tightly coupled temporal and spatial dimensions, posing significant threats to financial stability. Moreover, risks embedded in unlabeled data are often difficult to detect. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphShield, a novel approach with three key innovations: Enhanced Cross-Domain Infor mation Learning: We propose a dynamic graph learning module to improve information learning across temporal and spatial domains. Advanced Risk Recognition: By leveraging the clustering characteristics of risks, we construct a risk recognizing module to enhance the identification of hidden threats. Risk Propagation Visualization: We provide a visualization tool for quantifying and validating nodes that trigger widespread cascading risks. Extensive experiments on two real-world and two open-source datasets demonstrate the robust performance of our framework. Our approach represents a significant advancement in leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance financial stability, offering a powerful solution to mitigate the spread of risks within financial networks.</description>

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Voice Recognition agents are rapidly evolving healthcare by enabling efficient, accessible, and professional patient support while automating grunt work. This report serves as my self project wherein models finetuned on medical call recordings are analysed through a two-stage system: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for speech transcription and a Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware, professional responses. ASR, finetuned on phone call recordings provides generalised transcription of diverse patient speech over call, while the LLM matches transcribed text to medical diagnosis. A novel audio preprocessing strategy, is deployed to provide invariance to incoming recording/call data, laden with sufficient augmentation with noise/clipping to make the pipeline robust to the type of microphone and ambient conditions the patient might have while calling/recording.</description>

      <title>Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation Quality Assessment based on Vision Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of scenes and variations in image quality result in significant variability in the performance of semantic segmentation methods of remote sensing imagery (RSI) in supervised real-world scenarios. This makes the evaluation of semantic segmentation quality in such scenarios an issue to be resolved. However, most of the existing evaluation metrics are developed based on expert-labeled object-level annotations, which are not applicable in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose RS-SQA, an unsupervised quality assessment model for RSI semantic segmentation based on vision language model (VLM). This framework leverages a pre-trained RS VLM for semantic understanding and utilizes intermediate features from segmentation methods to extract implicit information about segmentation quality. Specifically, we introduce CLIP-RS, a large-scale pre-trained VLM trained with purified text to reduce textual noise and capture robust semantic information in the RS domain. Feature visualizations confirm that CLIP-RS can effectively differentiate between various levels of segmentation quality. Semantic features and low-level segmentation features are effectively integrated through a semantic-guided approach to enhance evaluation accuracy. To further support the development of RS semantic segmentation quality assessment, we present RS-SQED, a dedicated dataset sampled from four major RS semantic segmentation datasets and annotated with segmentation accuracy derived from the inference results of 8 representative segmentation methods. Experimental results on the established dataset demonstrate that RS-SQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment models. This provides essential support for predicting segmentation accuracy and high-quality semantic segmentation interpretation, offering substantial practical value.</description>

      <title>Towards a perturbation-based explanation for medical AI as differentiable programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancement in machine learning algorithms reaches a point where medical devices can be equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) models for diagnostic support and routine automation in clinical settings. In medicine and healthcare, there is a particular demand for sufficient and objective explainability of the outcome generated by AI models. However, AI models are generally considered as black boxes due to their complexity, and the computational process leading to their response is often opaque. Although several methods have been proposed to explain the behavior of models by evaluating the importance of each feature in discrimination and prediction, they may suffer from biases and opacities arising from the scale and sampling protocol of the dataset used for training or testing. To overcome the shortcomings of existing methods, we explore an alternative approach to provide an objective explanation of AI models that can be defined independently of the learning process and does not require additional data. As a preliminary study for this direction of research, this work examines a numerical availability of the Jacobian matrix of deep learning models that measures how stably a model responses against small perturbations added to the input. The indicator, if available, are calculated from a trained AI model for a given target input. This is a first step towards a perturbation-based explanation, which will assist medical practitioners in understanding and interpreting the response of the AI model in its clinical application.</description>

      <title>Inter3D: A Benchmark and Strong Baseline for Human-Interactive 3D Object Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in implicit 3D reconstruction methods, e.g., neural rendering fields and Gaussian splatting, have primarily focused on novel view synthesis of static or dynamic objects with continuous motion states. However, these approaches struggle to efficiently model a human-interactive object with n movable parts, requiring 2^n separate models to represent all discrete states. To overcome this limitation, we propose Inter3D, a new benchmark and approach for novel state synthesis of human-interactive objects. We introduce a self-collected dataset featuring commonly encountered interactive objects and a new evaluation pipeline, where only individual part states are observed during training, while part combination states remain unseen. We also propose a strong baseline approach that leverages Space Discrepancy Tensors to efficiently modelling all states of an object. To alleviate the impractical constraints on camera trajectories across training states, we propose a Mutual State Regularization mechanism to enhance the spatial density consistency of movable parts. In addition, we explore two occupancy grid sampling strategies to facilitate training efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark, showcasing the challenges of the task and the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <title>MaskPrune: Mask-based LLM Pruning for Layer-wise Uniform Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in various language tasks has attracted considerable attention. However, the ever-increasing size of these models presents growing challenges for deployment and inference. Structured pruning, an effective model compression technique, is gaining increasing attention due to its ability to enhance inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most previous optimization-based structured pruning methods sacrifice the uniform structure across layers for greater flexibility to maintain performance. The heterogeneous structure hinders the effective utilization of off-the-shelf inference acceleration techniques and impedes efficient configuration for continued training. To address this issue, we propose a novel masking learning paradigm based on minimax optimization to obtain the uniform pruned structure by optimizing the masks under sparsity regularization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can maintain high performance while ensuring the uniformity of the pruned model structure, thereby outperforming existing SOTA methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing MRI from highly undersampled measurements is crucial for accelerating medical imaging, but is challenging due to the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. While supervised deep learning approaches have shown remarkable success, they rely on fully-sampled ground truth data, which is often impractical or impossible to obtain. Recently, numerous self-supervised methods have emerged that do not require ground truth, however, the lack of systematic comparison and standard experimental setups have hindered research. We present the first comprehensive review of loss functions from all feedforward self-supervised methods and the first benchmark on accelerated MRI reconstruction without ground truth, showing that there is a wide range in performance across methods. In addition, we propose Multi-Operator Equivariant Imaging (MO-EI), a novel framework that builds on the imaging model considered in existing methods to outperform all state-of-the-art and approaches supervised performance. Finally, to facilitate reproducible benchmarking, we provide implementations of all methods in the DeepInverse library (https://deepinv.github.io) and easy-to-use demo code at https://andrewwango.github.io/deepinv-selfsup-fastmri.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their increasing performance, large language models still tend to reproduce training data, generate several repetitions, and focus on the most common grammatical structures and words. A possible cause is the decoding strategy adopted: the most common ones either consider only the most probable tokens, reducing output diversity, or increase the likelihood of unlikely tokens at the cost of output accuracy and correctness. In this paper, we propose a family of three new decoding methods by leveraging a mathematical analysis of the token probability distribution. In particular, the difference between consecutive, sorted probabilities can be used to avoid incorrect tokens and increase the chance of low-probable but accurate words. Experiments concerning math problem solving, extreme summarization, and the divergent association task show that our approach consistently performs at least as well as current alternatives in terms of quality and diversity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cognition and Explainability of Multimodal Foundation Models with Self-Synthesized Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown impressive capabilities in a wide range of visual tasks. However, they often struggle with fine-grained visual reasoning, failing to identify domain-specific objectives and provide justifiable explanations for their predictions. To address this, we propose a novel visual rejection sampling framework to improve the cognition and explainability of LMMs using self-synthesized data. Specifically, visual fine-tuning requires images, queries, and target answers. Our approach begins by synthesizing interpretable answers that include human-verifiable visual features. These features are based on expert-defined concepts, carefully selected based on their alignment with the image content. After each round of fine-tuning, we apply a reward model-free filtering mechanism to select the highest-quality interpretable answers for the next round of tuning. This iterative process of data synthesis and fine-tuning progressively improves the model's ability to generate accurate and reasonable explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving both the accuracy and explainability of specialized visual classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Diversity-driven Data Selection for Language Model Tuning through Sparse Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current pre-trained large language models typically need instruction tuning to align with human preferences. However, instruction tuning data is often quantity-saturated due to the large volume of data collection and fast model iteration, leaving coreset data selection important but underexplored. On the other hand, existing quality-driven data selection methods such as LIMA (NeurIPS 2023 (Zhou et al., 2024)) and AlpaGasus (ICLR 2024 (Chen et al.)) generally ignore the equal importance of data diversity and complexity. In this work, we aim to design a diversity-aware data selection strategy and creatively propose using sparse autoencoders to tackle the challenge of data diversity measure. In addition, sparse autoencoders can also provide more interpretability of model behavior and explain, e.g., the surprising effectiveness of selecting the longest response (ICML 2024 (Zhao et al.)). Using effective data selection, we experimentally prove that models trained on our selected data can outperform other methods in terms of model capabilities, reduce training cost, and potentially gain more control over model behaviors.</description>

      <title>RocketKV: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Two-Stage KV Cache Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on KV cache to efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy designed specifically to reduce both memory bandwidth and capacity demand of KV cache during the decode phase. RocketKV contains two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens with SnapKV++, a method improved upon SnapKV by introducing adaptive pooling size and full compatibility with grouped-query attention. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensional reductions. Combining these two stages, RocketKV achieves significant KV cache fetching bandwidth and storage savings while maintaining comparable accuracy to full KV cache attention. We show that RocketKV provides end-to-end speedup by up to 3$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction by up to 31% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA H100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks.</description>

      <title>New Lower Bounds for Stochastic Non-Convex Optimization through Divergence Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fundamental limits of first-order stochastic optimization in a range of nonconvex settings, including L-smooth functions satisfying Quasar-Convexity (QC), Quadratic Growth (QG), and Restricted Secant Inequalities (RSI). While the convergence properties of standard algorithms are well-understood in deterministic regimes, significantly fewer results address the stochastic case, where only unbiased and noisy gradients are available. We establish new lower bounds on the number of noisy gradient queries to minimize these classes of functions, also showing that they are tight (up to a logarithmic factor) in all the relevant quantities characterizing each class. Our approach reformulates the optimization task as a function identification problem, leveraging divergence composition arguments to construct a challenging subclass that leads to sharp lower bounds. Furthermore, we present a specialized algorithm in the one-dimensional setting that achieves faster rates, suggesting that certain dimensional thresholds are intrinsic to the complexity of non-convex stochastic optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In industrial applications requiring real-time feedback, such as quality control and robotic manipulation, the demand for high-speed and accurate pose estimation remains critical. Despite advances improving speed and accuracy in pose estimation, finding a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy poses significant challenges in dynamic environments. Most current algorithms lack scalability in estimation time, especially for diverse datasets, and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are often too slow. This study focuses on developing a fast and scalable set of pose estimators based on GDRNPP to meet or exceed current benchmarks in accuracy and robustness, particularly addressing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off essential in real-time scenarios. We propose the AMIS algorithm to tailor the utilized model according to an application-specific trade-off between inference time and accuracy. We further show the effectiveness of the AMIS-based model choice on four prominent benchmark datasets (LM-O, YCB-V, T-LESS, and ITODD).</description>

      <title>Investigating Non-Transitivity in LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic evaluation methods based on large language models (LLMs) are emerging as the standard tool for assessing the instruction-following abilities of LLM-based agents. The most common method in this paradigm, pairwise comparisons with a baseline model, critically depends on the assumption of transitive preferences. However, the validity of this assumption remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the presence of non-transitivity within the AlpacaEval framework and analyze its effects on model rankings. We find that LLM judges exhibit non-transitive preferences, leading to rankings that are sensitive to the choice of the baseline model. To mitigate this issue, we show that round-robin tournaments combined with Bradley-Terry models of preference can produce more reliable rankings. Notably, our method increases both the Spearman correlation and the Kendall correlation with Chatbot Arena (95.0% -&gt; 96.4% and 82.1% -&gt; 86.3% respectively). To address the computational cost of round-robin tournaments, we propose Swiss-Wise Iterative Matchmaking (Swim) tournaments, using a dynamic matching strategy to capture the benefits of round-robin tournaments while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Population Dynamics Control with Partial Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of controlling population dynamics, a class of linear dynamical systems evolving on the probability simplex, from the perspective of online non-stochastic control. While Golowich et.al. 2024 analyzed the fully observable setting, we focus on the more realistic, partially observable case, where only a low-dimensional representation of the state is accessible.
  In classical non-stochastic control, inputs are set as linear combinations of past disturbances. However, under partial observations, disturbances cannot be directly computed. To address this, Simchowitz et.al. 2020 proposed to construct oblivious signals, which are counterfactual observations with zero control, as a substitute. This raises several challenges in our setting: (1) how to construct oblivious signals under simplex constraints, where zero control is infeasible; (2) how to design a sufficiently expressive convex controller parameterization tailored to these signals; and (3) how to enforce the simplex constraint on control when projections may break the convexity of cost functions.
  Our main contribution is a new controller that achieves the optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with respect to a natural class of mixing linear dynamic controllers. To tackle these challenges, we construct signals based on hypothetical observations under a constant control adapted to the simplex domain, and introduce a new controller parameterization that approximates general control policies linear in non-oblivious observations. Furthermore, we employ a novel convex extension surrogate loss, inspired by Lattimore 2024, to bypass the projection-induced convexity issue.</description>

      <title>CND-IDS: Continual Novelty Detection for Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a crucial role in IoT and network security by monitoring system data and alerting to suspicious activities. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution for IDS, offering highly accurate intrusion detection. However, ML-IDS solutions often overlook two critical aspects needed to build reliable systems: continually changing data streams and a lack of attack labels. Streaming network traffic and associated cyber attacks are continually changing, which can degrade the performance of deployed ML models. Labeling attack data, such as zero-day attacks, in real-world intrusion scenarios may not be feasible, making the use of ML solutions that do not rely on attack labels necessary. To address both these challenges, we propose CND-IDS, a continual novelty detection IDS framework which consists of (i) a learning-based feature extractor that continuously updates new feature representations of the system data, and (ii) a novelty detector that identifies new cyber attacks by leveraging principal component analysis (PCA) reconstruction. Our results on realistic intrusion datasets show that CND-IDS achieves up to 6.1x F-score improvement, and up to 6.5x improved forward transfer over the SOTA unsupervised continual learning algorithm. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction under L\'evy-Prokhorov Distribution Shifts: Robustness to Local and Global Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a powerful framework for constructing prediction intervals with finite-sample guarantees, yet its robustness under distribution shifts remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses this limitation by modeling distribution shifts using L\'evy-Prokhorov (LP) ambiguity sets, which capture both local and global perturbations. We provide a self-contained overview of LP ambiguity sets and their connections to popular metrics such as Wasserstein and Total Variation. We show that the link between conformal prediction and LP ambiguity sets is a natural one: by propagating the LP ambiguity set through the scoring function, we reduce complex high-dimensional distribution shifts to manageable one-dimensional distribution shifts, enabling exact quantification of worst-case quantiles and coverage. Building on this analysis, we construct robust conformal prediction intervals that remain valid under distribution shifts, explicitly linking LP parameters to interval width and confidence levels. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization for Networked Black-Box Systems: A Path to Greener Profits and Smarter Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing modern industrial systems requires balancing several competing objectives, such as profitability, resilience, and sustainability, while accounting for complex interactions between technological, economic, and environmental factors. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are commonly used to navigate these tradeoffs, but selecting the appropriate algorithm to tackle these problems is often unclear, particularly when system representations vary from fully equation-based (white-box) to entirely data-driven (black-box) models. While grey-box MOO methods attempt to bridge this gap, they typically impose rigid assumptions on system structure, requiring models to conform to the underlying structural assumptions of the solver rather than the solver adapting to the natural representation of the system of interest. In this chapter, we introduce a unifying approach to grey-box MOO by leveraging network representations, which provide a general and flexible framework for modeling interconnected systems as a series of function nodes that share various inputs and outputs. Specifically, we propose MOBONS, a novel Bayesian optimization-inspired algorithm that can efficiently optimize general function networks, including those with cyclic dependencies, enabling the modeling of feedback loops, recycle streams, and multi-scale simulations - features that existing methods fail to capture. Furthermore, MOBONS incorporates constraints, supports parallel evaluations, and preserves the sample efficiency of Bayesian optimization while leveraging network structure for improved scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MOBONS through two case studies, including one related to sustainable process design. By enabling efficient MOO under general graph representations, MOBONS has the potential to significantly enhance the design of more profitable, resilient, and sustainable engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Risks from Advanced AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of advanced AI agents and the imminent deployment of many instances of these agents will give rise to multi-agent systems of unprecedented complexity. These systems pose novel and under-explored risks. In this report, we provide a structured taxonomy of these risks by identifying three key failure modes (miscoordination, conflict, and collusion) based on agents' incentives, as well as seven key risk factors (information asymmetries, network effects, selection pressures, destabilising dynamics, commitment problems, emergent agency, and multi-agent security) that can underpin them. We highlight several important instances of each risk, as well as promising directions to help mitigate them. By anchoring our analysis in a range of real-world examples and experimental evidence, we illustrate the distinct challenges posed by multi-agent systems and their implications for the safety, governance, and ethics of advanced AI.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study inverse game theory (resp. inverse multiagent learning) in which the goal is to find parameters of a game's payoff functions for which the expected (resp. sampled) behavior is an equilibrium. We formulate these problems as generative-adversarial (i.e., min-max) optimization problems, for which we develop polynomial-time algorithms to solve, the former of which relies on an exact first-order oracle, and the latter, a stochastic one. We extend our approach to solve inverse multiagent simulacral learning in polynomial time and number of samples. In these problems, we seek a simulacrum, meaning parameters and an associated equilibrium that replicate the given observations in expectation. We find that our approach outperforms the widely-used ARIMA method in predicting prices in Spanish electricity markets based on time-series data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a powerful framework for enhancing statistical estimates by combining limited gold-standard data with machine learning (ML) predictions. While prior work has demonstrated PPI's benefits for individual statistical tasks, modern applications require answering numerous parallel statistical questions. We introduce Prediction-Powered Adaptive Shrinkage (PAS), a method that bridges PPI with empirical Bayes shrinkage to improve the estimation of multiple means. PAS debiases noisy ML predictions within each task and then borrows strength across tasks by using those same predictions as a reference point for shrinkage. The amount of shrinkage is determined by minimizing an unbiased estimate of risk, and we prove that this tuning strategy is asymptotically optimal. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that PAS adapts to the reliability of the ML predictions and outperforms traditional and modern baselines in large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Distributional TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the finite-sample statistical rates of distributional temporal difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation. The aim of distributional TD learning is to estimate the return distribution of a discounted Markov decision process for a given policy {\pi}. Prior works on statistical analysis of distributional TD learning mainly focus on the tabular case. In contrast, we first consider the linear function approximation setting and derive sharp finite-sample rates. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the sample complexity of linear distributional TD learning matches that of the classic linear TD learning. This implies that, with linear function approximation, learning the full distribution of the return using streaming data is no more difficult than learning its expectation (i.e. the value function). To derive tight sample complexity bounds, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the linear-categorical Bellman equation, and employ the exponential stability arguments for products of random matrices. Our findings provide new insights into the statistical efficiency of distributional reinforcement learning algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We solve a regularized weighted low-rank approximation problem by a stochastic gradient descent on a manifold. To guarantee the convergence of our stochastic gradient descent, we establish a convergence theorem on manifolds for retraction-based stochastic gradient descents admitting confinements. On sample data from the Netflix Prize training dataset, our algorithm outperforms the existing stochastic gradient descent on Euclidean spaces. We also compare the accelerated line search on this manifold to the existing accelerated line search on Euclidean spaces.</description>

Abstract: The lifecycle of large language models (LLMs) is far more complex than that of traditional machine learning models, involving multiple training stages, diverse data sources, and varied inference methods. While prior research on data poisoning attacks has primarily focused on the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs, these attacks face significant challenges in practice. Secure data collection, rigorous data cleaning, and the multistage nature of LLM training make it difficult to inject poisoned data or reliably influence LLM behavior as intended. Given these challenges, this position paper proposes rethinking the role of data poisoning and argue that multi-faceted studies on data poisoning can advance LLM development. From a threat perspective, practical strategies for data poisoning attacks can help evaluate and address real safety risks to LLMs. From a trustworthiness perspective, data poisoning can be leveraged to build more robust LLMs by uncovering and mitigating hidden biases, harmful outputs, and hallucinations. Moreover, from a mechanism perspective, data poisoning can provide valuable insights into LLMs, particularly the interplay between data and model behavior, driving a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Bayesian SegNet for Semantic Segmentation with Improved Interpretation of Microstructural Evolution During Irradiation of Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between the evolution of microstructures of irradiated LiAlO2 pellets and tritium diffusion, retention and release could improve predictions of tritium-producing burnable absorber rod performance. Given expert-labeled segmented images of irradiated and unirradiated pellets, we trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to segment images into defect, grain, and boundary classes. Qualitative microstructural information was calculated from these segmented images to facilitate the comparison of unirradiated and irradiated pellets. We tested modifications to improve the sensitivity of the model, including incorporating meta-data into the model and utilizing uncertainty quantification. The predicted segmentation was similar to the expert-labeled segmentation for most methods of microstructural qualification, including pixel proportion, defect area, and defect density. Overall, the high performance metrics for the best models for both irradiated and unirradiated images shows that utilizing neural network models is a viable alternative to expert-labeled images.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Consider Security? An Empirical Study on Responses to Programming Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of conversational LLMs for software development has raised new security concerns regarding the safety of LLM-generated content. Our motivational study outlines ChatGPT's potential in volunteering context-specific information to the developers, promoting safe coding practices. Motivated by this finding, we conduct a study to evaluate the degree of security awareness exhibited by three prominent LLMs: Claude 3, GPT-4, and Llama 3. We prompt these LLMs with Stack Overflow questions that contain vulnerable code to evaluate whether they merely provide answers to the questions or if they also warn users about the insecure code, thereby demonstrating a degree of security awareness. Further, we assess whether LLM responses provide information about the causes, exploits, and the potential fixes of the vulnerability, to help raise users' awareness. Our findings show that all three models struggle to accurately detect and warn users about vulnerabilities, achieving a detection rate of only 12.6% to 40% across our datasets. We also observe that the LLMs tend to identify certain types of vulnerabilities related to sensitive information exposure and improper input neutralization much more frequently than other types, such as those involving external control of file names or paths. Furthermore, when LLMs do issue security warnings, they often provide more information on the causes, exploits, and fixes of vulnerabilities compared to Stack Overflow responses. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion on the implications of our findings and present a CLI-based prompting tool that can be used to generate significantly more secure LLM responses.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Linear Quadratic Regulator Without Initial Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by REINFORCE, we introduce a novel receding-horizon algorithm for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem with unknown parameters. Unlike prior methods, our algorithm avoids reliance on two-point gradient estimates while maintaining the same order of sample complexity. Furthermore, it eliminates the restrictive requirement of starting with a stable initial policy, broadening its applicability. Beyond these improvements, we introduce a refined analysis of error propagation through the contraction of the Riemannian distance over the Riccati operator. This refinement leads to a better sample complexity and ensures improved convergence guarantees. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results, demonstrating the method's practical feasibility and performance in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Sampling-based Online Planning for Drone Interception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies high-speed online planning in dynamic environments. The problem requires finding time-optimal trajectories that conform to system dynamics, meeting computational constraints for real-time adaptation, and accounting for uncertainty from environmental changes. To address these challenges, we propose a sampling-based online planning algorithm that leverages neural network inference to replace time-consuming nonlinear trajectory optimization, enabling rapid exploration of multiple trajectory options under uncertainty. The proposed method is applied to the drone interception problem, where a defense drone must intercept a target while avoiding collisions and handling imperfect target predictions. The algorithm efficiently generates trajectories toward multiple potential target drone positions in parallel. It then assesses trajectory reachability by comparing traversal times with the target drone's predicted arrival time, ultimately selecting the minimum-time reachable trajectory. Through extensive validation in both simulated and real-world environments, we demonstrate our method's capability for high-rate online planning and its adaptability to unpredictable movements in unstructured settings.</description>

      <title>OBELiX: A Curated Dataset of Crystal Structures and Experimentally Measured Ionic Conductivities for Lithium Solid-State Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolyte batteries are expected to replace liquid electrolyte lithium-ion batteries in the near future thanks to their higher theoretical energy density and improved safety. However, their adoption is currently hindered by their lower effective ionic conductivity, a quantity that governs charge and discharge rates. Identifying highly ion-conductive materials using conventional theoretical calculations and experimental validation is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. While machine learning holds the promise to expedite this process, relevant ionic conductivity and structural data is scarce. Here, we present OBELiX, a domain-expert-curated database of $\sim$600 synthesized solid electrolyte materials and their experimentally measured room temperature ionic conductivities gathered from literature. Each material is described by their measured composition, space group and lattice parameters. A full-crystal description in the form of a crystallographic information file (CIF) is provided for ~320 structures for which atomic positions were available. We discuss various statistics and features of the dataset and provide training and testing splits that avoid data leakage. Finally, we benchmark seven existing ML models on the task of predicting ionic conductivity and discuss their performance. The goal of this work is to facilitate the use of machine learning for solid-state electrolyte materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Towards efficient quantum algorithms for diffusion probability models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) is a generative model renowned for its ability to produce high-quality outputs in tasks such as image and audio generation. However, training DPMs on large, high-dimensional datasets such as high-resolution images or audio incurs significant computational, energy, and hardware costs. In this work, we introduce efficient quantum algorithms for implementing DPMs through various quantum ODE solvers. These algorithms highlight the potential of quantum Carleman linearization for diverse mathematical structures, leveraging state-of-the-art quantum linear system solvers (QLSS) or linear combination of Hamiltonian simulations (LCHS). Specifically, we focus on two approaches: DPM-solver-$k$ which employs exact $k$-th order derivatives to compute a polynomial approximation of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$; and UniPC which uses finite difference of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$ at different points $(x_{s_m}, \lambda_{s_m})$ to approximate higher-order derivatives. As such, this work represents one of the most direct and pragmatic applications of quantum algorithms to large-scale machine learning models, presumably talking substantial steps towards demonstrating the practical utility of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Effects of Prompt Length on Domain-specific Tasks for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models have garnered significant attention for their strong performance in various natural language tasks, such as machine translation and question answering. These models demonstrate an impressive ability to generalize across diverse tasks. However, their effectiveness in tackling domain-specific tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis and monetary policy understanding, remains a topic of debate, as these tasks often require specialized knowledge and precise reasoning. To address such challenges, researchers design various prompts to unlock the models' abilities. By carefully crafting input prompts, researchers can guide these models to produce more accurate responses. Consequently, prompt engineering has become a key focus of study. Despite the advancements in both models and prompt engineering, the relationship between the two-specifically, how prompt design impacts models' ability to perform domain-specific tasks-remains underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this research gap.</description>

      <title>Fact or Guesswork? Evaluating Large Language Model's Medical Knowledge with Structured One-Hop Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in various downstream task domains. However, their ability to directly recall and apply factual medical knowledge remains under-explored. Most existing medical QA benchmarks assess complex reasoning or multi-hop inference, making it difficult to isolate LLMs' inherent medical knowledge from their reasoning capabilities. Given the high-stakes nature of medical applications, where incorrect information can have critical consequences, it is essential to evaluate how well LLMs encode, retain, and recall fundamental medical facts.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce the Medical Knowledge Judgment, a dataset specifically designed to measure LLMs' one-hop factual medical knowledge. MKJ is constructed from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a large-scale repository of standardized biomedical vocabularies and knowledge graphs. We frame knowledge assessment as a binary judgment task, requiring LLMs to verify the correctness of medical statements extracted from reliable and structured knowledge sources.
  Our experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with factual medical knowledge retention, exhibiting significant performance variance across different semantic categories, particularly for rare medical conditions. Furthermore, LLMs show poor calibration, often being overconfident in incorrect answers. To mitigate these issues, we explore retrieval-augmented generation, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving factual accuracy and reducing uncertainty in medical decision-making.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of Sakana's AI Scientist for Autonomous Research: Wishful Thinking or an Emerging Reality Towards 'Artificial General Research Intelligence' (AGRI)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Super Intelligence is AI's ability to autonomously conduct research - what we term Artificial General Research Intelligence (AGRI). If machines could generate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and write research papers without human intervention, it would transform science. Recently, Sakana.ai introduced the AI Scientist, a system claiming to automate the research lifecycle, generating both excitement and skepticism.
  We evaluated the AI Scientist and found it a milestone in AI-driven research. While it streamlines some aspects, it falls short of expectations. Literature reviews are weak, nearly half the experiments failed, and manuscripts sometimes contain hallucinated results. Most notably, users must provide an experimental pipeline, limiting the AI Scientist's autonomy in research design and execution.
  Despite its limitations, the AI Scientist advances research automation. Many reviewers or instructors who assess work superficially may not recognize its output as AI-generated. The system produces research papers with minimal human effort and low cost. Our analysis suggests a paper costs a few USD with a few hours of human involvement, making it significantly faster than human researchers. Compared to AI capabilities from a few years ago, this marks progress toward AGRI.
  The rise of AI-driven research systems requires urgent discussion within Information Retrieval (IR) and broader scientific communities. Enhancing literature retrieval, citation validation, and evaluation benchmarks could improve AI-generated research reliability. We propose concrete steps, including AGRI-specific benchmarks, refined peer review, and standardized attribution frameworks. Whether AGRI becomes a stepping stone to AGI depends on how the academic and AI communities shape its development.</description>

      <title>MedHallu: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Detecting Medical Hallucinations in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increasing use in medical question-answering necessitate rigorous evaluation of their reliability. A critical challenge lies in hallucination, where models generate plausible yet factually incorrect outputs. In the medical domain, this poses serious risks to patient safety and clinical decision-making. To address this, we introduce MedHallu, the first benchmark specifically designed for medical hallucination detection. MedHallu comprises 10,000 high-quality question-answer pairs derived from PubMedQA, with hallucinated answers systematically generated through a controlled pipeline. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, and the medically fine-tuned UltraMedical, struggle with this binary hallucination detection task, with the best model achieving an F1 score as low as 0.625 for detecting "hard" category hallucinations. Using bidirectional entailment clustering, we show that harder-to-detect hallucinations are semantically closer to ground truth. Through experiments, we also show incorporating domain-specific knowledge and introducing a "not sure" category as one of the answer categories improves the precision and F1 scores by up to 38% relative to baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of industrial applications, from search and recommendations to generative tasks. Although scaling laws indicate that larger models generally yield better generalization and performance, their substantial computational requirements often render them impractical for many real-world scenarios at scale. In this paper, we present methods and insights for training small language models (SLMs) that deliver high performance and efficiency in deployment. We focus on two key techniques: (1) knowledge distillation and (2) model compression via quantization and pruning. These approaches enable SLMs to retain much of the quality of their larger counterparts while significantly reducing training, serving costs, and latency. We detail the impact of these techniques on a variety of use cases at a large professional social network platform and share deployment lessons - including hardware optimization strategies that enhance speed and throughput for both predictive and reasoning-based applications.</description>

      <title>{\mu}RL: Discovering Transient Execution Vulnerabilities Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using reinforcement learning to address the challenges of discovering microarchitectural vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown, which exploit subtle interactions in modern processors. Traditional methods like random fuzzing fail to efficiently explore the vast instruction space and often miss vulnerabilities that manifest under specific conditions. To overcome this, we introduce an intelligent, feedback-driven approach using RL. Our RL agents interact with the processor, learning from real-time feedback to prioritize instruction sequences more likely to reveal vulnerabilities, significantly improving the efficiency of the discovery process.
  We also demonstrate that RL systems adapt effectively to various microarchitectures, providing a scalable solution across processor generations. By automating the exploration process, we reduce the need for human intervention, enabling continuous learning that uncovers hidden vulnerabilities. Additionally, our approach detects subtle signals, such as timing anomalies or unusual cache behavior, that may indicate microarchitectural weaknesses. This proposal advances hardware security testing by introducing a more efficient, adaptive, and systematic framework for protecting modern processors.
  When unleashed on Intel Skylake-X and Raptor Lake microarchitectures, our RL agent was indeed able to generate instruction sequences that cause significant observable byte leakages through transient execution without generating any $\mu$code assists, faults or interrupts. The newly identified leaky sequences stem from a variety of Intel instructions, e.g. including SERIALIZE, VERR/VERW, CLMUL, MMX-x87 transitions, LSL+RDSCP and LAR. These initial results give credence to the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Line Goes Up? Inherent Limitations of Benchmarks for Evaluating Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) regularly demonstrate new and impressive performance on a wide range of language, knowledge, and reasoning benchmarks. Such rapid progress has led many commentators to argue that LLM general cognitive capabilities have likewise rapidly improved, with the implication that such models are becoming progressively more capable on various real-world tasks. Here I summarise theoretical and empirical considerations to challenge this narrative. I argue that inherent limitations with the benchmarking paradigm, along with specific limitations of existing benchmarks, render benchmark performance highly unsuitable as a metric for generalisable competence over cognitive tasks. I also contend that alternative methods for assessing LLM capabilities, including adversarial stimuli and interpretability techniques, have shown that LLMs do not have robust competence in many language and reasoning tasks, and often fail to learn representations which facilitate generalisable inferences. I conclude that benchmark performance should not be used as a reliable indicator of general LLM cognitive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Optimize Cardinality Estimation Model Pretraining by Simplifying the Training Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cardinality estimation is a key aspect of query optimization research, and its performance has significantly improved with the integration of machine learning. To overcome the "cold start" problem or the lack of model transferability in learned cardinality estimators, some pre-training cardinality estimation models have been proposed that use learning across multiple datasets and corresponding workloads. These models typically train on a dataset created by uniformly sampling from many datasets, but this approach may not be optimal. By applying the Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (Group DRO) algorithm to training datasets, we find that some specific training datasets contribute more significantly to model performance than others. Based on this observation, we conduct extensive experiments to delve deeper into pre-training cardinality estimators. Our results show how the performance of these models can be influenced by the datasets and corresponding workloads. Finally, we introduce a simplified training dataset, which has been reduced to a fraction of the size of existing pretraining datasets. Sufficient experimental results demonstrate that the pre-trained cardinality estimator based on this simplified dataset can still achieve comparable performance to existing models in zero-shot setups.</description>

      <title>Discovering highly efficient low-weight quantum error-correcting codes with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing is expected to hinge on quantum error-correcting codes. In the quest for more efficient quantum fault tolerance, a critical code parameter is the weight of measurements that extract information about errors to enable error correction: as higher measurement weights require higher implementation costs and introduce more errors, it is important in code design to optimize measurement weight. This underlies the surging interest in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, the study of which has primarily focused on the asymptotic (large-code-limit) properties. In this work, we introduce a versatile and computationally efficient approach to stabilizer code weight reduction based on reinforcement learning (RL), which produces new low-weight codes that substantially outperform the state of the art in practically relevant parameter regimes, extending significantly beyond previously accessible small distances. For example, our approach demonstrates savings in physical qubit overhead compared to existing results by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude for weight 6 codes and brings the overhead into a feasible range for near-future experiments. We also investigate the interplay between code parameters using our RL framework, offering new insights into the potential efficiency and power of practically viable coding strategies. Overall, our results demonstrate how RL can effectively advance the crucial yet challenging problem of quantum code discovery and thereby facilitate a faster path to the practical implementation of fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Affinity and Diversity: A Unified Metric for Demonstration Selection via Internal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of In-Context Learning (ICL) is highly sensitive to the selected demonstrations. Existing approaches to demonstration selection optimize different objectives, yielding inconsistent results. To address this, we propose a unified metric--affinity and diversity--that leverages ICL model's internal representations. Our experiments show that both affinity and diversity strongly correlate with test accuracies, indicating their effectiveness for demonstration selection. Moreover, we show that our proposed metrics align well with various previous works to unify the inconsistency.</description>

      <title>A Macro- and Micro-Hierarchical Transfer Learning Framework for Cross-Domain Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain fake news detection aims to mitigate domain shift and improve detection performance by transferring knowledge across domains. Existing approaches transfer knowledge based on news content and user engagements from a source domain to a target domain. However, these approaches face two main limitations, hindering effective knowledge transfer and optimal fake news detection performance. Firstly, from a micro perspective, they neglect the negative impact of veracity-irrelevant features in news content when transferring domain-shared features across domains. Secondly, from a macro perspective, existing approaches ignore the relationship between user engagement and news content, which reveals shared behaviors of common users across domains and can facilitate more effective knowledge transfer. To address these limitations, we propose a novel macro- and micro- hierarchical transfer learning framework (MMHT) for cross-domain fake news detection. Firstly, we propose a micro-hierarchical disentangling module to disentangle veracity-relevant and veracity-irrelevant features from news content in the source domain for improving fake news detection performance in the target domain. Secondly, we propose a macro-hierarchical transfer learning module to generate engagement features based on common users' shared behaviors in different domains for improving effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Precise Geolocation Inference Capabilities of Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) raises important questions about privacy in an era where visual information is increasingly available. While foundation VLMs demonstrate broad knowledge and learned capabilities, we specifically investigate their ability to infer geographic location from previously unseen image data. This paper introduces a benchmark dataset collected from Google Street View that represents its global distribution of coverage. Foundation models are evaluated on single-image geolocation inference, with many achieving median distance errors of &lt;300 km. We further evaluate VLM "agents" with access to supplemental tools, observing up to a 30.6% decrease in distance error. Our findings establish that modern foundation VLMs can act as powerful image geolocation tools, without being specifically trained for this task. When coupled with increasing accessibility of these models, our findings have greater implications for online privacy. We discuss these risks, as well as future work in this area.</description>

      <title>Reliable Explainability of Deep Learning Spatial-Spectral Classifiers for Improved Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating hyperspectral imagery (HSI) with deep neural networks (DNNs) can strengthen the accuracy of intelligent vision systems by combining spectral and spatial information, which is useful for tasks like semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To advance research in such safety-critical systems, determining the precise contribution of spectral information to complex DNNs' output is needed. To address this, several saliency methods, such as class activation maps (CAM), have been proposed primarily for image classification. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding their reliability. In this paper, we address their limitations and propose an alternative approach by leveraging the data provided by activations and weights from relevant DNN layers to better capture the relationship between input features and predictions. The study aims to assess the superior performance of HSI compared to 3-channel and single-channel DNNs. We also address the influence of spectral signature normalization for enhancing DNN robustness in real-world driving conditions.</description>

      <title>ChatVLA: Unified Multimodal Understanding and Robot Control with Vision-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans possess a unified cognitive ability to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. Why can't large language models replicate this holistic understanding? Through a systematic analysis of existing training paradigms in vision-language-action models (VLA), we identify two key challenges: spurious forgetting, where robot training overwrites crucial visual-text alignments, and task interference, where competing control and understanding tasks degrade performance when trained jointly. To overcome these limitations, we propose ChatVLA, a novel framework featuring Phased Alignment Training, which incrementally integrates multimodal data after initial control mastery, and a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to minimize task interference. ChatVLA demonstrates competitive performance on visual question-answering datasets and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) methods on multimodal understanding benchmarks. Notably, it achieves a six times higher performance on MMMU and scores 47.2% on MMStar with a more parameter-efficient design than ECoT. Furthermore, ChatVLA demonstrates superior performance on 25 real-world robot manipulation tasks compared to existing VLA methods like OpenVLA. Our findings highlight the potential of our unified framework for achieving both robust multimodal understanding and effective robot control.</description>

      <title>Distribution Matching for Self-Supervised Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised transfer learning method called Distribution Matching (DM), which drives the representation distribution toward a predefined reference distribution while preserving augmentation invariance. The design of DM results in a learned representation space that is intuitively structured and offers easily interpretable hyperparameters. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation metrics demonstrate that DM performs competitively on target classification tasks compared to existing self-supervised transfer learning methods. Additionally, we provide robust theoretical guarantees for DM, including a population theorem and an end-to-end sample theorem. The population theorem bridges the gap between the self-supervised learning task and target classification accuracy, while the sample theorem shows that, even with a limited number of samples from the target domain, DM can deliver exceptional classification performance, provided the unlabeled sample size is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Watch Less, Feel More: Sim-to-Real RL for Generalizable Articulated Object Manipulation via Motion Adaptation and Impedance Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Articulated object manipulation poses a unique challenge compared to rigid object manipulation as the object itself represents a dynamic environment. In this work, we present a novel RL-based pipeline equipped with variable impedance control and motion adaptation leveraging observation history for generalizable articulated object manipulation, focusing on smooth and dexterous motion during zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. To mitigate the sim-to-real gap, our pipeline diminishes reliance on vision by not leveraging the vision data feature (RGBD/pointcloud) directly as policy input but rather extracting useful low-dimensional data first via off-the-shelf modules. Additionally, we experience less sim-to-real gap by inferring object motion and its intrinsic properties via observation history as well as utilizing impedance control both in the simulation and in the real world. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed training setting with great randomization and a specialized reward system (task-aware and motion-aware) that enables multi-staged, end-to-end manipulation without heuristic motion planning. To the best of our knowledge, our policy is the first to report 84\% success rate in the real world via extensive experiments with various unseen objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flatbed scanners have emerged as promising devices for high-resolution, single-image material capture. However, existing approaches assume very specific conditions, such as uniform diffuse illumination, which are only available in certain high-end devices, hindering their scalability and cost. In contrast, in this work, we introduce a method inspired by intrinsic image decomposition, which accurately removes both shading and specularity, effectively allowing captures with any flatbed scanner. Further, we extend previous work on single-image material reflectance capture with the estimation of opacity and transmittance, critical components of full material appearance (SVBSDF), improving the results for any material captured with a flatbed scanner, at a very high resolution and accuracy</description>

      <title>Provable Quantum Algorithm Advantage for Gaussian Process Quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to develop novel quantum algorithms for Gaussian process quadrature methods. Gaussian process quadratures are numerical integration methods where Gaussian processes are used as functional priors for the integrands to capture the uncertainty arising from the sparse function evaluations. Quantum computers have emerged as potential replacements for classical computers, offering exponential reductions in the computational complexity of machine learning tasks. In this paper, we combine Gaussian process quadratures and quantum computing by proposing a quantum low-rank Gaussian process quadrature method based on a Hilbert space approximation of the Gaussian process kernel and enhancing the quadrature using a quantum circuit. The method combines the quantum phase estimation algorithm with the quantum principal component analysis technique to extract information up to a desired rank. Then, Hadamard and SWAP tests are implemented to find the expected value and variance that determines the quadrature. We use numerical simulations of a quantum computer to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical complexity analysis that shows a polynomial advantage over classical Gaussian process quadrature methods. The code is available at https://github.com/cagalvisf/Quantum_HSGPQ.</description>

      <title>CrossFuse: Learning Infrared and Visible Image Fusion by Cross-Sensor Top-K Vision Alignment and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is increasingly applied in critical fields such as video surveillance and autonomous driving systems. Significant progress has been made in deep learning-based fusion methods. However, these models frequently encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes in real-world applications, which severely impact their performance and reliability. Therefore, addressing the challenge of OOD data is crucial for the safe deployment of these models in open-world environments. Unlike existing research, our focus is on the challenges posed by OOD data in real-world applications and on enhancing the robustness and generalization of models. In this paper, we propose an infrared-visible fusion framework based on Multi-View Augmentation. For external data augmentation, Top-k Selective Vision Alignment is employed to mitigate distribution shifts between datasets by performing RGB-wise transformations on visible images. This strategy effectively introduces augmented samples, enhancing the adaptability of the model to complex real-world scenarios. Additionally, for internal data augmentation, self-supervised learning is established using Weak-Aggressive Augmentation. This enables the model to learn more robust and general feature representations during the fusion process, thereby improving robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance and robustness across various conditions and environments. Our approach significantly enhances the reliability and stability of IVIF tasks in practical applications.</description>

      <title>MLGym: A New Framework and Benchmark for Advancing AI Research Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Meta MLGym and MLGym-Bench, a new framework and benchmark for evaluating and developing LLM agents on AI research tasks. This is the first Gym environment for machine learning (ML) tasks, enabling research on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for training such agents. MLGym-bench consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from diverse domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory. Solving these tasks requires real-world AI research skills such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, training models, running experiments, analyzing the results, and iterating through this process to improve on a given task. We evaluate a number of frontier large language models (LLMs) on our benchmarks such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1 405B, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks. We find that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements. We open-source our framework and benchmark to facilitate future research in advancing the AI research capabilities of LLM agents.</description>

Abstract: The solution to empirical risk minimization with $f$-divergence regularization (ERM-$f$DR) is extended to constrained optimization problems, establishing conditions for equivalence between the solution and constraints. A dual formulation of ERM-$f$DR is introduced, providing a computationally efficient method to derive the normalization function of the ERM-$f$DR solution. This dual approach leverages the Legendre-Fenchel transform and the implicit function theorem, enabling explicit characterizations of the generalization error for general algorithms under mild conditions, and another for ERM-$f$DR solutions.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Byte Language Models -- A Hierarchical Architecture for Causal Million-Length Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bytes form the basis of the digital world and thus are a promising building block for multimodal foundation models. Recently, Byte Language Models (BLMs) have emerged to overcome tokenization, yet the excessive length of bytestreams requires new architectural paradigms. Therefore, we present the Multiscale Byte Language Model (MBLM), a model-agnostic hierarchical decoder stack that allows training with context windows of $5$M bytes on single GPU in full model precision. We thoroughly examine MBLM's performance with Transformer and Mamba blocks on both unimodal and multimodal tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that hybrid architectures are efficient in handling extremely long byte sequences during training while achieving near-linear generational efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first evaluation of BLMs on visual Q\&amp;A tasks and find that, despite serializing images and the absence of an encoder, a MBLM with pure next token prediction can match custom CNN-LSTM architectures with designated classification heads. We show that MBLMs exhibit strong adaptability in integrating diverse data representations, including pixel and image filestream bytes, underlining their potential toward omnimodal foundation models.

      <title>Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation Robust to Reflective Surface Leveraged by Triplet Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SSMDE) aims to predict the dense depth map of a monocular image, by learning depth from RGB image sequences, eliminating the need for ground-truth depth labels. Although this approach simplifies data acquisition compared to supervised methods, it struggles with reflective surfaces, as they violate the assumptions of Lambertian reflectance, leading to inaccurate training on such surfaces. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel training strategy for an SSMDE by leveraging triplet mining to pinpoint reflective regions at the pixel level, guided by the camera geometry between different viewpoints. The proposed reflection-aware triplet mining loss specifically penalizes the inappropriate photometric error minimization on the localized reflective regions while preserving depth accuracy in non-reflective areas. We also incorporate a reflection-aware knowledge distillation method that enables a student model to selectively learn the pixel-level knowledge from reflective and non-reflective regions. This results in robust depth estimation across areas. Evaluation results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method effectively enhances depth quality on reflective surfaces and outperforms state-of-the-art SSMDE baselines.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Case Against Empirical Human-AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical human-AI alignment aims to make AI systems act in line with observed human behavior. While noble in its goals, we argue that empirical alignment can inadvertently introduce statistical biases that warrant caution. This position paper thus advocates against naive empirical alignment, offering prescriptive alignment and a posteriori empirical alignment as alternatives. We substantiate our principled argument by tangible examples like human-centric decoding of language models.</description>

      <title>Confidence Estimation via Sequential Likelihood Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a universal framework for constructing confidence sets based on sequential likelihood mixing. Building upon classical results from sequential analysis, we provide a unifying perspective on several recent lines of work, and establish fundamental connections between sequential mixing, Bayesian inference and regret inequalities from online estimation. The framework applies to any realizable family of likelihood functions and allows for non-i.i.d. data and anytime validity. Moreover, the framework seamlessly integrates standard approximate inference techniques, such as variational inference and sampling-based methods, and extends to misspecified model classes, while preserving provable coverage guarantees. We illustrate the power of the framework by deriving tighter confidence sequences for classical settings, including sequential linear regression and sparse estimation, with simplified proofs.</description>

      <title>TRUSWorthy: Toward Clinically Applicable Deep Learning for Confident Detection of Prostate Cancer in Micro-Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep learning methods have shown great promise in improving the effectiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis by detecting suspicious lesions from trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS), they must overcome multiple simultaneous challenges. There is high heterogeneity in tissue appearance, significant class imbalance in favor of benign examples, and scarcity in the number and quality of ground truth annotations available to train models. Failure to address even a single one of these problems can result in unacceptable clinical outcomes.We propose TRUSWorthy, a carefully designed, tuned, and integrated system for reliable PCa detection. Our pipeline integrates self-supervised learning, multiple-instance learning aggregation using transformers, random-undersampled boosting and ensembling: these address label scarcity, weak labels, class imbalance, and overconfidence, respectively. We train and rigorously evaluate our method using a large, multi-center dataset of micro-ultrasound data. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of accuracy and uncertainty calibration, with AUROC and balanced accuracy scores of 79.9% and 71.5%, respectively. On the top 20% of predictions with the highest confidence, we can achieve a balanced accuracy of up to 91%. The success of TRUSWorthy demonstrates the potential of integrated deep learning solutions to meet clinical needs in a highly challenging deployment setting, and is a significant step towards creating a trustworthy system for computer-assisted PCa diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Pretraining with Group-Level Data Influence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-efficient pretraining has shown tremendous potential to elevate scaling laws. This paper argues that effective pretraining data should be curated at the group level, treating a set of data points as a whole rather than as independent contributors. To achieve that, we propose Group-Level Data Influence Modeling (Group-MATES), a novel data-efficient pretraining method that captures and optimizes group-level data utility. Specifically, Group-MATES collects oracle group-level influences by locally probing the pretraining model with data sets. It then fine-tunes a relational data influence model to approximate oracles as relationship-weighted aggregations of individual influences. The fine-tuned model selects the data subset by maximizing its group-level influence prediction, with influence-aware clustering to enable efficient inference. Experiments on the DCLM benchmark demonstrate that Group-MATES achieves a 10% relative core score improvement on 22 downstream tasks over DCLM-Baseline and 5% over individual-influence-based methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Further analyses highlight the effectiveness of relational data influence models in capturing intricate interactions between data points.</description>

      <title>Internal Incoherency Scores for Constraint-based Causal Discovery Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery aims to infer causal graphs from observational or experimental data. Methods such as the popular PC algorithm are based on conditional independence testing and utilize enabling assumptions, such as the faithfulness assumption, for their inferences. In practice, these assumptions, as well as the functional assumptions inherited from the chosen conditional independence test, are typically taken as a given and not further tested for their validity on the data. In this work, we propose internal coherency scores that allow testing for assumption violations and finite sample errors, whenever detectable without requiring ground truth or further statistical tests. We provide a complete classification of erroneous results, including a distinction between detectable and undetectable errors, and prove that the detectable erroneous results can be measured by our scores. We illustrate our coherency scores on the PC algorithm with simulated and real-world datasets, and envision that testing for internal coherency can become a standard tool in applying constraint-based methods, much like a suite of tests is used to validate the assumptions of classical regression analysis.</description>

      <title>Ranking Joint Policies in Dynamic Games using Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic solution concepts, such as the Nash equilibrium, have been key to finding stable joint actions in multi-player games. However, it has been shown that the dynamics of agents' interactions, even in simple two-player games with few strategies, are incapable of reaching Nash equilibria, exhibiting complex and unpredictable behavior. Instead, evolutionary approaches can describe the long-term persistence of strategies and filter out transient ones, accounting for the long-term dynamics of agents' interactions. Our goal is to identify agents' joint strategies that result in stable behavior, being resistant to changes, while also accounting for agents' payoffs, in dynamic games. Towards this goal, and building on previous results, this paper proposes transforming dynamic games into their empirical forms by considering agents' strategies instead of agents' actions, and applying the evolutionary methodology $\alpha$-Rank to evaluate and rank strategy profiles according to their long-term dynamics. This methodology not only allows us to identify joint strategies that are strong through agents' long-term interactions, but also provides a descriptive, transparent framework regarding the high ranking of these strategies. Experiments report on agents that aim to collaboratively solve a stochastic version of the graph coloring problem. We consider different styles of play as strategies to define the empirical game, and train policies realizing these strategies, using the DQN algorithm. Then we run simulations to generate the payoff matrix required by $\alpha$-Rank to rank joint strategies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Performance Scores: Directed Functional Connectivity as a Brain-Based Biomarker for Motor Skill Learning and Retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motor skill acquisition in fields like surgery, robotics, and sports involves learning complex task sequences through extensive training. Traditional performance metrics, like execution time and error rates, offer limited insight as they fail to capture the neural mechanisms underlying skill learning and retention. This study introduces directed functional connectivity (dFC), derived from electroencephalography (EEG), as a novel brain-based biomarker for assessing motor skill learning and retention. For the first time, dFC is applied as a biomarker to map the stages of the Fitts and Posner motor learning model, offering new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying skill acquisition and retention. Unlike traditional measures, it captures both the strength and direction of neural information flow, providing a comprehensive understanding of neural adaptations across different learning stages. The analysis demonstrates that dFC can effectively identify and track the progression through various stages of the Fitts and Posner model. Furthermore, its stability over a six-week washout period highlights its utility in monitoring long-term retention. No significant changes in dFC were observed in a control group, confirming that the observed neural adaptations were specific to training and not due to external factors. By offering a granular view of the learning process at the group and individual levels, dFC facilitates the development of personalized, targeted training protocols aimed at enhancing outcomes in fields where precision and long-term retention are critical, such as surgical education. These findings underscore the value of dFC as a robust biomarker that complements traditional performance metrics, providing a deeper understanding of motor skill learning and retention.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Graph Attention for Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Lightpath Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many works have investigated reinforcement learning (RL) for routing and spectrum assignment on flex-grid networks but only one work to date has examined RL for fixed-grid with flex-rate transponders, despite production systems using this paradigm. Flex-rate transponders allow existing lightpaths to accommodate new services, a task we term routing and wavelength assignment with lightpath reuse (RWA-LR). We re-examine this problem and present a thorough benchmarking of heuristic algorithms for RWA-LR, which are shown to have 6% increased throughput when candidate paths are ordered by number of hops, rather than total length. We train an RL agent for RWA-LR with graph attention networks for the policy and value functions to exploit the graph-structured data. We provide details of our methodology and open source all of our code for reproduction. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art RL approach by 2.5% (17.4 Tbps mean additional throughput) and the best heuristic by 1.2% (8.5 Tbps mean additional throughput). This marginal gain highlights the difficulty in learning effective RL policies on long horizon resource allocation tasks.</description>

Abstract: We consider machine learning models, learned from data, to be an important, intensional, kind of data in themselves. As such, various analysis tasks on models can be thought of as queries over this intensional data, often combined with extensional data such as data for training or validation. We demonstrate that relational database systems and SQL can actually be well suited for many such tasks.</description>

      <title>TritonBench: Benchmarking Large Language Model Capabilities for Generating Triton Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triton, a high-level Python-like language designed for building efficient GPU kernels, is widely adopted in deep learning frameworks due to its portability, flexibility, and accessibility. However, programming and parallel optimization still require considerable trial and error from Triton developers. Despite advances in large language models (LLMs) for conventional code generation, these models struggle to generate accurate, performance-optimized Triton code, as they lack awareness of its specifications and the complexities of GPU programming. More critically, there is an urgent need for systematic evaluations tailored to Triton. In this work, we introduce TritonBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for Triton operator generation. TritonBench features two evaluation channels: a curated set of 184 real-world operators from GitHub and a collection of operators aligned with PyTorch interfaces. Unlike conventional code benchmarks prioritizing functional correctness, TritonBench also profiles efficiency performance on widely deployed GPUs aligned with industry applications. Our study reveals that current state-of-the-art code LLMs struggle to generate efficient Triton operators, highlighting a significant gap in high-performance code generation. TritonBench will be available at https://github.com/thunlp/TritonBench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In decision-making problems, the outcome of an intervention often depends on the causal relationships between system components and is highly costly to evaluate. In such settings, causal Bayesian optimization (CBO) can exploit the causal relationships between the system variables and sequentially perform interventions to approach the optimum with minimal data. Extending CBO to the multi-outcome setting, we propose Multi-Objective Causal Bayesian Optimization (MO-CBO), a paradigm for identifying Pareto-optimal interventions within a known multi-target causal graph. We first derive a graphical characterization for potentially optimal sets of variables to intervene upon. Showing that any MO-CBO problem can be decomposed into several traditional multi-objective optimization tasks, we then introduce an algorithm that sequentially balances exploration across these tasks using relative hypervolume improvement. The proposed method will be validated on both synthetic and real-world causal graphs, demonstrating its superiority over traditional (non-causal) multi-objective Bayesian optimization in settings where causal information is available.</description>

      <title>EquivaMap: Leveraging LLMs for Automatic Equivalence Checking of Optimization Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization is identifying equivalent formulations, which can lead to more efficient solution strategies and deeper insights into a problem's computational complexity. The need to automatically identify equivalence between problem formulations has grown as optimization copilots--systems that generate problem formulations from natural language descriptions--have proliferated. However, existing approaches to checking formulation equivalence lack grounding, relying on simple heuristics which are insufficient for rigorous validation. Inspired by Karp reductions, in this work we introduce quasi-Karp equivalence, a formal criterion for determining when two optimization formulations are equivalent based on the existence of a mapping between their decision variables. We propose EquivaMap, a framework that leverages large language models to automatically discover such mappings, enabling scalable and reliable equivalence verification. To evaluate our approach, we construct the first open-source dataset of equivalent optimization formulations, generated by applying transformations such as adding slack variables or valid inequalities to existing formulations. Empirically, EquivaMap significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial improvements in correctly identifying formulation equivalence.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multivariate Robust Mean Estimation Under Mean-Shift Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of robust mean estimation of an identity covariance Gaussian in the presence of mean-shift contamination. In this contamination model, we are given a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generated i.i.d. via the following process. For a parameter $\alpha&lt;1/2$, the $i$-th sample $x_i$ is obtained as follows: with probability $1-\alpha$, $x_i$ is drawn from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, I)$, where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the target mean; and with probability $\alpha$, $x_i$ is drawn from $\mathcal{N}(z_i, I)$, where $z_i$ is unknown and potentially arbitrary. Prior work characterized the information-theoretic limits of this task. Specifically, it was shown that, in contrast to Huber contamination, in the presence of mean-shift contamination consistent estimation is possible. On the other hand, all known robust estimators in the mean-shift model have running times exponential in the dimension. Here we give the first computationally efficient algorithm for high-dimensional robust mean estimation with mean-shift contamination that can tolerate a constant fraction of outliers. In particular, our algorithm has near-optimal sample complexity, runs in sample-polynomial time, and approximates the target mean to any desired accuracy. Conceptually, our result contributes to a growing body of work that studies inference with respect to natural noise models lying in between fully adversarial and random settings.</description>

      <title>A Neural Operator-Based Emulator for Regional Shallow Water Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Accurate real-time forecasting of hydrodynamic processes in these areas is essential for infrastructure planning and climate adaptation. In this study, we present the Multiple-Input Temporal Operator Network (MITONet), a novel autoregressive neural emulator that employs dimensionality reduction to efficiently approximate high-dimensional numerical solvers for complex, nonlinear problems that are governed by time-dependent, parameterized partial differential equations. Although MITONet is applicable to a wide range of problems, we showcase its capabilities by forecasting regional tide-driven dynamics described by the two-dimensional shallow-water equations, while incorporating initial conditions, boundary conditions, and a varying domain parameter. We demonstrate MITONet's performance in a real-world application, highlighting its ability to make accurate predictions by extrapolating both in time and parametric space.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Device Reach Forecasting Using HLL and MinHash Data Sketches</title>

Abstract: Predicting the right number of TVs (Device Reach) in real-time based on a user-specified targeting attributes is imperative for running multi-million dollar ADs business. The traditional approach of SQL queries to join billions of records across multiple targeting dimensions is extremely slow. As a workaround, many applications will have an offline process to crunch these numbers and present the results after many hours. In our case, the solution was an offline process taking 24 hours to onboard a customer resulting in a potential loss of business. To solve this problem, we have built a new real-time prediction system using MinHash and HyperLogLog (HLL) data sketches to compute the device reach at runtime when a user makes a request. However, existing MinHash implementations do not solve the complex problem of multilevel aggregation and intersection. This work will show how we have solved this problem, in addition, we have improved MinHash algorithm to run 4 times faster using Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) vectorized operations for high speed and accuracy with constant space to process billions of records. Finally, by experiments, we prove that the results are as accurate as traditional offline prediction system with an acceptable error rate of 5%.</description>

      <title>Rapid Word Learning Through Meta In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans can quickly learn a new word from a few illustrative examples, and then systematically and flexibly use it in novel contexts. Yet the abilities of current language models for few-shot word learning, and methods for improving these abilities, are underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel method, Meta-training for IN-context learNing Of Words (Minnow). This method trains language models to generate new examples of a word's usage given a few in-context examples, using a special placeholder token to represent the new word. This training is repeated on many new words to develop a general word-learning ability. We find that training models from scratch with Minnow on human-scale child-directed language enables strong few-shot word learning, comparable to a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on orders of magnitude more data. Furthermore, through discriminative and generative evaluations, we demonstrate that finetuning pre-trained LLMs with Minnow improves their ability to discriminate between new words, identify syntactic categories of new words, and generate reasonable new usages and definitions for new words, based on one or a few in-context examples. These findings highlight the data efficiency of Minnow and its potential to improve language model performance in word learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Model Selection for Compound AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compound AI systems that combine multiple LLM calls, such as self-refine and multi-agent-debate, achieve strong performance on many AI tasks. We address a core question in optimizing compound systems: for each LLM call or module in the system, how should one decide which LLM to use? We show that these LLM choices have a large effect on quality, but the search space is exponential. We propose LLMSelector, an efficient framework for model selection in compound systems, which leverages two key empirical insights: (i) end-to-end performance is often monotonic in how well each module performs, with all other modules held fixed, and (ii) per-module performance can be estimated accurately by an LLM. Building upon these insights, LLMSelector iteratively selects one module and allocates to it the model with the highest module-wise performance, as estimated by an LLM, until no further gain is possible. LLMSelector is applicable to any compound system with a bounded number of modules, and its number of API calls scales linearly with the number of modules, achieving high-quality model allocation both empirically and theoretically. Experiments with popular compound systems such as multi-agent debate and self-refine using LLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 show that LLMSelector confers 5%-70% accuracy gains compared to using the same LLM for all modules.</description>

      <title>Meshless Shape Optimization using Neural Networks and Partial Differential Equations on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shape optimization involves the minimization of a cost function defined over a set of shapes, often governed by a partial differential equation (PDE). In the absence of closed-form solutions, one relies on numerical methods to approximate the solution. The level set method -- when coupled with the finite element method -- is one of the most versatile numerical shape optimization approaches but still suffers from the limitations of most mesh-based methods. In this work, we present a fully meshless level set framework that leverages neural networks to parameterize the level set function and employs the graph Laplacian to approximate the underlying PDE. Our approach enables precise computations of geometric quantities such as surface normals and curvature, and allows tackling optimization problems within the class of convex shapes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Advanced Techniques for Visual Question Answering: A Comprehensive Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has emerged as a pivotal task in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, requiring models to understand and reason about visual content in response to natural language questions. Analyzing VQA datasets is essential for developing robust models that can handle the complexities of multimodal reasoning. Several approaches have been developed to examine these datasets, each offering distinct perspectives on question diversity, answer distribution, and visual-textual correlations. Despite significant progress, existing VQA models face challenges related to dataset bias, limited model complexity, commonsense reasoning gaps, rigid evaluation methods, and generalization to real world scenarios. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of five advanced VQA models: ABC-CNN, KICNLE, Masked Vision and Language Modeling, BLIP-2, and OFA, each employing distinct methodologies to address these challenges.</description>

      <title>Improving the Diffusability of Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for generating high-quality images and videos, utilizing compressed latent representations to reduce the computational burden of the diffusion process. While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K 256x256 and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 17x256x256.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Concepts Personalization from Single Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalizing generative text-to-image models has seen remarkable progress, but extending this personalization to text-to-video models presents unique challenges. Unlike static concepts, personalizing text-to-video models has the potential to capture dynamic concepts, i.e., entities defined not only by their appearance but also by their motion. In this paper, we introduce Set-and-Sequence, a novel framework for personalizing Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)-based generative video models with dynamic concepts. Our approach imposes a spatio-temporal weight space within an architecture that does not explicitly separate spatial and temporal features. This is achieved in two key stages. First, we fine-tune Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers using an unordered set of frames from the video to learn an identity LoRA basis that represents the appearance, free from temporal interference. In the second stage, with the identity LoRAs frozen, we augment their coefficients with Motion Residuals and fine-tune them on the full video sequence, capturing motion dynamics. Our Set-and-Sequence framework results in a spatio-temporal weight space that effectively embeds dynamic concepts into the video model's output domain, enabling unprecedented editability and compositionality while setting a new benchmark for personalizing dynamic concepts.</description>

      <title>FR-Spec: Accelerating Large-Vocabulary Language Models via Frequency-Ranked Speculative Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative sampling has emerged as an important technique for accelerating the auto-regressive generation process of large language models (LLMs) by utilizing a draft-then-verify mechanism to produce multiple tokens per forward pass. While state-of-the-art speculative sampling methods use only a single layer and a language modeling (LM) head as the draft model to achieve impressive layer compression, their efficiency gains are substantially reduced for large-vocabulary LLMs, such as Llama-3-8B with a vocabulary of 128k tokens. To address this, we present FR-Spec, a frequency-ranked speculative sampling framework that optimizes draft candidate selection through vocabulary space compression. By constraining the draft search to a frequency-prioritized token subset, our method reduces LM Head computation overhead by 75% while ensuring the equivalence of the final output distribution. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate an average of 1.12$\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art speculative sampling method EAGLE-2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding historical and cultural artifacts demands human expertise and advanced computational techniques, yet the process remains complex and time-intensive. While large multimodal models offer promising support, their evaluation and improvement require a standardized benchmark. To address this, we introduce TimeTravel, a benchmark of 10,250 expert-verified samples spanning 266 distinct cultures across 10 major historical regions. Designed for AI-driven analysis of manuscripts, artworks, inscriptions, and archaeological discoveries, TimeTravel provides a structured dataset and robust evaluation framework to assess AI models' capabilities in classification, interpretation, and historical comprehension. By integrating AI with historical research, TimeTravel fosters AI-powered tools for historians, archaeologists, researchers, and cultural tourists to extract valuable insights while ensuring technology contributes meaningfully to historical discovery and cultural heritage preservation. We evaluate contemporary AI models on TimeTravel, highlighting their strengths and identifying areas for improvement. Our goal is to establish AI as a reliable partner in preserving cultural heritage, ensuring that technological advancements contribute meaningfully to historical discovery.

      <title>LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences, yet efficiently serving these long-context models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy.

      <title>Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Conditional Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.12833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial in training deep neural networks on new target tasks. Current transfer learning methods always assume at least one of (i) source and target task label spaces overlap, (ii) source datasets are available, and (iii) target network architectures are consistent with source ones. However, holding these assumptions is difficult in practical settings because the target task rarely has the same labels as the source task, the source dataset access is restricted due to storage costs and privacy, and the target architecture is often specialized to each task. To transfer source knowledge without these assumptions, we propose a transfer learning method that uses deep generative models and is composed of the following two stages: pseudo pre-training (PP) and pseudo semi-supervised learning (P-SSL). PP trains a target architecture with an artificial dataset synthesized by using conditional source generative models. P-SSL applies SSL algorithms to labeled target data and unlabeled pseudo samples, which are generated by cascading the source classifier and generative models to condition them with target samples. Our experimental results indicate that our method can outperform the baselines of scratch training and knowledge distillation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.07528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of contextual search, a generalization of binary search in higher dimensions, in the adversarial noise model. Let $d$ be the dimension of the problem, $T$ be the time horizon and $C$ be the total amount of adversarial noise in the system. We focus on the $\epsilon$-ball and the absolute loss. For the $\epsilon$-ball loss, we give a tight regret bound of $O(C + d \log(1/\epsilon))$ improving over the $O(d^3 \log(1/\epsilon) \log^2(T) + C \log(T) \log(1/\epsilon))$ bound of Krishnamurthy et al (Operations Research '23). For the absolute loss, we give an efficient algorithm with regret $O(C+d \log T)$. To tackle the absolute loss case, we study the more general setting of Corruption-Robust Convex Optimization with Subgradient feedback, which is of independent interest.
  Our techniques are a significant departure from prior approaches. Specifically, we keep track of density functions over the candidate target vectors instead of a knowledge set consisting of the candidate target vectors consistent with the feedback obtained.</description>

      <title>On the Effective Horizon of Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms often rely on (forward) reinforcement learning or planning, over a given time horizon, to compute an approximately optimal policy for a hypothesized reward function; they then match this policy with expert demonstrations. The time horizon plays a critical role in determining both the accuracy of reward estimates and the computational efficiency of IRL algorithms. Interestingly, an *effective time horizon* shorter than the ground-truth value often produces better results faster. This work formally analyzes this phenomenon and provides an explanation: the time horizon controls the complexity of an induced policy class and mitigates overfitting with limited data. This analysis provides a guide for the principled choice of the effective horizon for IRL. It also prompts us to re-examine the classic IRL formulation: it is more natural to learn jointly the reward and the effective horizon rather than the reward alone with a given horizon. To validate our findings, we implement a cross-validation extension and the experimental results support the theoretical analysis. The project page and code are publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, particularly those from query-based black-box attacks. Despite various efforts to detect and prevent such attacks, ML systems are still at risk, demanding a more comprehensive approach to security that includes logging, analyzing, and sharing evidence. While traditional security benefits from well-established practices of forensics and threat intelligence sharing, ML security has yet to find a way to profile its attackers and share information about them. In response, this paper introduces SEA, a novel ML security system to characterize black-box attacks on ML systems for forensic purposes and to facilitate human-explainable intelligence sharing. SEA leverages Hidden Markov Models to attribute the observed query sequence to known attacks. It thus understands the attack's progression rather than focusing solely on the final adversarial examples. Our evaluations reveal that SEA is effective at attack attribution, even on the second incident, and is robust to adaptive strategies designed to evade forensic analysis. SEA's explanations of the attack's behavior allow us even to fingerprint specific minor bugs in widely used attack libraries. For example, we discover that the SignOPT and Square attacks in ART v1.14 send over 50% duplicated queries. We thoroughly evaluate SEA on a variety of settings and demonstrate that it can recognize the same attack with more than 90% Top-1 and 95% Top-3 accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how SEA generalizes to other domains like text classification.</description>

      <title>On Memorization in Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Due to their capacity to generate novel and high-quality samples, diffusion models have attracted significant research interest in recent years. Notably, the typical training objective of diffusion models, i.e., denoising score matching, has a closed-form optimal solution that can only generate training data replicating samples. This indicates that a memorization behavior is theoretically expected, which contradicts the common generalization ability of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and thus calls for a deeper understanding. Looking into this, we first observe that memorization behaviors tend to occur on smaller-sized datasets, which motivates our definition of effective model memorization (EMM), a metric measuring the maximum size of training data at which a learned diffusion model approximates its theoretical optimum. Then, we quantify the impact of the influential factors on these memorization behaviors in terms of EMM, focusing primarily on data distribution, model configuration, and training procedure. Besides comprehensive empirical results identifying the influential factors, we surprisingly find that conditioning training data on uninformative random labels can significantly trigger the memorization in diffusion models. Our study holds practical significance for diffusion model users and offers clues to theoretical research in deep generative models.

      <title>Differentially Private Optimization for Non-Decomposable Objective Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training is a common step in developing computer vision models and large language models. In this setting, the absence of labels requires the use of similarity-based loss functions, such as contrastive loss, that favor minimizing the distance between similar inputs and maximizing the distance between distinct inputs. As privacy concerns mount, training these models using differential privacy has become more important. However, due to how inputs are generated for these losses, one of their undesirable properties is that their $L_2$ sensitivity grows with the batch size. This property is particularly disadvantageous for differentially private training methods, such as DP-SGD. To overcome this issue, we develop a new DP-SGD variant for similarity based loss functions -- in particular, the commonly-used contrastive loss -- that manipulates gradients of the objective function in a novel way to obtain a sensitivity of the summed gradient that is $O(1)$ for batch size $n$. We test our DP-SGD variant on some CIFAR-10 pre-training and CIFAR-100 finetuning tasks and show that, in both tasks, our method's performance comes close to that of a non-private model and generally outperforms DP-SGD applied directly to the contrastive loss.</description>

      <title>FREE: The Foundational Semantic Recognition for Modeling Environmental Ecosystems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling environmental ecosystems is critical for the sustainability of our planet, but is extremely challenging due to the complex underlying processes driven by interactions amongst a large number of physical variables. As many variables are difficult to measure at large scales, existing works often utilize a combination of observable features and locally available measurements or modeled values as input to build models for a specific study region and time period. This raises a fundamental question in advancing the modeling of environmental ecosystems: how to build a general framework for modeling the complex relationships amongst various environmental data over space and time? In this paper, we introduce a framework, FREE, which maps available environmental data into a text space and then converts the traditional predictive modeling task in environmental science to a semantic recognition problem. The proposed framework leverages recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to supplement the original input features with natural language descriptions. This framework facilitates capturing the data semantics and allows harnessing the irregularities of input features. When used for long-term prediction, FREE has the flexibility to incorporate newly collected observations to enhance future prediction. The efficacy of FREE is evaluated in the context of two societally important real-world applications, predicting stream water temperature in the Delaware River Basin and predicting annual corn yield in Illinois and Iowa. Beyond the superior predictive performance over multiple baselines, FREE is shown to be more data- and computation-efficient as it can be pre-trained on simulated data generated by physics-based models.</description>

Abstract: The conclusion of an AI challenge is not the end of its lifecycle; ensuring a long-lasting impact requires meticulous post-challenge activities. The long-lasting impact also needs to be organised. This chapter covers the various activities after the challenge is formally finished. This work identifies target audiences for post-challenge initiatives and outlines methods for collecting and organizing challenge outputs. The multiple outputs of the challenge are listed, along with the means to collect them. The central part of the chapter is a template for a typical post-challenge paper, including possible graphs and advice on how to turn the challenge into a long-lasting benchmark.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current deep learning models are not designed to simultaneously address three fundamental questions: predict class labels to solve a given classification task (the "What?"), simulate changes in the situation to evaluate how this impacts class predictions (the "How?"), and imagine how the scenario should change to result in different class predictions (the "Why not?"). The inability to answer these questions represents a crucial gap in deploying reliable AI agents, calibrating human trust, and improving human-machine interaction. To bridge this gap, we introduce CounterFactual Concept Bottleneck Models (CF-CBMs), a class of models designed to efficiently address the above queries all at once without the need to run post-hoc searches. Our experimental results demonstrate that CF-CBMs: achieve classification accuracy comparable to black-box models and existing CBMs ("What?"), rely on fewer important concepts leading to simpler explanations ("How?"), and produce interpretable, concept-based counterfactuals ("Why not?"). Additionally, we show that training the counterfactual generator jointly with the CBM leads to two key improvements: (i) it alters the model's decision-making process, making the model rely on fewer important concepts (leading to simpler explanations), and (ii) it significantly increases the causal effect of concept interventions on class predictions, making the model more responsive to these changes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Gradient Influencing for Viral Marketing Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of maximizing the adoption of a product through viral marketing in social networks has been studied heavily through postulated network models. We present a novel data-driven formulation of the problem. We use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the adoption of products by utilizing both topological and attribute information. The resulting Dynamic Viral Marketing (DVM) problem seeks to find the minimum budget and minimal set of dynamic topological and attribute changes in order to attain a specified adoption goal. We show that DVM is NP-Hard and is related to the existing influence maximization problem. Motivated by this connection, we develop the idea of Dynamic Gradient Influencing (DGI) that uses gradient ranking to find optimal perturbations and targets low-budget and high influence non-adopters in discrete steps. We use an efficient strategy for computing node budgets and develop the ''Meta-Influence'' heuristic for assessing a node's downstream influence. We evaluate DGI against multiple baselines and demonstrate gains on average of 24% on budget and 37% on AUC on real-world attributed networks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/saurabhsharma1993/dynamic_viral_marketing.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Why Label Smoothing Degrades Selective Classification and How to Fix It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Label smoothing (LS) is a popular regularisation method for training neural networks as it is effective in improving test accuracy and is simple to implement. ``Hard'' one-hot labels are ``smoothed'' by uniformly distributing probability mass to other classes, reducing overfitting. Prior work has suggested that in some cases LS can degrade selective classification (SC) -- where the aim is to reject misclassifications using a model's uncertainty. In this work, we first demonstrate empirically across an extended range of large-scale tasks and architectures that LS consistently degrades SC. We then address a gap in existing knowledge, providing an explanation for this behaviour by analysing logit-level gradients: LS degrades the uncertainty rank ordering of correct vs incorrect predictions by suppressing the max logit more when a prediction is likely to be correct, and less when it is likely to be wrong. This elucidates previously reported experimental results where strong classifiers underperform in SC. We then demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of post-hoc logit normalisation for recovering lost SC performance caused by LS. Furthermore, linking back to our gradient analysis, we again provide an explanation for why such normalisation is effective.</description>

      <title>Fast Bayesian Inference for Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions at Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional parameter spaces are commonly encountered in physics theories that go beyond the Standard Model. However, they often possess complicated posterior geometries that are expensive to traverse using techniques traditional to astroparticle physics. Several recent innovations, which are only beginning to make their way into this field, have made navigating such complex posteriors possible. These include GPU acceleration, automatic differentiation, and neural-network-guided reparameterization. We apply these advancements to dark matter direct detection experiments in the context of non-standard neutrino interactions and benchmark their performances against traditional nested sampling techniques when conducting Bayesian inference. Compared to nested sampling alone, we find that these techniques increase performance for both nested sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, accelerating inference by factors of $\sim 100$ and $\sim 60$, respectively. As nested sampling also evaluates the Bayesian evidence, these advancements can be exploited to improve model comparison performance while retaining compatibility with existing implementations that are widely used in the natural sciences. Using these techniques, we perform the first scan in the neutrino non-standard interactions parameter space for direct detection experiments whereby all parameters are allowed to vary simultaneously. We expect that these advancements are broadly applicable to other areas of astroparticle physics featuring multi-dimensional parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Training Deep-Learning Parametric Policies using Lagrangian Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are critical in many high-stakes applications, where decisions must optimize cumulative rewards while strictly adhering to complex nonlinear constraints. In domains such as power systems, finance, supply chains, and precision robotics, violating these constraints can result in significant financial or societal costs. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often struggle with sample efficiency and effectiveness in finding feasible policies for highly and strictly constrained CMDPs, limiting their applicability in these environments. Stochastic dual dynamic programming is often used in practice on convex relaxations of the original problem, but they also encounter computational challenges and loss of optimality. This paper introduces a novel approach, Two-Stage Deep Decision Rules (TS-DDR), to efficiently train parametric actor policies using Lagrangian Duality. TS-DDR is a self-supervised learning algorithm that trains general decision rules (parametric policies) using stochastic gradient descent (SGD); its forward passes solve {\em deterministic} optimization problems to find feasible policies, and its backward passes leverage duality theory to train the parametric policy with closed-form gradients. TS-DDR inherits the flexibility and computational performance of deep learning methodologies to solve CMDP problems. Applied to the Long-Term Hydrothermal Dispatch (LTHD) problem using actual power system data from Bolivia, TS-DDR is shown to enhance solution quality and to reduce computation times by several orders of magnitude when compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>SpinQuant: LLM quantization with learned rotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16406v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures while enhancing quantization accuracy. In addition, we find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant, a novel approach that incorporates learned rotation matrices for optimal quantized network accuracy. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. Furthermore, SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by up to 45.1% relative to QuaRot.

      <title>Neural Green's Operators for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces neural Green's operators (NGOs), a novel neural operator network architecture that learns the solution operator for a parametric family of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Our construction of NGOs is derived directly from the Green's formulation of such a solution operator. Similar to deep operator networks (DeepONets) and variationally mimetic operator networks (VarMiONs), NGOs constitutes an expansion of the solution to the PDE in terms of basis functions, that is returned from a sub-network, contracted with coefficients, that are returned from another sub-network. However, in accordance with the Green's formulation, NGOs accept weighted averages of the input functions, rather than sampled values thereof, as is the case in DeepONets and VarMiONs. Application of NGOs to canonical linear parametric PDEs shows that, while they remain competitive with DeepONets, VarMiONs and Fourier neural operators when testing on data that lie within the training distribution, they robustly generalize when testing on finer-scale data generated outside of the training distribution. Furthermore, we show that the explicit representation of the Green's function that is returned by NGOs enables the construction of effective preconditioners for numerical solvers for PDEs.</description>

Abstract: Following the success of the in-context learning paradigm in large-scale language and computer vision models, the recently emerging field of in-context reinforcement learning is experiencing a rapid growth. However, its development has been held back by the lack of challenging benchmarks, as all the experiments have been carried out in simple environments and on small-scale datasets. We present XLand-100B, a large-scale dataset for in-context reinforcement learning based on the XLand-MiniGrid environment, as a first step to alleviate this problem. It contains complete learning histories for nearly $30,000$ different tasks, covering $100$B transitions and 2.5B episodes. It took 50,000 GPU hours to collect the dataset, which is beyond the reach of most academic labs. Along with the dataset, we provide the utilities to reproduce or expand it even further. We also benchmark common in-context RL baselines and show that they struggle to generalize to novel and diverse tasks. With this substantial effort, we aim to democratize research in the rapidly growing field of in-context reinforcement learning and provide a solid foundation for further scaling.</description>

      <title>Convex space learning for tabular synthetic data generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating synthetic samples from the convex space of the minority class is a popular oversampling approach for imbalanced classification problems. Recently, deep-learning approaches have been successfully applied to modeling the convex space of minority samples. Beyond oversampling, learning the convex space of neighborhoods in training data has not been used to generate entire tabular datasets. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning architecture (NextConvGeN) with a generator and discriminator component that can generate synthetic samples by learning to model the convex space of tabular data. The generator takes data neighborhoods as input and creates synthetic samples within the convex space of that neighborhood. Thereafter, the discriminator tries to classify these synthetic samples against a randomly sampled batch of data from the rest of the data space. We compared our proposed model with five state-of-the-art tabular generative models across ten publicly available datasets from the biomedical domain. Our analysis reveals that synthetic samples generated by NextConvGeN can better preserve classification and clustering performance across real and synthetic data than other synthetic data generation models. Synthetic data generation by deep learning of the convex space produces high scores for popular utility measures. We further compared how diverse synthetic data generation strategies perform in the privacy-utility spectrum and produced critical arguments on the necessity of high utility models. Our research on deep learning of the convex space of tabular data opens up opportunities in clinical research, machine learning model development, decision support systems, and clinical data sharing.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning</title>

Abstract: Learning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influences the model's predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language models during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question A, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a unique "squeezing effect" to explain a previously observed phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides insights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analysis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM's finetuning but also inspires a simple, effective method to improve alignment performance.</description>

      <title>Scaling Trends in Language Model Robustness</title>

Abstract: Language models exhibit scaling laws, whereby increasing model and dataset size predictably decrease negative log likelihood, unlocking a dazzling array of capabilities. At the same time, even the most capable systems are currently vulnerable to adversarial inputs such as jailbreaks and prompt injections, despite concerted efforts to make them robust. As compute becomes more accessible to both attackers and defenders, which side will benefit more from scale? We attempt to answer this question with a detailed study of robustness on language models spanning three orders of magnitude in parameter count. From the defender's perspective, we find that in the absence of other interventions, increasing model size alone does not consistently improve robustness. In adversarial training, we find that larger models are more sample-efficient and less compute-efficient than smaller models, and often better generalize their defense to new threat models. From the attacker's perspective, we find that increasing attack compute smoothly and reliably increases attack success rate against both finetuned and adversarially trained models. Finally, we show that across model sizes studied, doubling compute on adversarial training only forces an attacker to less than double attack compute to maintain the same attack success rate. However, adversarial training becomes more and more effective on larger models, suggesting that defenders could eventually have the advantage with increasing model size. These results underscore the value of adopting a scaling lens when discussing robustness of frontier models.</description>

      <title>A domain decomposition-based autoregressive deep learning model for unsteady and nonlinear partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a domain-decomposition-based deep learning (DL) framework, named transient-CoMLSim, for accurately modeling unsteady and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The framework consists of two key components: (a) a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoencoder architecture and (b) an autoregressive model composed of fully connected layers. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods that operate on the entire computational domain, our CNN-based autoencoder computes a lower-dimensional basis for solution and condition fields represented on subdomains. Timestepping is performed entirely in the latent space, generating embeddings of the solution variables from the time history of embeddings of solution and condition variables. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also enhances scalability, making it well-suited for large-scale simulations. Furthermore, to improve the stability of our rollouts, we employ a curriculum learning (CL) approach during the training of the autoregressive model. The domain-decomposition strategy enables scaling to out-of-distribution domain sizes while maintaining the accuracy of predictions -- a feature not easily integrated into popular DL-based approaches for physics simulations. We benchmark our model against two widely-used DL architectures, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and U-Net, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms them in terms of accuracy, extrapolation to unseen timesteps, and stability for a wide range of use cases.</description>

      <title>On the effects of similarity metrics in decentralized deep learning under distributional shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Learning (DL) enables privacy-preserving collaboration among organizations or users to enhance the performance of local deep learning models. However, model aggregation becomes challenging when client data is heterogeneous, and identifying compatible collaborators without direct data exchange remains a pressing issue. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of various similarity metrics in DL for identifying peers for model merging, conducting an empirical analysis across multiple datasets with distribution shifts. Our research provides insights into the performance of these metrics, examining their role in facilitating effective collaboration. By exploring the strengths and limitations of these metrics, we contribute to the development of robust DL methods.</description>

      <title>An efficient wavelet-based physics-informed neural networks for singularly perturbed problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models that utilize physics in the form of differential equations to address complex problems, including ones that may involve limited data availability. However, tackling solutions of differential equations with rapid oscillations, steep gradients, or singular behavior becomes challenging for PINNs. Considering these challenges, we designed an efficient wavelet-based PINNs (W-PINNs) model to address this class of differential equations. Here, we represent the solution in wavelet space using a family of smooth-compactly supported wavelets. This framework represents the solution of a differential equation with significantly fewer degrees of freedom while still retaining the dynamics of complex physical phenomena. The architecture allows the training process to search for a solution within the wavelet space, making the process faster and more accurate. Further, the proposed model does not rely on automatic differentiations for derivatives involved in differential equations and does not require any prior information regarding the behavior of the solution, such as the location of abrupt features. Thus, through a strategic fusion of wavelets with PINNs, W-PINNs excel at capturing localized nonlinear information, making them well-suited for problems showing abrupt behavior in certain regions, such as singularly perturbed and multiscale problems. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed neural network model are demonstrated in various 1D and 2D test problems, i.e., the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, the Helmholtz equation, the Maxwell's equation, lid-driven cavity flow, and the Allen-Cahn equation, along with other highly singularly perturbed nonlinear differential equations. The proposed model significantly improves with traditional PINNs, recently developed wavelet-based PINNs, and other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Second Order Bounds for Contextual Bandits with Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many works have developed no-regret algorithms for contextual bandits with function approximation, where the mean reward function over context-action pairs belongs to a function class. Although there are many approaches to this problem, one that has gained in importance is the use of algorithms based on the optimism principle such as optimistic least squares. It can be shown the regret of this algorithm scales as square root of the product of the eluder dimension (a statistical measure of the complexity of the function class), the logarithm of the function class size and the time horizon. Unfortunately, even if the variance of the measurement noise of the rewards at each time is changing and is very small, the regret of the optimistic least squares algorithm scales with square root of the time horizon. In this work we are the first to develop algorithms that satisfy regret bounds of scaling not with the square root of the time horizon, but the square root of the sum of the measurement variances in the setting of contextual bandits with function approximation when the variances are unknown. These bounds generalize existing techniques for deriving second order bounds in contextual linear problems.</description>

      <title>Strongly-polynomial time and validation analysis of policy gradient methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19437v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel termination criterion, termed the advantage gap function, for finite state and action Markov decision processes (MDP) and reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating this advantage gap function into the design of step size rules and deriving a new linear rate of convergence that is independent of the stationary state distribution of the optimal policy, we demonstrate that policy gradient methods can solve MDPs in strongly-polynomial time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such strong convergence properties have been established for policy gradient methods. Moreover, in the stochastic setting, where only stochastic estimates of policy gradients are available, we show that the advantage gap function provides close approximations of the optimality gap for each individual state and exhibits a sublinear rate of convergence at every state. The advantage gap function can be easily estimated in the stochastic case, and when coupled with easily computable upper bounds on policy values, they provide a convenient way to validate the solutions generated by policy gradient methods. Therefore, our developments offer a principled and computable measure of optimality for RL, whereas current practice tends to rely on algorithm-to-algorithm or baselines comparisons with no certificate of optimality.</description>

      <title>Looped ReLU MLPs May Be All You Need as Practical Programmable Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that attention mechanisms are Turing complete. More recently, it has been shown that a looped 9-layer Transformer can function as a universal programmable computer. In contrast, the multi-layer perceptrons with $\mathsf{ReLU}$ activation ($\mathsf{ReLU}$-$\mathsf{MLP}$), one of the most fundamental components of neural networks, is known to be expressive; specifically, a two-layer neural network is a universal approximator given an exponentially large number of hidden neurons. However, it remains unclear whether a $\mathsf{ReLU}$-$\mathsf{MLP}$ can be made into a universal programmable computer using a practical number of weights. In this work, we provide an affirmative answer that a looped 23-layer $\mathsf{ReLU}$-$\mathsf{MLP}$ is capable of performing the basic necessary operations, more efficiently and effectively functioning as a programmable computer than a looped Transformer. This indicates simple modules have stronger expressive power than previously expected and have not been fully explored. Our work provides insights into the mechanisms of neural networks and demonstrates that complex tasks, such as functioning as a programmable computer, do not necessarily require advanced architectures like Transformers.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization Efficiently Selects Flatter Minima Late in Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has substantially improved the generalization of neural networks under various settings. Despite the success, its effectiveness remains poorly understood. In this work, we discover an intriguing phenomenon in the training dynamics of SAM, shedding light on understanding its implicit bias towards flatter minima over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Specifically, we find that SAM efficiently selects flatter minima late in training. Remarkably, even a few epochs of SAM applied at the end of training yield nearly the same generalization and solution sharpness as full SAM training. Subsequently, we delve deeper into the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon. Theoretically, we identify two phases in the learning dynamics after applying SAM late in training: i) SAM first escapes the minimum found by SGD exponentially fast; and ii) then rapidly converges to a flatter minimum within the same valley. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the role of SAM during the early training phase. We conjecture that the optimization method chosen in the late phase is more crucial in shaping the final solution's properties. Based on this viewpoint, we extend our findings from SAM to Adversarial Training.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Content Selection and the Impact of User Disengagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital services face a fundamental trade-off in content selection: they must balance the immediate revenue gained from high-reward content against the long-term benefits of maintaining user engagement. Traditional multi-armed bandit models assume that users remain perpetually engaged, failing to capture the possibility that users may disengage when dissatisfied, thereby reducing future revenue potential.
  In this work, we introduce a model for the content selection problem that explicitly accounts for variable user engagement and disengagement. In our framework, content that maximizes immediate reward is not necessarily optimal in terms of fostering sustained user engagement.
  Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop computational and statistical methods for offline optimization and online learning of content selection policies. For users whose engagement patterns are defined by $k$ distinct levels, we design a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the exact optimal policy in $O(k^2)$ time. Moreover, we derive no-regret learning guarantees for an online learning setting in which the platform serves a series of users with unknown and potentially adversarial engagement patterns.
  Second, we introduce the concept of modified demand elasticity which captures how small changes in a user's overall satisfaction affect the platform's ability to secure long-term revenue. This notion generalizes classical demand elasticity by incorporating the dynamics of user re-engagement, thereby revealing key insights into the interplay between engagement and revenue. Notably, our analysis uncovers a counterintuitive phenomenon: although higher friction (i.e., a reduced likelihood of re-engagement) typically lowers overall revenue, it can simultaneously lead to higher user engagement under optimal content selection policies.</description>

      <title>On Diffusion Models for Multi-Agent Partial Observability: Shared Attractors, Error Bounds, and Composite Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiagent systems grapple with partial observability (PO), and the decentralized POMDP (Dec-POMDP) model highlights the fundamental nature of this challenge. Whereas recent approaches to addressing PO have appealed to deep learning models, providing a rigorous understanding of how these models and their approximation errors affect agents' handling of PO and their interactions remain a challenge. In addressing this challenge, we investigate reconstructing global states from local action-observation histories in Dec-POMDPs using diffusion models. We first find that diffusion models conditioned on local history represent possible states as stable fixed points. In collectively observable (CO) Dec-POMDPs, individual diffusion models conditioned on agents' local histories share a unique fixed point corresponding to the global state, while in non-CO settings, shared fixed points yield a distribution of possible states given joint history. We further find that, with deep learning approximation errors, fixed points can deviate from true states and the deviation is negatively correlated to the Jacobian rank. Inspired by this low-rank property, we bound a deviation by constructing a surrogate linear regression model that approximates the local behavior of a diffusion model. With this bound, we propose a \emph{composite diffusion process} iterating over agents with theoretical convergence guarantees to the true state.</description>

      <title>How Does Critical Batch Size Scale in Pre-training?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training large-scale models under given resources requires careful design of parallelism strategies. In particular, the efficiency notion of critical batch size (CBS), concerning the compromise between time and compute, marks the threshold beyond which greater data parallelism leads to diminishing returns. To operationalize it, we propose a measure of CBS and pre-train a series of auto-regressive language models, ranging from 85 million to 1.2 billion parameters, on the C4 dataset. Through extensive hyper-parameter sweeps and careful control of factors such as batch size, momentum, and learning rate along with its scheduling, we systematically investigate the impact of scale on CBS. Then we fit scaling laws with respect to model and data sizes to decouple their effects. Overall, our results demonstrate that CBS scales primarily with data size rather than model size, a finding we justify theoretically through the analysis of infinite-width limits of neural networks and infinite-dimensional least squares regression. Of independent interest, we highlight the importance of common hyper-parameter choices and strategies for studying large-scale pre-training beyond fixed training durations.</description>

      <title>A Large Recurrent Action Model: xLSTM enables Fast Inference for Robotics Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a trend in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) towards large action models trained offline on large-scale datasets via sequence modeling. Existing models are primarily based on the Transformer architecture, which result in powerful agents. However, due to slow inference times, Transformer-based approaches are impractical for real-time applications, such as robotics. Recently, modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have been proposed that exhibit parallelization benefits during training similar to the Transformer architecture while offering fast inference. In this work, we study the aptitude of these modern recurrent architectures for large action models. Consequently, we propose a Large Recurrent Action Model (LRAM) with an xLSTM at its core that comes with linear-time inference complexity and natural sequence length extrapolation abilities. Experiments on 432 tasks from 6 domains show that LRAM compares favorably to Transformers in terms of performance and speed.</description>

      <title>The Belief State Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the "Belief State Transformer", a next-token predictor that takes both a prefix and suffix as inputs, with a novel objective of predicting both the next token for the prefix and the previous token for the suffix. The Belief State Transformer effectively learns to solve challenging problems that conventional forward-only transformers struggle with, in a domain-independent fashion. Key to this success is learning a compact belief state that captures all relevant information necessary for accurate predictions. Empirical ablations show that each component of the model is essential in difficult scenarios where standard Transformers fall short. For the task of story writing with known prefixes and suffixes, our approach outperforms the Fill-in-the-Middle method for reaching known goals and demonstrates improved performance even when the goals are unknown. Altogether, the Belief State Transformer enables more efficient goal-conditioned decoding, better test-time inference, and high-quality text representations on small scale problems.

Abstract: Radio propagation modeling is essential in telecommunication research, as radio channels result from complex interactions with environmental objects. Recently, Machine Learning has been attracting attention as a potential alternative to computationally demanding tools, like Ray Tracing, which can model these interactions in detail. However, existing Machine Learning approaches often attempt to learn directly specific channel characteristics, such as the coverage map, making them highly specific to the frequency and material properties and unable to fully capture the underlying propagation mechanisms. Hence, Ray Tracing, particularly the Point-to-Point variant, remains popular to accurately identify all possible paths between transmitter and receiver nodes. Still, path identification is computationally intensive because the number of paths to be tested grows exponentially while only a small fraction is valid. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-aided Ray Tracing approach to efficiently sample potential ray paths, significantly reducing the computational load while maintaining high accuracy. Our model dynamically learns to prioritize potentially valid paths among all possible paths and scales linearly with scene complexity. Unlike recent alternatives, our approach is invariant with translation, scaling, or rotation of the geometry, and avoids dependency on specific environment characteristics.</description>

      <title>Exploring How Generative MLLMs Perceive More Than CLIP with the Same Vision Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that CLIP models struggle with visual reasoning tasks that require grounding compositionality, understanding spatial relationships, or capturing fine-grained details. One natural hypothesis is that the CLIP vision encoder does not embed essential information for these tasks. However, we find that this is not always the case: The encoder gathers query-relevant visual information, while CLIP fails to extract it. In particular, we show that another branch of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieve significantly higher accuracy than CLIP in many of these tasks using the same vision encoder and weights, indicating that these Generative MLLMs perceive more -- as they extract and utilize visual information more effectively. We conduct a series of controlled experiments and reveal that their success is attributed to multiple key design choices, including patch tokens, position embeddings, and prompt-based weighting. On the other hand, enhancing the training data alone or applying a stronger text encoder does not suffice to solve the task, and additional text tokens offer little benefit. Interestingly, we find that fine-grained visual reasoning is not exclusive to generative models trained by an autoregressive loss: When converted into CLIP-like encoders by contrastive finetuning, these MLLMs still outperform CLIP under the same cosine similarity-based evaluation protocol. Our study highlights the importance of VLM architectural choices and suggests directions for improving the performance of CLIP-like contrastive VLMs.</description>

      <title>Mapping out the Space of Human Feedback for Reinforcement Learning: A Conceptual Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human feedback (RLHF) has become a powerful tool to fine-tune or train agentic machine learning models. Similar to how humans interact in social contexts, we can use many types of feedback to communicate our preferences, intentions, and knowledge to an RL agent. However, applications of human feedback in RL are often limited in scope and disregard human factors. In this work, we bridge the gap between machine learning and human-computer interaction efforts by developing a shared understanding of human feedback in interactive learning scenarios. We first introduce a taxonomy of feedback types for reward-based learning from human feedback based on nine key dimensions. Our taxonomy allows for unifying human-centered, interface-centered, and model-centered aspects. In addition, we identify seven quality metrics of human feedback influencing both the human ability to express feedback and the agent's ability to learn from the feedback. Based on the feedback taxonomy and quality criteria, we derive requirements and design choices for systems learning from human feedback. We relate these requirements and design choices to existing work in interactive machine learning. In the process, we identify gaps in existing work and future research opportunities. We call for interdisciplinary collaboration to harness the full potential of reinforcement learning with data-driven co-adaptive modeling and varied interaction mechanics.</description>

      <title>Towards counterfactual fairness through auxiliary variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge of balancing fairness and predictive accuracy in machine learning models, especially when sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age are considered, has motivated substantial research in recent years. Counterfactual fairness ensures that predictions remain consistent across counterfactual variations of sensitive attributes, which is a crucial concept in addressing societal biases. However, existing counterfactual fairness approaches usually overlook intrinsic information about sensitive features, limiting their ability to achieve fairness while simultaneously maintaining performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce EXOgenous Causal reasoning (EXOC), a novel causal reasoning framework motivated by exogenous variables. It leverages auxiliary variables to uncover intrinsic properties that give rise to sensitive attributes. Our framework explicitly defines an auxiliary node and a control node that contribute to counterfactual fairness and control the information flow within the model. Our evaluation, conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, validates EXOC's superiority, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in achieving counterfactual fairness. Our code is available at https://github.com/CASE-Lab-UMD/counterfactual_fairness_2025.</description>

Abstract: User targeting, the process of selecting targeted users from a pool of candidates for non-expert marketers, has garnered substantial attention with the advancements in digital marketing. However, existing user targeting methods encounter two significant challenges: (i) Poor cross-domain and cross-scenario transferability and generalization, and (ii) Insufficient forecastability in real-world applications. These limitations hinder their applicability across diverse industrial scenarios. In this work, we propose FOUND, an industrial-grade, transferable, and forecastable user targeting foundation model. To enhance cross-domain transferability, our framework integrates heterogeneous multi-scenario user data, aligning them with one-sentence targeting demand inputs through contrastive pre-training. For improved forecastability, the text description of each user is derived based on anticipated future behaviors, while user representations are constructed from historical information. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in cross-domain, real-world user targeting scenarios, showcasing the superior capabilities of FOUND. Moreover, our method has been successfully deployed on the Alipay platform and is widely utilized across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Graph Autoencoder for Treatment Effect Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treatment effect estimation from observational data has attracted significant attention across various research fields. However, many widely used methods rely on the unconfoundedness assumption, which is often unrealistic due to the inability to observe all confounders, thereby overlooking the influence of latent confounders. To address this limitation, recent approaches have utilized auxiliary network information to infer latent confounders, relaxing this assumption. However, these methods often treat observed variables and networks as proxies only for latent confounders, which can result in inaccuracies when certain variables influence treatment without affecting outcomes, or vice versa. This conflation of distinct latent factors undermines the precision of treatment effect estimation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel disentangled variational graph autoencoder for treatment effect estimation on networked observational data. Our graph encoder disentangles latent factors into instrumental, confounding, adjustment, and noisy factors, while enforcing factor independence using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Extensive experiments on multiple networked datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>GQSA: Group Quantization and Sparsity for Accelerating Large Language Model Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model compression has emerged as a mainstream solution to reduce memory usage and computational overhead. This paper presents Group Quantization and Sparse Acceleration (GQSA), a novel compression technique tailored for LLMs. Traditional methods typically focus exclusively on either quantization or sparsification, but relying on a single strategy often results in significant performance loss at high compression rates. In contrast, GQSA integrates quantization and sparsification in a tightly coupled manner, leveraging GPU-friendly structured group sparsity and quantization for efficient acceleration. Building upon system-algorithm co-design principles, we propose a two-stage sparse optimization strategy that ensures the performance superiority of the compressed model. On the engine side, we introduce a "task-centric" parallel strategy, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first application in the domain of sparse computing. Compared to the traditional 2:4 sparse method, the GQSA offers a more flexible and adjustable sparsity rate, as well as a higher weight compression rate, and is efficiently compatible with weight-only quantization methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, under the GQSA W4S50% compression setting, the model's accuracy surpasses that of both 2:4 pruning and W2 quantization. Furthermore, at the inference level, GQSA outperforms W2 by 1.26$\times$ and 2:4 pruning by 2.35$\times$ in terms of speed.</description>

      <title>Are DeepSeek R1 And Other Reasoning Models More Faithful?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models trained to solve reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning have achieved striking results. We refer to these models as reasoning models. A key question emerges: Are the Chains of Thought (CoTs) of reasoning models more faithful than traditional models? To investigate this, we evaluate three reasoning models (based on Qwen-2.5, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek-V3-Base) on an existing test of faithful CoT. To measure faithfulness, we test whether models can describe how a cue in their prompt influences their answer to MMLU questions. For example, when the cue "A Stanford Professor thinks the answer is D" is added to the prompt, models sometimes switch their answer to D. In such cases, the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model describes the influence of this cue 59% of the time, compared to 7% for the non-reasoning DeepSeek model. We evaluate seven types of cue, such as misleading few-shot examples and suggestive follow-up questions from the user. Reasoning models describe cues that influence them much more reliably than all the non-reasoning models tested (including Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4). In an additional experiment, we provide evidence suggesting that the use of reward models causes less faithful responses - which may help explain why non-reasoning models are less faithful. Our study has two main limitations. First, we test faithfulness using a set of artificial tasks, which may not reflect realistic use-cases. Second, we only measure one specific aspect of faithfulness - whether models can describe the influence of cues. Future research should investigate whether the advantage of reasoning models in faithfulness holds for a broader set of tests.</description>

      <title>KAA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention for Enhancing Attentive Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms, often referred to as attentive GNNs, have emerged as a prominent paradigm in advanced GNN models in recent years. However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</description>

      <title>Certified Robustness Under Bounded Levenshtein Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text classifiers suffer from small perturbations, that if chosen adversarially, can dramatically change the output of the model. Verification methods can provide robustness certificates against such adversarial perturbations, by computing a sound lower bound on the robust accuracy. Nevertheless, existing verification methods incur in prohibitive costs and cannot practically handle Levenshtein distance constraints. We propose the first method for computing the Lipschitz constant of convolutional classifiers with respect to the Levenshtein distance. We use these Lipschitz constant estimates for training 1-Lipschitz classifiers. This enables computing the certified radius of a classifier in a single forward pass. Our method, LipsLev, is able to obtain $38.80$% and $13.93$% verified accuracy at distance $1$ and $2$ respectively in the AG-News dataset, while being $4$ orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches. We believe our work can open the door to more efficient verification in the text domain.</description>

      <title>Amplifier: Bringing Attention to Neglected Low-Energy Components in Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an energy amplification technique to address the issue that existing models easily overlook low-energy components in time series forecasting. This technique comprises an energy amplification block and an energy restoration block. The energy amplification block enhances the energy of low-energy components to improve the model's learning efficiency for these components, while the energy restoration block returns the energy to its original level. Moreover, considering that the energy-amplified data typically displays two distinct energy peaks in the frequency spectrum, we integrate the energy amplification technique with a seasonal-trend forecaster to model the temporal relationships of these two peaks independently, serving as the backbone for our proposed model, Amplifier. Additionally, we propose a semi-channel interaction temporal relationship enhancement block for Amplifier, which enhances the model's ability to capture temporal relationships from the perspective of the commonality and specificity of each channel in the data. Extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks consistently demonstrate our model's superiority in both effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>STGCN-LSTM for Olympic Medal Prediction: Dynamic Power Modeling and Causal Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel hybrid model, STGCN-LSTM, to forecast Olympic medal distributions by integrating the spatio-temporal relationships among countries and the long-term dependencies of national performance. The Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) captures geographic and interactive factors-such as coaching exchange and socio-economic links-while the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module models historical trends in medal counts, economic data, and demographics. To address zero-inflated outputs (i.e., the disparity between countries that consistently yield wins and those never having won medals), a Zero-Inflated Compound Poisson (ZICP) framework is incorporated to separate random zeros from structural zeros, providing a clearer view of potential breakthrough performances. Validation includes historical backtracking, policy shock simulations, and causal inference checks, confirming the robustness of the proposed method. Results shed light on the influence of coaching mobility, event specialization, and strategic investment on medal forecasts, offering a data-driven foundation for optimizing sports policies and resource allocation in diverse Olympic contexts.</description>

      <title>TabFSBench: Tabular Benchmark for Feature Shifts in Open Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular data is widely utilized in various machine learning tasks. Current tabular learning research predominantly focuses on closed environments, while in real-world applications, open environments are often encountered, where distribution and feature shifts occur, leading to significant degradation in model performance. Previous research has primarily concentrated on mitigating distribution shifts, whereas feature shifts, a distinctive and unexplored challenge of tabular data, have garnered limited attention. To this end, this paper conducts the first comprehensive study on feature shifts in tabular data and introduces the first tabular feature-shift benchmark (TabFSBench). TabFSBench evaluates impacts of four distinct feature-shift scenarios on four tabular model categories across various datasets and assesses the performance of large language models (LLMs) and tabular LLMs in the tabular benchmark for the first time. Our study demonstrates three main observations: (1) most tabular models have the limited applicability in feature-shift scenarios; (2) the shifted feature set importance has a linear relationship with model performance degradation; (3) model performance in closed environments correlates with feature-shift performance. Future research direction is also explored for each observation. TabFSBench is released for public access by using a few lines of Python codes at https://github.com/LAMDASZ-ML/TabFSBench.</description>

      <title>Cache Me If You Must: Adaptive Key-Value Quantization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key &amp; Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.</description>

Abstract: Existing preference optimization objectives for language model alignment require additional hyperparameters that must be extensively tuned to achieve optimal performance, increasing both the complexity and time required for fine-tuning large language models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective hyperparameter-free preference optimization algorithm for alignment. We observe that promising performance can be achieved simply by optimizing inverse perplexity, which is calculated as the inverse of the exponentiated average log-likelihood of the chosen and rejected responses in the preference dataset. The resulting simple learning objective, SimPER, is easy to implement and eliminates the need for expensive hyperparameter tuning and a reference model, making it both computationally and memory efficient. Extensive experiments on widely used real-world benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2, and 10 key benchmarks of the Open LLM Leaderboard with 5 base models, demonstrate that SimPER consistently and significantly outperforms existing approaches-even without any hyperparameters or a reference model . For example, despite its simplicity, SimPER outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 5.7 points on AlpacaEval 2 and achieves the highest average ranking across 10 benchmarks on the Open LLM Leaderboard. The source code for SimPER is publicly available at: https://github.com/tengxiao1/SimPER.</description>

      <title>Sample, Scrutinize and Scale: Effective Inference-Time Search by Scaling Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling-based search, a simple paradigm for utilizing test-time compute, involves generating multiple candidate responses and selecting the best one -- typically by having models self-verify each response for correctness. In this paper, we study the scaling trends governing sampling-based search. Among our findings is that simply scaling up a minimalist implementation of sampling-based search, using only random sampling and direct self-verification, provides a practical inference method that, for example, elevates the reasoning capabilities of Gemini v1.5 Pro above that of o1-Preview on popular benchmarks. We partially attribute the scalability of sampling-based search to a phenomenon of implicit scaling, where sampling a larger pool of responses in turn improves self-verification accuracy. We further identify two useful principles for improving self-verification capabilities with test-time compute: (1) comparing across responses provides helpful signals about the locations of errors and hallucinations, and (2) different model output styles are useful for different contexts -- chains of thought are useful for reasoning but harder to verify. We also find that, though accurate verification can be elicited, frontier models demonstrate remarkably weak out-of-box verification capabilities and introduce a benchmark to measure progress on these deficiencies.</description>

      <title>ID policy (with reassignment) is asymptotically optimal for heterogeneous weakly-coupled MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge for many real-world large-scale decision-making problems but remains largely understudied. In this paper, we study the fully heterogeneous setting of a prominent class of such problems, known as weakly-coupled Markov decision processes (WCMDPs). Each WCMDP consists of $N$ arms (or subproblems), which have distinct model parameters in the fully heterogeneous setting, leading to the curse of dimensionality when $N$ is large. We show that, under mild assumptions, a natural adaptation of the ID policy, although originally proposed for a homogeneous special case of WCMDPs, in fact achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in long-run average reward per arm for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs as $N$ becomes large. This is the first asymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous average-reward WCMDPs. Our techniques highlight the construction of a novel projection-based Lyapunov function, which witnesses the convergence of rewards and costs to an optimal region in the presence of heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Aligning Human and Machine Attention for Enhanced Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attention, or prioritization of certain information items over others, is a critical element of any learning process, for both humans and machines. Given that humans continue to outperform machines in certain learning tasks, it seems plausible that machine performance could be enriched by aligning machine attention with human attention mechanisms -- yet research on this topic is sparse and has achieved only limited success. This paper proposes a new approach to address this gap, called Human-Machine Attention Learning (HuMAL). This approach involves reliance on data annotated by humans to reflect their self-perceived attention during specific tasks. We evaluate several alternative strategies for integrating such human attention data into machine learning (ML) algorithms, using a sentiment analysis task (review data from Yelp) and a personality-type classification task (data from myPersonality). The best-performing HuMAL strategy significantly enhances the task performance of fine-tuned transformer models (BERT, as well as GPT-2 and XLNET), and the benefit is particularly pronounced under challenging conditions of imbalanced or sparse labeled data. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of strategies for integrating human attention into ML models and highlights the potential of leveraging human cognition to augment ML in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Global Ease of Living Index: a machine learning framework for longitudinal analysis of major economies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The drastic changes in the global economy, geopolitical conditions, and disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the cost of living and quality of life. It is important to understand the long-term nature of the cost of living and quality of life in major economies. A transparent and comprehensive living index must include multiple dimensions of living conditions. In this study, we present an approach to quantifying the quality of life through the Global Ease of Living Index that combines various socio-economic and infrastructural factors into a single composite score. Our index utilises economic indicators that define living standards, which could help in targeted interventions to improve specific areas. We present a machine learning framework for addressing the problem of missing data for some of the economic indicators for specific countries. We then curate and update the data and use a dimensionality reduction approach (principal component analysis) to create the Ease of Living Index for major economies since 1970. Our work significantly adds to the literature by offering a practical tool for policymakers to identify areas needing improvement, such as healthcare systems, employment opportunities, and public safety. Our approach with open data and code can be easily reproduced and applied to various contexts. This transparency and accessibility make our work a valuable resource for ongoing research and policy development in quality-of-life assessment.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Optimizer Design for LLM via Structured Fisher Approximation with a Low-Rank Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing efficient optimizers for large language models (LLMs) with low-memory requirements and fast convergence is an important and challenging problem. This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice achieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers strong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory.</description>

      <title>WENDy for Nonlinear-in-Parameters ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weak-form Estimation of Non-linear Dynamics (WENDy) algorithm is extended to accommodate systems of ordinary differential equations that are nonlinear-in-parameters. The extension rests on derived analytic expressions for a likelihood function, its gradient and its Hessian matrix. WENDy makes use of these to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator based on optimization routines suited for non-convex optimization problems. The resulting parameter estimation algorithm has better accuracy, a substantially larger domain of convergence, and is often orders of magnitude faster than the conventional output error least squares method (based on forward solvers).
  The algorithm is efficiently implemented in Julia. We demonstrate the algorithm's ability to accommodate the weak form optimization for both additive normal and multiplicative log-normal noise, and present results on a suite of benchmark systems of ordinary differential equations. In order to demonstrate the practical benefits of our approach, we present extensive comparisons between our method and output error methods in terms of accuracy, precision, bias, and coverage.</description>

      <title>When do neural networks learn world models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans develop world models that capture the underlying generation process of data. Whether neural networks can learn similar world models remains an open problem. In this work, we provide the first theoretical results for this problem, showing that in a multi-task setting, models with a low-degree bias provably recover latent data-generating variables under mild assumptions -- even if proxy tasks involve complex, non-linear functions of the latents. However, such recovery is also sensitive to model architecture. Our analysis leverages Boolean models of task solutions via the Fourier-Walsh transform and introduces new techniques for analyzing invertible Boolean transforms, which may be of independent interest. We illustrate the algorithmic implications of our results and connect them to related research areas, including self-supervised learning, out-of-distribution generalization, and the linear representation hypothesis in large language models.</description>

      <title>FlexControl: Computation-Aware ControlNet with Differentiable Router for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ControlNet offers a powerful way to guide diffusion-based generative models, yet most implementations rely on ad-hoc heuristics to choose which network blocks to control-an approach that varies unpredictably with different tasks. To address this gap, we propose FlexControl, a novel framework that copies all diffusion blocks during training and employs a trainable gating mechanism to dynamically select which blocks to activate at each denoising step. With introducing a computation-aware loss, we can encourage control blocks only to activate when it benefit the generation quality. By eliminating manual block selection, FlexControl enhances adaptability across diverse tasks and streamlines the design pipeline, with computation-aware training loss in an end-to-end training manner. Through comprehensive experiments on both UNet (e.g., SD1.5) and DiT (e.g., SD3.0), we show that our method outperforms existing ControlNet variants in certain key aspects of interest. As evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, FlexControl preserves or enhances image fidelity while also reducing computational overhead by selectively activating the most relevant blocks. These results underscore the potential of a flexible, data-driven approach for controlled diffusion and open new avenues for efficient generative model design. The code will soon be available at https://github.com/Anonymousuuser/FlexControl.</description>

      <title>$\text{M}^{\text{3}}$: A Modular World Model over Streams of Tokens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Token-based world models emerged as a promising modular framework, modeling dynamics over token streams while optimizing tokenization separately. While successful in visual environments with discrete actions (e.g., Atari games), their broader applicability remains uncertain. In this paper, we introduce $\text{M}^{\text{3}}$, a $\textbf{m}$odular $\textbf{w}$orld $\textbf{m}$odel that extends this framework, enabling flexible combinations of observation and action modalities through independent modality-specific components. $\text{M}^{\text{3}}$ integrates several improvements from existing literature to enhance agent performance. Through extensive empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks, $\text{M}^{\text{3}}$ achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency for planning-free world models. Notably, among these methods, it is the first to reach a human-level median score on Atari 100K, with superhuman performance on 13 games. Our code and model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/leor-c/M3.</description>

      <title>Meta-Statistical Learning: Supervised Learning of Statistical Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that the tools and principles driving the success of large language models (LLMs) can be repurposed to tackle distribution-level tasks, where the goal is to predict properties of the data-generating distribution rather than labels for individual datapoints. These tasks encompass statistical inference problems such as parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, or mutual information estimation. Framing these tasks within traditional machine learning pipelines is challenging, as supervision is typically tied to individual datapoint. We propose meta-statistical learning, a framework inspired by multi-instance learning that reformulates statistical inference tasks as supervised learning problems. In this approach, entire datasets are treated as single inputs to neural networks, which predict distribution-level parameters. Transformer-based architectures, without positional encoding, provide a natural fit due to their permutation-invariance properties. By training on large-scale synthetic datasets, meta-statistical models can leverage the scalability and optimization infrastructure of Transformer-based LLMs. We demonstrate the framework's versatility with applications in hypothesis testing and mutual information estimation, showing strong performance, particularly for small datasets where traditional neural methods struggle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning in LLMs.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion kernels capture global dependencies. We present Linear Diffusion Networks (LDNs), a novel architecture that reinterprets sequential data processing as a unified diffusion process. Our model integrates adaptive diffusion modules with localized nonlinear updates and a diffusion-inspired attention mechanism. This design enables efficient global information propagation while preserving fine-grained temporal details. LDN overcomes the limitations of conventional recurrent and transformer models by allowing full parallelization across time steps and supporting robust multi-scale temporal representations. Experiments on benchmark sequence modeling tasks demonstrate that LDN delivers superior performance and scalability, setting a new standard for global interaction in sequential data.</description>

      <title>Contextual Linear Bandits with Delay as Payoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent work by Schlisselberg et al. (2024) studies a delay-as-payoff model for stochastic multi-armed bandits, where the payoff (either loss or reward) is delayed for a period that is proportional to the payoff itself. While this captures many real-world applications, the simple multi-armed bandit setting limits the practicality of their results. In this paper, we address this limitation by studying the delay-as-payoff model for contextual linear bandits. Specifically, we start from the case with a fixed action set and propose an efficient algorithm whose regret overhead compared to the standard no-delay case is at most $D\Delta_{\max}\log T$, where $T$ is the total horizon, $D$ is the maximum delay, and $\Delta_{\max}$ is the maximum suboptimality gap. When payoff is loss, we also show further improvement of the bound, demonstrating a separation between reward and loss similar to Schlisselberg et al. (2024). Contrary to standard linear bandit algorithms that construct least squares estimator and confidence ellipsoid, the main novelty of our algorithm is to apply a phased arm elimination procedure by only picking actions in a volumetric spanner of the action set, which addresses challenges arising from both payoff-dependent delays and large action sets. We further extend our results to the case with varying action sets by adopting the reduction from Hanna et al. (2023). Finally, we implement our algorithm and showcase its effectiveness and superior performance in experiments.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the Primacy Effect in Structured State-Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human and animal memory for sequentially presented items is well-documented to be more accurate for those at the beginning and end of the sequence, phenomena known as the primacy and recency effects, respectively. By contrast, artificial neural network (ANN) models are typically designed with a memory that decays monotonically over time. Accordingly, ANNs are expected to show the recency effect but not the primacy effect. Contrary to this theoretical expectation, however, the present study reveals a counterintuitive finding: a recently developed ANN architecture, called structured state-space models, exhibits the primacy effect when trained and evaluated on a synthetic task that mirrors psychological memory experiments. Given that this model was originally designed for recovering neuronal activity patterns observed in biological brains, this result provides a novel perspective on the psychological primacy effect while also posing a non-trivial puzzle for the current theories in machine learning.</description>

Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising alternative for high-fidelity data representation; however, to effectively handle spherical domains, these methods must be adapted to the inherent geometry of the sphere to maintain both accuracy and stability. In this context, we propose Herglotz-NET (HNET), a novel INR architecture that employs a harmonic positional encoding based on complex Herglotz mappings. This encoding yields a well-posed representation on the sphere with interpretable and robust spectral properties. Moreover, we present a unified expressivity analysis showing that any spherical-based INR satisfying a mild condition exhibits a predictable spectral expansion that scales with network depth. Our results establish HNET as a scalable and flexible framework for accurate modeling of spherical data.</description>

      <title>CoRRECT: A Deep Unfolding Framework for Motion-Corrected Quantitative R2* Mapping</title>

Abstract: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) refers to a class of MRI methods for quantifying the spatial distribution of biological tissue parameters. Traditional qMRI methods usually deal separately with artifacts arising from accelerated data acquisition, involuntary physical motion, and magnetic-field inhomogeneities, leading to suboptimal end-to-end performance. This paper presents CoRRECT, a unified deep unfolding (DU) framework for qMRI consisting of a model-based end-to-end neural network, a method for motion-artifact reduction, and a self-supervised learning scheme. The network is trained to produce R2* maps whose k-space data matches the real data by also accounting for motion and field inhomogeneities. When deployed, CoRRECT only uses the k-space data without any pre-computed parameters for motion or inhomogeneity correction. Our results on experimentally collected multi-Gradient-Recalled Echo (mGRE) MRI data show that CoRRECT recovers motion and inhomogeneity artifact-free R2* maps in highly accelerated acquisition settings. This work opens the door to DU methods that can integrate physical measurement models, biophysical signal models, and learned prior models for high-quality qMRI.</description>

      <title>UniASM: Binary Code Similarity Detection without Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01144v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) is widely used in various binary analysis tasks such as vulnerability search, malware detection, clone detection, and patch analysis. Recent studies have shown that the learning-based binary code embedding models perform better than the traditional feature-based approaches. However, previous studies have not delved deeply into the key factors that affect model performance. In this paper, we design extensive ablation studies to explore these influencing factors. The experimental results have provided us with many new insights. We have made innovations in both code representation and model selection: we propose a novel rich-semantic function representation technique to ensure the model captures the intricate nuances of binary code, and we introduce the first UniLM-based binary code embedding model, named UniASM, which includes two newly designed training tasks to learn representations of binary functions. The experimental results show that UniASM outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on the evaluation datasets. The average scores of Recall@1 on cross-compilers, cross-optimization-levels, and cross-obfuscations have improved by 12.7%, 8.5%, and 22.3%, respectively, compared to the best of the baseline methods. Besides, in the real-world task of known vulnerability search, UniASM outperforms all the current baselines.</description>

Abstract: Classification of high-dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) data poses a challenge in a variety of real-world situations, such as gene expression studies, cancer research, and medical imaging. This article presents the development and analysis of some classifiers that are specifically designed for HDLSS data. These classifiers are free of tuning parameters and are robust, in the sense that they are devoid of any moment conditions of the underlying data distributions. It is shown that they yield perfect classification in the HDLSS asymptotic regime, under some fairly general conditions. The comparative performance of the proposed classifiers is also investigated. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive simulation studies and real data analysis, which demonstrate promising advantages of the proposed classification techniques over several widely recognized methods.</description>

      <title>$O(k)$-Equivariant Dimensionality Reduction on Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world datasets live on high-dimensional Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds, $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ and $Gr(k, \mathbb{R}^N)$ respectively, and benefit from projection onto lower-dimensional Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds. In this work, we propose an algorithm called \textit{Principal Stiefel Coordinates (PSC)} to reduce data dimensionality from $ V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ to $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in an \textit{$O(k)$-equivariant} manner ($k \leq n \ll N$). We begin by observing that each element $\alpha \in V_n(\mathbb{R}^N)$ defines an isometric embedding of $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ into $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Next, we describe two ways of finding a suitable embedding map $\alpha$: one via an extension of principal component analysis ($\alpha_{PCA}$), and one that further minimizes data fit error using gradient descent ($\alpha_{GD}$). Then, we define a continuous and $O(k)$-equivariant map $\pi_\alpha$ that acts as a "closest point operator" to project the data onto the image of $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ under the embedding determined by $\alpha$, while minimizing distortion. Because this dimensionality reduction is $O(k)$-equivariant, these results extend to Grassmannian manifolds as well. Lastly, we show that $\pi_{\alpha_{PCA}}$ globally minimizes projection error in a noiseless setting, while $\pi_{\alpha_{GD}}$ achieves a meaningfully different and improved outcome when the data does not lie exactly on the image of a linearly embedded lower-dimensional Stiefel manifold as above. Multiple numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world data are performed.</description>

      <title>Robust Tumor Segmentation with Hyperspectral Imaging and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Segmenting the boundary between tumor and healthy tissue during surgical cancer resection poses a significant challenge. In recent years, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) combined with Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution. However, due to the extensive information contained within the spectral domain, most ML approaches primarily classify individual HSI (super-)pixels, or tiles, without taking into account their spatial context. In this paper, we propose an improved methodology that leverages the spatial context of tiles for more robust and smoother segmentation. To address the irregular shapes of tiles, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to propagate context information across neighboring regions. The features for each tile within the graph are extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained simultaneously with the subsequent GNN. Moreover, we incorporate local image quality metrics into the loss function to enhance the training procedure's robustness against low-quality regions in the training images. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method using a clinical ex vivo dataset consisting of 51 HSI images from 30 patients. Despite the limited dataset, the GNN-based model significantly outperforms context-agnostic approaches, accurately distinguishing between healthy and tumor tissues, even in images from previously unseen patients. Furthermore, we show that our carefully designed loss function, accounting for local image quality, results in additional improvements. Our findings demonstrate that context-aware GNN algorithms can robustly find tumor demarcations on HSI images, ultimately contributing to better surgery success and patient outcome.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Anomaly Detection for Lane Rendering Using Transformer with Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Customized Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04398v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Leave-One-Out-, Bootstrap- and Cross-Conformal Anomaly Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The requirement of uncertainty quantification for anomaly detection systems has become increasingly important. In this context, effectively controlling Type I error rates ($\alpha$) without compromising the statistical power ($1-\beta$) of these systems can build trust and reduce costs related to false discoveries. The field of conformal anomaly detection emerges as a promising approach for providing respective statistical guarantees by model calibration. However, the dependency on calibration data poses practical limitations - especially within low-data regimes. In this work, we formally define and evaluate leave-one-out-, bootstrap-, and cross-conformal methods for anomaly detection, incrementing on methods from the field of conformal prediction. Looking beyond the classical inductive conformal anomaly detection, we demonstrate that derived methods for calculating resampling-conformal $p$-values strike a practical compromise between statistical efficiency (full-conformal) and computational efficiency (split-conformal) as they make more efficient use of available data. We validate derived methods and quantify their improvements for a range of one-class classifiers and datasets.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Relationship Between Publication Bias and Chemical Reactivity with Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A synthetic method's substrate tolerance and generality are often showcased in a "substrate scope" table. However, substrate selection exhibits a frequently discussed publication bias: unsuccessful experiments or low-yielding results are rarely reported. In this work, we explore more deeply the relationship between such publication bias and chemical reactivity beyond the simple analysis of yield distributions using a novel neural network training strategy, substrate scope contrastive learning. By treating reported substrates as positive samples and non-reported substrates as negative samples, our contrastive learning strategy teaches a model to group molecules within a numerical embedding space, based on historical trends in published substrate scope tables. Training on 20,798 aryl halides in the CAS Content Collection$^{\text{TM}}$, spanning thousands of publications from 2010-2015, we demonstrate that the learned embeddings exhibit a correlation with physical organic reactivity descriptors through both intuitive visualizations and quantitative regression analyses. Additionally, these embeddings are applicable to various reaction modeling tasks like yield prediction and regioselectivity prediction, underscoring the potential to use historical reaction data as a pre-training task. This work not only presents a chemistry-specific machine learning training strategy to learn from literature data in a new way, but also represents a unique approach to uncover trends in chemical reactivity reflected by trends in substrate selection in publications.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Topology Optimization using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge is designing multi-scale structures with good connectivity between cells while optimizing each cell to reach close to the theoretical performance limit. We propose a new method for direct multi-scale topology optimization using neural networks. Our approach focuses on inverse homogenization that seamlessly maintains compatibility across neighboring microstructure cells. Our approach consists of a topology neural network that optimizes the microstructure shape and distribution across the design domain as a continuous field. Each microstructure cell is optimized based on a specified elasticity tensor that also accommodates in-plane rotations. The neural network takes as input the local coordinates within a cell to represent the density distribution within a cell, as well as the global coordinates of each cell to design spatially varying microstructure cells. As such, our approach models an n-dimensional multi-scale optimization problem as a 2n-dimensional inverse homogenization problem using neural networks. During the inverse homogenization of each unit cell, we extend the boundary of each cell by scaling the input coordinates such that the boundaries of neighboring cells are combined. Inverse homogenization on the combined cell improves connectivity. We demonstrate our method through the design and optimization of graded multi-scale structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an unconditional diffusion model targeting a joint model $\pi(x, y)$, using it to perform conditional simulation $\pi(x \mid y)$ is still largely an open question and is typically achieved by learning conditional drifts to the denoising SDE after the fact. In this work, we express \emph{exact} conditional simulation within the \emph{approximate} diffusion model as an inference problem on an augmented space corresponding to a partial SDE bridge. This perspective allows us to implement efficient and principled particle Gibbs and pseudo-marginal samplers marginally targeting the conditional distribution $\pi(x \mid y)$. Contrary to existing methodology, our methods do not introduce any additional approximation to the unconditional diffusion model aside from the Monte Carlo error. We showcase the benefits and drawbacks of our approach on a series of synthetic and real data examples.</description>

      <title>eQMARL: Entangled Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Cooperation over Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaboration is a key challenge in distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments. Learning frameworks for these decentralized systems must weigh the benefits of explicit player coordination against the communication overhead and computational cost of sharing local observations and environmental data. Quantum computing has sparked a potential synergy between quantum entanglement and cooperation in multi-agent environments, which could enable more efficient distributed collaboration with minimal information sharing. This relationship is largely unexplored, however, as current state-of-the-art quantum MARL (QMARL) implementations rely on classical information sharing rather than entanglement over a quantum channel as a coordination medium. In contrast, in this paper, a novel framework dubbed entangled QMARL (eQMARL) is proposed. The proposed eQMARL is a distributed actor-critic framework that facilitates cooperation over a quantum channel and eliminates local observation sharing via a quantum entangled split critic. Introducing a quantum critic uniquely spread across the agents allows coupling of local observation encoders through entangled input qubits over a quantum channel, which requires no explicit sharing of local observations and reduces classical communication overhead. Further, agent policies are tuned through joint observation-value function estimation via joint quantum measurements, thereby reducing the centralized computational burden. Experimental results show that eQMARL with ${\Psi}^{+}$ entanglement converges to a cooperative strategy up to $17.8\%$ faster and with a higher overall score compared to split classical and fully centralized classical and quantum baselines. The results also show that eQMARL achieves this performance with a constant factor of $25$-times fewer centralized parameters compared to the split classical baseline.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Confidence Estimation via Black-Box Access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating uncertainty or confidence in the responses of a model can be significant in evaluating trust not only in the responses, but also in the model as a whole. In this paper, we explore the problem of estimating confidence for responses of large language models (LLMs) with simply black-box or query access to them. We propose a simple and extensible framework where, we engineer novel features and train a (interpretable) model (viz. logistic regression) on these features to estimate the confidence. We empirically demonstrate that our simple framework is effective in estimating confidence of Flan-ul2, Llama-13b, Mistral-7b and GPT-4 on four benchmark Q\&amp;A tasks as well as of Pegasus-large and BART-large on two benchmark summarization tasks with it surpassing baselines by even over $10\%$ (on AUROC) in some cases. Additionally, our interpretable approach provides insight into features that are predictive of confidence, leading to the interesting and useful discovery that our confidence models built for one LLM generalize zero-shot across others on a given dataset.</description>

      <title>Data Attribution for Text-to-Image Models by Unlearning Synthesized Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of data attribution for text-to-image models is to identify the training images that most influence the generation of a new image. Influence is defined such that, for a given output, if a model is retrained from scratch without the most influential images, the model would fail to reproduce the same output. Unfortunately, directly searching for these influential images is computationally infeasible, since it would require repeatedly retraining models from scratch. In our work, we propose an efficient data attribution method by simulating unlearning the synthesized image. We achieve this by increasing the training loss on the output image, without catastrophic forgetting of other, unrelated concepts. We then identify training images with significant loss deviations after the unlearning process and label these as influential. We evaluate our method with a computationally intensive but "gold-standard" retraining from scratch and demonstrate our method's advantages over previous methods.</description>

      <title>DP-MemArc: Differential Privacy Transfer Learning for Memory Efficient Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11087v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have repeatedly shown outstanding performance across diverse applications. However, deploying these models can inadvertently risk user privacy. The significant memory demands during training pose a major challenge in terms of resource consumption. This substantial size places a heavy load on memory resources, raising considerable practical concerns. In this paper, we introduce DP-MemArc, a novel training framework aimed at reducing the memory costs of large language models while emphasizing the protection of user data privacy. DP-MemArc incorporates side network or reversible network designs to support a variety of differential privacy memory-efficient fine-tuning schemes. Our approach not only achieves about 2.5 times in memory optimization but also ensures robust privacy protection, keeping user data secure and confidential. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that DP-MemArc effectively provides differential privacy-efficient fine-tuning across different task scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Semantic-Aware Layer-Freezing Approach to Computation-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finetuning language models (LMs) is crucial for adapting the models to downstream data and tasks. However, full finetuning is usually costly. Existing work, such as parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT), often focuses on \textit{how to finetune} but neglects the issue of \textit{where to finetune}. As a pioneering work on reducing the cost of backpropagation (at the layer level) by answering where to finetune, we conduct a semantic analysis of the LM inference process. We first propose using transition traces of the latent representation to compute deviations (or loss). Then, using a derived formula of scaling law, we estimate the gain of each layer in reducing deviation (or loss). Further, we narrow down the scope for finetuning, and also, study the cost-benefit balance of LM finetuning. We perform extensive experiments across well-known LMs and datasets. The results show that our approach is effective and efficient, and outperforms the existing baselines. Our approach is orthogonal to other techniques on improving finetuning efficiency, such as PEFT methods, offering practical values on LM finetuning.</description>

      <title>metabench -- A Sparse Benchmark of Reasoning and Knowledge in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary in their abilities on a range of tasks. Initiatives such as the Open LLM Leaderboard aim to quantify these differences with several large benchmarks (sets of test items to which an LLM can respond either correctly or incorrectly). However, high correlations within and between benchmark scores suggest that (1) there exists a small set of common underlying abilities that these benchmarks measure, and (2) items tap into redundant information and the benchmarks may thus be considerably compressed. We use data from n &gt; 5000 LLMs to identify the most informative items of six benchmarks, ARC, GSM8K, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA and WinoGrande (with d = 28,632 items in total). From them we distill a sparse benchmark, metabench, that has less than 3% of the original size of all six benchmarks combined. This new sparse benchmark goes beyond point scores by yielding estimators of the underlying benchmark-specific abilities. We show that these estimators (1) can be used to reconstruct each original individual benchmark score with, on average, 1.24% root mean square error (RMSE), (2) reconstruct the original total score with 0.58% RMSE, and (3) have a single underlying common factor whose Spearman correlation with the total score is r = 0.94.</description>

      <title>Imputation for prediction: beware of diminishing returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Missing values are prevalent across various fields, posing challenges for training and deploying predictive models. In this context, imputation is a common practice, driven by the hope that accurate imputations will enhance predictions. However, recent theoretical and empirical studies indicate that simple constant imputation can be consistent and competitive. This empirical study aims at clarifying if and when investing in advanced imputation methods yields significantly better predictions. Relating imputation and predictive accuracies across combinations of imputation and predictive models on 19 datasets, we show that imputation accuracy matters less i) when using expressive models, ii) when incorporating missingness indicators as complementary inputs, iii) matters much more for generated linear outcomes than for real-data outcomes. Interestingly, we also show that the use of the missingness indicator is beneficial to the prediction performance, even in MCAR scenarios. Overall, on real-data with powerful models, improving imputation only has a minor effect on prediction performance. Thus, investing in better imputations for improved predictions often offers limited benefits.</description>

      <title>Extracting Sentence Embeddings from Pretrained Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained transformer models shine in many natural language processing tasks and therefore are expected to bear the representation of the input sentence or text meaning. These sentence-level embeddings are also important in retrieval-augmented generation. But do commonly used plain averaging or prompt templates sufficiently capture and represent the underlying meaning? After providing a comprehensive review of existing sentence embedding extraction and refinement methods, we thoroughly test different combinations and our original extensions of the most promising ones on pretrained models. Namely, given 110 M parameters, BERT's hidden representations from multiple layers, and many tokens, we try diverse ways to extract optimal sentence embeddings. We test various token aggregation and representation post-processing techniques. We also test multiple ways of using a general Wikitext dataset to complement BERT's sentence embeddings. All methods are tested on eight Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), six short text clustering, and twelve classification tasks. We also evaluate our representation-shaping techniques on other static models, including random token representations. Proposed representation extraction methods improve the performance on STS and clustering tasks for all models considered. Very high improvements for static token-based models, especially random embeddings for STS tasks, almost reach the performance of BERT-derived representations. Our work shows that the representation-shaping techniques significantly improve sentence embeddings extracted from BERT-based and simple baseline models.</description>

      <title>View-Invariant Policy Learning via Zero-Shot Novel View Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale visuomotor policy learning is a promising approach toward developing generalizable manipulation systems. Yet, policies that can be deployed on diverse embodiments, environments, and observational modalities remain elusive. In this work, we investigate how knowledge from large-scale visual data of the world may be used to address one axis of variation for generalizable manipulation: observational viewpoint. Specifically, we study single-image novel view synthesis models, which learn 3D-aware scene-level priors by rendering images of the same scene from alternate camera viewpoints given a single input image. For practical application to diverse robotic data, these models must operate zero-shot, performing view synthesis on unseen tasks and environments. We empirically analyze view synthesis models within a simple data-augmentation scheme that we call View Synthesis Augmentation (VISTA) to understand their capabilities for learning viewpoint-invariant policies from single-viewpoint demonstration data. Upon evaluating the robustness of policies trained with our method to out-of-distribution camera viewpoints, we find that they outperform baselines in both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks.

      <title>CKnowEdit: A New Chinese Knowledge Editing Dataset for Linguistics, Facts, and Logic Error Correction in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chinese, as a linguistic system rich in depth and complexity, is characterized by distinctive elements such as ancient poetry, proverbs, idioms, and other cultural constructs. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in these specialized domains, highlighting the need for the development of comprehensive datasets that can assess, continuously update, and progressively improve these culturally-grounded linguistic competencies through targeted training optimizations. To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques reveals opportunities to advance the correction of Chinese knowledge. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</description>

      <title>Revisiting In-context Learning Inference Circuit in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm on Language Models (LMs) with inner mechanisms un-explored. There are already existing works describing the inner processing of ICL, while they struggle to capture all the inference phenomena in large language models. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive circuit to model the inference dynamics and try to explain the observed phenomena of ICL. In detail, we divide ICL inference into 3 major operations: (1) Input Text Encode: LMs encode every input text (in the demonstrations and queries) into linear representation in the hidden states with sufficient information to solve ICL tasks. (2) Semantics Merge: LMs merge the encoded representations of demonstrations with their corresponding label tokens to produce joint representations of labels and demonstrations. (3) Feature Retrieval and Copy: LMs search the joint representations of demonstrations similar to the query representation on a task subspace, and copy the searched representations into the query. Then, language model heads capture these copied label representations to a certain extent and decode them into predicted labels. Through careful measurements, the proposed inference circuit successfully captures and unifies many fragmented phenomena observed during the ICL process, making it a comprehensive and practical explanation of the ICL inference process. Moreover, ablation analysis by disabling the proposed steps seriously damages the ICL performance, suggesting the proposed inference circuit is a dominating mechanism. Additionally, we confirm and list some bypass mechanisms that solve ICL tasks in parallel with the proposed circuit.</description>

      <title>Do Contemporary Causal Inference Models Capture Real-World Heterogeneity? Findings from a Large-Scale Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present unexpected findings from a large-scale benchmark study evaluating Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation algorithms, i.e., CATE models. By running 16 modern CATE models on 12 datasets and 43,200 sampled variants generated through diverse observational sampling strategies, we find that: (a) 62\% of CATE estimates have a higher Mean Squared Error (MSE) than a trivial zero-effect predictor, rendering them ineffective; (b) in datasets with at least one useful CATE estimate, 80\% still have higher MSE than a constant-effect model; and (c) Orthogonality-based models outperform other models only 30\% of the time, despite widespread optimism about their performance. These findings highlight significant challenges in current CATE models and underscore the need for broader evaluation and methodological improvements.
  Our findings stem from a novel application of \textit{observational sampling}, originally developed to evaluate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimates from observational methods with experiment data. To adapt observational sampling for CATE evaluation, we introduce a statistical parameter, $Q$, equal to MSE minus a constant and preserves the ranking of models by their MSE. We then derive a family of sample statistics, collectively called $\hat{Q}$, that can be computed from real-world data. When used in observational sampling, $\hat{Q}$ is an unbiased estimator of $Q$ and asymptotically selects the model with the smallest MSE. To ensure the benchmark reflects real-world heterogeneity, we handpick datasets where outcomes come from field rather than simulation. By integrating observational sampling, new statistics, and real-world datasets, the benchmark provides new insights into CATE model performance and reveals gaps in capturing real-world heterogeneity, emphasizing the need for more robust benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Addressing Rotational Learning Dynamics in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems through agents' cooperation and competition, finding widespread applications across domains. Despite its success, MARL faces a reproducibility crisis. We show that, in part, this issue is related to the rotational optimization dynamics arising from competing agents' objectives, and require methods beyond standard optimization algorithms. We reframe MARL approaches using Variational Inequalities (VIs), offering a unified framework to address such issues. Leveraging optimization techniques designed for VIs, we propose a general approach for integrating gradient-based VI methods capable of handling rotational dynamics into existing MARL algorithms. Empirical results demonstrate significant performance improvements across benchmarks. In zero-sum games, Rock--paper--scissors and Matching pennies, VI methods achieve better convergence to equilibrium strategies, and in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment: Predator-prey, they also enhance team coordination. These results underscore the transformative potential of advanced optimization techniques in MARL.</description>

      <title>MergePrint: Merge-Resistant Fingerprints for Robust Black-box Ownership Verification of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protecting the intellectual property of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly critical due to the high cost of training. Model merging, which integrates multiple expert models into a single multi-task model, introduces a novel risk of unauthorized use of LLMs due to its efficient merging process. While fingerprinting techniques have been proposed for verifying model ownership, their resistance to model merging remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel fingerprinting method, MergePrint, which embeds robust fingerprints capable of surviving model merging. MergePrint enables black-box ownership verification, where owners only need to check if a model produces target outputs for specific fingerprint inputs, without accessing model weights or intermediate outputs. By optimizing against a pseudo-merged model that simulates merged behavior, MergePrint ensures fingerprints that remain detectable after merging. Additionally, to minimize performance degradation, we pre-optimize the fingerprint inputs. MergePrint pioneers a practical solution for black-box ownership verification, protecting LLMs from misappropriation via merging, while also excelling in resistance to broader model theft threats.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Neural Goodness-of-Fit Test for Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13986v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series data are crucial across diverse domains such as finance and healthcare, where accurate forecasting and decision-making rely on advanced modeling techniques. While generative models have shown great promise in capturing the intricate dynamics inherent in time series, evaluating their performance remains a major challenge. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short due to the temporal dependencies and potential high dimensionality of the features. In this paper, we propose the REcurrent NeurAL (RENAL) Goodness-of-Fit test, a novel and statistically rigorous framework for evaluating generative time series models. By leveraging recurrent neural networks, we transform the time series into conditionally independent data pairs, enabling the application of a chi-square-based goodness-of-fit test to the temporal dependencies within the data. This approach offers a robust, theoretically grounded solution for assessing the quality of generative models, particularly in settings with limited time sequences. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy. Our method fills a critical gap in the evaluation of time series generative models, offering a tool that is both practical and adaptable to high-stakes applications.</description>

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) offers promising new approaches for recommendation system tasks. While the current state-of-the-art methods rely on fine-tuning LLMs to achieve optimal results, this process is costly and introduces significant engineering complexities. Conversely, methods that directly use LLMs without additional fine-tuning result in a large drop in recommendation quality, often due to the inability to capture collaborative information. In this paper, we propose a Simple Training-free Approach for Recommendation (STAR), a framework that utilizes LLMs and can be applied to various recommendation tasks without the need for fine-tuning, while maintaining high quality recommendation performance. Our approach involves a retrieval stage that uses semantic embeddings from LLMs combined with collaborative user information to retrieve candidate items. We then apply an LLM for pairwise ranking to enhance next-item prediction. Experimental results on the Amazon Review dataset show competitive performance for next item prediction, even with our retrieval stage alone. Our full method achieves Hits@10 performance of +23.8% on Beauty, +37.5% on Toys &amp; Games, and -1.8% on Sports &amp; Outdoors relative to the best supervised models. This framework offers an effective alternative to traditional supervised models, highlighting the potential of LLMs in recommendation systems without extensive training or custom architectures.</description>

      <title>Do Audio-Language Models Understand Linguistic Variations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary audio language models (ALMs), like Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP), represent a promising new paradigm for audio-text retrieval using natural language queries. In this paper, for the first time, we perform controlled experiments on various benchmarks to show that existing ALMs struggle to generalize to linguistic variations in textual queries. To address this issue, we propose RobustCLAP, a novel and compute-efficient technique to learn audio-language representations agnostic to linguistic variations. Specifically, we reformulate the contrastive loss used in CLAP architectures by introducing a multi-view contrastive learning objective, where paraphrases are treated as different views of the same audio scene and use this for training. Our proposed approach improves the text-to-audio retrieval performance of CLAP by 0.8%-13% across benchmarks and enhances robustness to linguistic variation.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Diffusion Language Models for Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in autoregressive language models, alternative generative paradigms beyond left-to-right generation are still being actively explored. Discrete diffusion models, with the capacity for parallel generation, have recently emerged as a promising alternative. Unfortunately, these models still underperform the autoregressive counterparts, with the performance gap increasing when reducing the number of sampling steps. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is a consequence of an imperfect approximation used by diffusion models. In this work, we propose Energy-based Diffusion Language Model (EDLM), an energy-based model operating at the full sequence level for each diffusion step, introduced to improve the underlying approximation used by diffusion models. More specifically, we introduce an EBM in a residual form, and show that its parameters can be obtained by leveraging a pretrained autoregressive model or by finetuning a bidirectional transformer via noise contrastive estimation. We also propose an efficient generation algorithm via parallel important sampling. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks show that our model can consistently outperform state-of-the-art diffusion models by a significant margin, and approaches autoregressive models' perplexity. We further show that, without any generation performance drop, our framework offers a 1.3$\times$ sampling speedup over existing diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Soft Condorcet Optimization for Ranking of General Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driving progress of AI models and agents requires comparing their performance on standardized benchmarks; for general agents, individual performances must be aggregated across a potentially wide variety of different tasks. In this paper, we describe a novel ranking scheme inspired by social choice frameworks, called Soft Condorcet Optimization (SCO), to compute the optimal ranking of agents: the one that makes the fewest mistakes in predicting the agent comparisons in the evaluation data. This optimal ranking is the maximum likelihood estimate when evaluation data (which we view as votes) are interpreted as noisy samples from a ground truth ranking, a solution to Condorcet's original voting system criteria. SCO ratings are maximal for Condorcet winners when they exist, which we show is not necessarily true for the classical rating system Elo. We propose three optimization algorithms to compute SCO ratings and evaluate their empirical performance. When serving as an approximation to the Kemeny-Young voting method, SCO rankings are on average 0 to 0.043 away from the optimal ranking in normalized Kendall-tau distance across 865 preference profiles from the PrefLib open ranking archive. In a simulated noisy tournament setting, SCO achieves accurate approximations to the ground truth ranking and the best among several baselines when 59\% or more of the preference data is missing. Finally, SCO ranking provides the best approximation to the optimal ranking, measured on held-out test sets, in a problem containing 52,958 human players across 31,049 games of the classic seven-player game of Diplomacy.</description>

      <title>Model agnostic local variable importance for locally dependent relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global variable importance measures are commonly used to interpret the results of machine learning models. Local variable importance techniques assess how variables contribute to individual observations. Current methods typically fail to accurately reflect locally dependent relationships between variables and instead focus on marginal importance values. Additionally, they are not natively adapted for multi-class classification problems. We propose a new model-agnostic method for calculating local variable importance, CLIQUE, that captures locally dependent relationships, improves over permutation-based methods, and can be directly applied to multi-category classification problems. Simulated and real-world examples show that CLIQUE emphasizes locally dependent information and properly reduces bias in regions where variables do not affect the response.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</description>

      <title>Non-Contextual BERT or FastText? A Comparative Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages, which lack large annotated datasets, faces significant challenges due to limited high-quality data and linguistic resources. The selection of embeddings plays a critical role in achieving strong performance in NLP tasks. While contextual BERT embeddings require a full forward pass, non-contextual BERT embeddings rely only on table lookup. Existing research has primarily focused on contextual BERT embeddings, leaving non-contextual embeddings largely unexplored. In this study, we analyze the effectiveness of non-contextual embeddings from BERT models (MuRIL and MahaBERT) and FastText models (IndicFT and MahaFT) for tasks such as news classification, sentiment analysis, and hate speech detection in one such low-resource language Marathi. We compare these embeddings with their contextual and compressed variants. Our findings indicate that non-contextual BERT embeddings extracted from the model's first embedding layer outperform FastText embeddings, presenting a promising alternative for low-resource NLP.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Logistic Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of the Thompson Sampling algorithm for logistic bandit problems. In this setting, an agent receives binary rewards with probabilities determined by a logistic function, $\exp(\beta \langle a, \theta \rangle)/(1+\exp(\beta \langle a, \theta \rangle))$, with slope parameter $\beta&gt;0$, and where both the action $a\in \mathcal{A}$ and parameter $\theta \in \mathcal{O}$ lie within the $d$-dimensional unit ball. Adopting the information-theoretic framework introduced by Russo and Van Roy (2016), we analyze the information ratio, a statistic that quantifies the trade-off between the immediate regret incurred and the information gained about the optimal action. We improve upon previous results by establishing that the information ratio is bounded by $\tfrac{9}{2}d\alpha^{-2}$, where $\alpha$ is a minimax measure of the alignment between the action space $\mathcal{A}$ and the parameter space $\mathcal{O}$, and is independent of $\beta$. Using this result, we derive a bound of order $O(d/\alpha\sqrt{T \log(\beta T/d)})$ on the Bayesian expected regret of Thompson Sampling incurred after $T$ time steps. To our knowledge, this is the first regret bound for logistic bandits that depends only logarithmically on $\beta$ while being independent of the number of actions. In particular, when the action space contains the parameter space, the bound on the expected regret is of order $\tilde{O}(d \sqrt{T})$.</description>

      <title>The Computational Limits of State-Space Models and Mamba via the Lens of Circuit Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the computational limitations of Mamba and State-space Models (SSMs) by using the circuit complexity framework. Despite Mamba's stateful design and recent attention as a strong candidate to outperform Transformers, we have demonstrated that both Mamba and SSMs with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision and constant-depth layers reside within the $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class. This result indicates Mamba has the same computational capabilities as Transformer theoretically, and it cannot solve problems like arithmetic formula problems, boolean formula value problems, and permutation composition problems if $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$. Therefore, it challenges the assumption Mamba is more computationally expressive than Transformers. Our contributions include rigorous proofs showing that Selective SSM and Mamba architectures can be simulated by $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ circuits, and they cannot solve problems outside $\mathsf{TC}^0$.</description>

      <title>Robust Feature Engineering Techniques for Designing Efficient Motor Imagery-Based BCI-Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multitude of individuals across the globe grapple with motor disabilities. Neural prosthetics utilizing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology exhibit promise for improving motor rehabilitation outcomes. The intricate nature of EEG data poses a significant hurdle for current BCI systems. Recently, a qualitative repository of EEG signals tied to both upper and lower limb execution of motor and motor imagery tasks has been unveiled. Despite this, the productivity of the Machine Learning (ML) Models that were trained on this dataset was alarmingly deficient, and the evaluation framework seemed insufficient. To enhance outcomes, robust feature engineering (signal processing) methodologies are implemented. A collection of time domain, frequency domain, and wavelet-derived features was obtained from 16-channel EEG signals, and the Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR) approach was employed to identify the four most significant features. For classification K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Na\"ive Bayes (NB) models were implemented with these selected features, evaluating their effectiveness through metrics such as testing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score. By leveraging SVM with a Gaussian Kernel, a remarkable maximum testing accuracy of 92.50% for motor activities and 95.48% for imagery activities is achieved. These results are notably more dependable and gratifying compared to the previous study, where the peak accuracy was recorded at 74.36%. This research work provides an in-depth analysis of the MI Limb EEG dataset and it will help in designing and developing simple, cost-effective and reliable BCI systems for neuro-rehabilitation.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the forces: assessing non-conservative force models for atomistic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to estimate the energy of a group of atoms, and the forces that drive them to more stable configurations, have revolutionized the fields of computational chemistry and materials discovery. In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically-constrained approach, suggesting that using the forces as explicit learning targets yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency - and that energy conservation can be learned during training. The present work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Contrary to the case of rotational symmetry, lack of energy conservation is hard to learn, control, and correct. The best approach to exploit the acceleration afforded by direct force evaluation might be to use it in tandem with a conservative model, reducing - rather than eliminating - the additional cost of backpropagation, but avoiding most of the pathological behavior associated with non-conservative forces.</description>

      <title>Learning to Play Against Unknown Opponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a learning agent who has to repeatedly play a general sum game against a strategic opponent who acts to maximize their own payoff by optimally responding against the learner's algorithm. The learning agent knows their own payoff function, but is uncertain about the payoff of their opponent (knowing only that it is drawn from some distribution $\mathcal{D}$). What learning algorithm should the agent run in order to maximize their own total utility, either in expectation or in the worst-case over $\mathcal{D}$?
  When the learning algorithm is constrained to be a no-regret algorithm, we demonstrate how to efficiently construct an optimal learning algorithm (asymptotically achieving the optimal utility) in polynomial time for both the in-expectation and worst-case problems, independent of any other assumptions. When the learning algorithm is not constrained to no-regret, we show how to construct an $\varepsilon$-optimal learning algorithm (obtaining average utility within $\varepsilon$ of the optimal utility) for both the in-expectation and worst-case problems in time polynomial in the size of the input and $1/\varepsilon$, when either the size of the game or the support of $\mathcal{D}$ is constant. Finally, for the special case of the maximin objective, where the learner wishes to maximize their minimum payoff over all possible optimizer types, we construct a learner algorithm that runs in polynomial time in each step and guarantees convergence to the optimal learner payoff. All of these results make use of recently developed machinery that converts the analysis of learning algorithms to the study of the class of corresponding geometric objects known as menus.</description>

      <title>Bridging Smart Meter Gaps: A Benchmark of Statistical, Machine Learning and Time Series Foundation Models for Data Imputation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integrity of time series data in smart grids is often compromised by missing values due to sensor failures, transmission errors, or disruptions. Gaps in smart meter data can bias consumption analyses and hinder reliable predictions, causing technical and economic inefficiencies. As smart meter data grows in volume and complexity, conventional techniques struggle with its nonlinear and nonstationary patterns. In this context, Generative Artificial Intelligence offers promising solutions that may outperform traditional statistical methods. In this paper, we evaluate two general-purpose Large Language Models and five Time Series Foundation Models for smart meter data imputation, comparing them with conventional Machine Learning and statistical models. We introduce artificial gaps (30 minutes to one day) into an anonymized public dataset to test inference capabilities. Results show that Time Series Foundation Models, with their contextual understanding and pattern recognition, could significantly enhance imputation accuracy in certain cases. However, the trade-off between computational cost and performance gains remains a critical consideration.</description>

      <title>OmniThink: Expanding Knowledge Boundaries in Machine Writing through Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, novelty, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, unoriginal, and repetitive outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a slow-thinking machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they slowly deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles.</description>

Abstract: We introduce MedXpertQA, a highly challenging and comprehensive benchmark to evaluate expert-level medical knowledge and advanced reasoning. MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 16 leading models on MedXpertQA. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Bias of Next Token Prediction Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of Large Language Models (LLMs), the quest to efficiently train them for superior reasoning capabilities has been a pivotal challenge. The dominant training paradigm for LLMs is based on next token prediction (NTP). Alternative methodologies, called Critical Token Prediction (CTP), focused exclusively on specific critical tokens (such as the answer in Q\&amp;A dataset), aiming to reduce the overfitting of extraneous information and noise. Contrary to initial assumptions, our research reveals that despite NTP's exposure to noise during training, it surpasses CTP in reasoning ability. We attribute this counterintuitive outcome to the regularizing influence of noise on the training dynamics. Our empirical analysis shows that NTP-trained models exhibit enhanced generalization and robustness across various benchmark reasoning datasets, demonstrating greater resilience to perturbations and achieving flatter loss minima. These findings illuminate that NTP is instrumental in fostering reasoning abilities during pretraining, whereas CTP is more effective for finetuning, thereby enriching our comprehension of optimal training strategies in LLM development.</description>

      <title>MAGNNET: Multi-Agent Graph Neural Network-based Efficient Task Allocation for Autonomous Vehicles with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of decentralized task allocation within heterogeneous multi-agent systems operating under communication constraints. We introduce a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, further enhanced by a tailored Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). Our approach enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to dynamically allocate tasks efficiently without necessitating central coordination in a 3D grid environment. The framework minimizes total travel time while simultaneously avoiding conflicts in task assignments. For the cost calculation and routing, we employ reservation-based A* and R* path planners. Experimental results revealed that our method achieves a high 92.5% conflict-free success rate, with only a 7.49% performance gap compared to the centralized Hungarian method, while outperforming the heuristic decentralized baseline based on greedy approach. Additionally, the framework exhibits scalability with up to 20 agents with allocation processing of 2.8 s and robustness in responding to dynamically generated tasks, underscoring its potential for real-world applications in complex multi-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>BaxBench: Can LLMs Generate Correct and Secure Backends?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The automatic generation of programs has long been a fundamental challenge in computer science. Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models (LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits, and solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs should be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application modules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we introduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for the generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical reasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of most modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right, requiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality, and (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted third-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an imperative. BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications with comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by executing end-to-end exploits. Our experiments reveal key limitations of current LLMs in both functionality and security: (i) even the best model, OpenAI o1, achieves a mere 60% on code correctness; (ii) on average, we could successfully execute security exploits on more than half of the correct programs generated by each LLM; and (iii) in less popular backend frameworks, models further struggle to generate correct and secure applications. Progress on BaxBench signifies important steps towards autonomous and secure software development with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Tensor Decomposition in Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor decomposition has emerged as a powerful framework for feature extraction in multi-modal biomedical data. In this review, we present a comprehensive analysis of tensor decomposition methods such as Tucker, CANDECOMP/PARAFAC, spiked tensor decomposition, etc. and their diverse applications across biomedical domains such as imaging, multi-omics, and spatial transcriptomics. To systematically investigate the literature, we applied a topic modeling-based approach that identifies and groups distinct thematic sub-areas in biomedicine where tensor decomposition has been used, thereby revealing key trends and research directions. We evaluated challenges related to the scalability of latent spaces along with obtaining the optimal rank of the tensor, which often hinder the extraction of meaningful features from increasingly large and complex datasets. Additionally, we discuss recent advances in quantum algorithms for tensor decomposition, exploring how quantum computing can be leveraged to address these challenges. Our study includes a preliminary resource estimation analysis for quantum computing platforms and examines the feasibility of implementing quantum-enhanced tensor decomposition methods on near-term quantum devices. Collectively, this review not only synthesizes current applications and challenges of tensor decomposition in biomedical analyses but also outlines promising quantum computing strategies to enhance its impact on deriving actionable insights from complex biomedical data.</description>

      <title>Identifying metric structures of deep latent variable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep latent variable models learn condensed representations of data that, hopefully, reflect the inner workings of the studied phenomena. Unfortunately, these latent representations are not statistically identifiable, meaning they cannot be uniquely determined. Domain experts, therefore, need to tread carefully when interpreting these. Current solutions limit the lack of identifiability through additional constraints on the latent variable model, e.g. by requiring labeled training data, or by restricting the expressivity of the model. We change the goal: instead of identifying the latent variables, we identify relationships between them such as meaningful distances, angles, and volumes. We prove this is feasible under very mild model conditions and without additional labeled data. We empirically demonstrate that our theory results in more reliable latent distances, offering a principled path forward in extracting trustworthy conclusions from deep latent variable models.</description>

      <title>LongPO: Long Context Self-Evolution of Large Language Models through Short-to-Long Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities through pretraining and alignment. However, superior short-context LLMs may underperform in long-context scenarios due to insufficient long-context alignment. This alignment process remains challenging due to the impracticality of human annotation for extended contexts and the difficulty in balancing short- and long-context performance. To address these challenges, we introduce LongPO, that enables short-context LLMs to self-evolve to excel on long-context tasks by internally transferring short-context capabilities. LongPO harnesses LLMs to learn from self-generated short-to-long preference data, comprising paired responses generated for identical instructions with long-context inputs and their compressed short-context counterparts, respectively. This preference reveals capabilities and potentials of LLMs cultivated during short-context alignment that may be diminished in under-aligned long-context scenarios. Additionally, LongPO incorporates a short-to-long KL constraint to mitigate short-context performance decline during long-context alignment. When applied to Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 from 128K to 512K context lengths, LongPO fully retains short-context performance and largely outperforms naive SFT and DPO in both long- and short-context tasks. Specifically, LongPO-trained models can achieve results on long-context benchmarks comparable to, or even surpassing, those of superior LLMs (e.g., GPT-4-128K) that involve extensive long-context annotation and larger parameter scales. Our code is available at https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/LongPO.</description>

      <title>Where's the Bug? Attention Probing for Scalable Fault Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring code correctness remains a challenging problem even as large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable at code-related tasks. While LLM-based program repair systems can propose bug fixes using only a user's bug report, their effectiveness is fundamentally limited by their ability to perform fault localization (FL), a challenging problem for both humans and LLMs. Existing FL approaches rely on executable test cases, require training on costly and often noisy line-level annotations, or demand resource-intensive LLMs. In this paper, we present Bug Attention Probe (BAP), a method which learns state-of-the-art fault localization without any direct localization labels, outperforming traditional FL baselines and prompting of large-scale LLMs. We evaluate our approach across a variety of code settings, including real-world Java bugs from the standard Defects4J dataset as well as seven other datasets which span a diverse set of bug types and languages. Averaged across all eight datasets, BAP improves by 34.6% top-1 accuracy compared to the strongest baseline and 93.4% over zero-shot prompting GPT-4o. BAP is also significantly more efficient than prompting, outperforming large open-weight models at a small fraction of the computational cost.</description>
