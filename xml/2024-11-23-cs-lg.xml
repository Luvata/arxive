      <title>Differentially Private Learning Beyond the Classical Dimensionality Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of differentially private learning in the proportional dimensionality regime, in which the number of data samples $n$ and problem dimension $d$ approach infinity at rates proportional to one another, meaning that $d / n \to \delta$ as $n \to \infty$ for an arbitrary, given constant $\delta \in (0, \infty)$. This setting is significantly more challenging than that of all prior theoretical work in high-dimensional differentially private learning, which, despite the name, has assumed that $\delta = 0$ or is sufficiently small for problems of sample complexity $O(d)$, a regime typically considered "low-dimensional" or "classical" by modern standards in high-dimensional statistics.
  We provide sharp theoretical estimates of the error of several well-studied differentially private algorithms for robust linear regression and logistic regression, including output perturbation, objective perturbation, and noisy stochastic gradient descent, in the proportional dimensionality regime. The $1 + o(1)$ factor precision of our error estimates enables a far more nuanced understanding of the price of privacy of these algorithms than that afforded by existing, coarser analyses, which are essentially vacuous in the regime we consider.
  We incorporate several probabilistic tools that have not previously been used to analyze differentially private learning algorithms, such as a modern Gaussian comparison inequality and recent universality laws with origins in statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Investigating Graph Neural Networks and Classical Feature-Extraction Techniques in Activity-Cliff and Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular featurisation refers to the transformation of molecular data into numerical feature vectors. It is one of the key research areas in molecular machine learning and computational drug discovery. Recently, message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a novel method to learn differentiable features directly from molecular graphs. While such techniques hold great promise, further investigations are needed to clarify if and when they indeed manage to definitively outcompete classical molecular featurisations such as extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) and physicochemical-descriptor vectors (PDVs). We systematically explore and further develop classical and graph-based molecular featurisation methods for two important tasks: molecular property prediction, in particular, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) prediction, and the largely unexplored challenge of activity-cliff (AC) prediction. We first give a technical description and critical analysis of PDVs, ECFPs and message-passing GNNs, with a focus on graph isomorphism networks (GINs). We then conduct a rigorous computational study to compare the performance of PDVs, ECFPs and GINs for QSAR and AC-prediction. Following this, we mathematically describe and computationally evaluate a novel twin neural network model for AC-prediction. We further introduce an operation called substructure pooling for the vectorisation of structural fingerprints as a natural counterpart to graph pooling in GNN architectures. We go on to propose Sort &amp; Slice, a simple substructure-pooling technique for ECFPs that robustly outperforms hash-based folding at molecular property prediction. Finally, we outline two ideas for future research: (i) a graph-based self-supervised learning strategy to make classical molecular featurisations trainable, and (ii) trainable substructure-pooling via differentiable self-attention.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Best Arm Identification in Stochastic Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of collaborative best-arm identification in stochastic linear bandits under a fixed-budget scenario. In our learning model, we consider multiple agents connected through a star network or a generic network, interacting with a linear bandit instance in parallel. The objective of the agents is to collaboratively learn the best arm of the given bandit instance with the help of a central server while minimizing the probability of error in best arm estimation. For this purpose, we devise the algorithms MaLinBAI-Star and MaLinBAI-Gen for star networks and generic networks respectively. Both algorithms employ an Upper-Confidence-Bound approach where agents share their knowledge through the central server during each communication round. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that our algorithms enjoy exponentially decaying probability of error in the allocated time budget. Furthermore, experimental results based on synthetic and real-world data validate the effectiveness of our algorithms over the existing multi-agent algorithms.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Domain-Specific Question Answering: A Case Study on Pittsburgh and CMU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to provide large language models with relevant documents for answering domain-specific questions about Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). We extracted over 1,800 subpages using a greedy scraping strategy and employed a hybrid annotation process, combining manual and Mistral-generated question-answer pairs, achieving an inter-annotator agreement (IAA) score of 0.7625. Our RAG framework integrates BM25 and FAISS retrievers, enhanced with a reranker for improved document retrieval accuracy. Experimental results show that the RAG system significantly outperforms a non-RAG baseline, particularly in time-sensitive and complex queries, with an F1 score improvement from 5.45% to 42.21% and recall of 56.18%. This study demonstrates the potential of RAG systems in enhancing answer precision and relevance, while identifying areas for further optimization in document retrieval and model training.</description>

      <title>Almost Sure Convergence Rates and Concentration of Stochastic Approximation and Reinforcement Learning with Markovian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the first almost sure convergence rate and the first maximal concentration bound with exponential tails for general contractive stochastic approximation algorithms with Markovian noise. As a corollary, we also obtain convergence rates in $L^p$. Key to our successes is a novel discretization of the mean ODE of stochastic approximation algorithms using intervals with diminishing (instead of constant) length. As applications, we provide the first almost sure convergence rate for $Q$-learning with Markovian samples without count-based learning rates. We also provide the first concentration bound for off-policy temporal difference learning with Markovian samples.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large Language Models for Climate Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing impacts of climate change, there is a growing demand for accessible tools that can provide reliable future climate information to support planning, finance, and other decision-making applications. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, present a promising approach to bridging the gap between complex climate data and the general public, offering a way for non-specialist users to obtain essential climate insights through natural language interaction. However, an essential challenge remains under-explored: evaluating the ability of LLMs to provide accurate and reliable future climate predictions, which is crucial for applications that rely on anticipating climate trends. In this study, we investigate the capability of GPT-4 in predicting rainfall at short-term (15-day) and long-term (12-month) scales. We designed a series of experiments to assess GPT's performance under different conditions, including scenarios with and without expert data inputs. Our results indicate that GPT, when operating independently, tends to generate conservative forecasts, often reverting to historical averages in the absence of clear trend signals. This study highlights both the potential and challenges of applying LLMs for future climate predictions, providing insights into their integration with climate-related applications and suggesting directions for enhancing their predictive capabilities in the field.</description>

      <title>Replicable Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of algorithmic replicability introduced by Impagliazzo et al. 2022, Ghazi et al. 2021, Ahn et al. 2024 in an online setting. In our model, the input sequence received by the online learner is generated from time-varying distributions chosen by an adversary (obliviously). Our objective is to design low-regret online algorithms that, with high probability, produce the exact same sequence of actions when run on two independently sampled input sequences generated as described above. We refer to such algorithms as adversarially replicable. Previous works (such as Esfandiari et al. 2022) explored replicability in the online setting under inputs generated independently from a fixed distribution; we term this notion as iid-replicability. Our model generalizes to capture both adversarial and iid input sequences, as well as their mixtures, which can be modeled by setting certain distributions as point-masses.
  We demonstrate adversarially replicable online learning algorithms for online linear optimization and the experts problem that achieve sub-linear regret. Additionally, we propose a general framework for converting an online learner into an adversarially replicable one within our setting, bounding the new regret in terms of the original algorithm's regret. We also present a nearly optimal (in terms of regret) iid-replicable online algorithm for the experts problem, highlighting the distinction between the iid and adversarial notions of replicability. Finally, we establish lower bounds on the regret (in terms of the replicability parameter and time) that any replicable online algorithm must incur.</description>

      <title>On Generalization Bounds for Neural Networks with Low Rank Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While previous optimization results have suggested that deep neural networks tend to favour low-rank weight matrices, the implications of this inductive bias on generalization bounds remain underexplored. In this paper, we apply Maurer's chain rule for Gaussian complexity to analyze how low-rank layers in deep networks can prevent the accumulation of rank and dimensionality factors that typically multiply across layers. This approach yields generalization bounds for rank and spectral norm constrained networks. We compare our results to prior generalization bounds for deep networks, highlighting how deep networks with low-rank layers can achieve better generalization than those with full-rank layers. Additionally, we discuss how this framework provides new perspectives on the generalization capabilities of deep networks exhibiting neural collapse.</description>

      <title>Federated Continual Learning for Edge-AI: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge-AI, the convergence of edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI), has become a promising paradigm that enables the deployment of advanced AI models at the network edge, close to users. In Edge-AI, federated continual learning (FCL) has emerged as an imperative framework, which fuses knowledge from different clients while preserving data privacy and retaining knowledge from previous tasks as it learns new ones. By so doing, FCL aims to ensure stable and reliable performance of learning models in dynamic and distributed environments. In this survey, we thoroughly review the state-of-the-art research and present the first comprehensive survey of FCL for Edge-AI. We categorize FCL methods based on three task characteristics: federated class continual learning, federated domain continual learning, and federated task continual learning. For each category, an in-depth investigation and review of the representative methods are provided, covering background, challenges, problem formalisation, solutions, and limitations. Besides, existing real-world applications empowered by FCL are reviewed, indicating the current progress and potential of FCL in diverse application domains. Furthermore, we discuss and highlight several prospective research directions of FCL such as algorithm-hardware co-design for FCL and FCL with foundation models, which could provide insights into the future development and practical deployment of FCL in the era of Edge-AI.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reason Iteratively and Parallelly for Complex Visual Reasoning Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex visual reasoning and question answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires compositional multi-step processing and higher-level reasoning capabilities beyond the immediate recognition and localization of objects and events. Here, we introduce a fully neural Iterative and Parallel Reasoning Mechanism (IPRM) that combines two distinct forms of computation -- iterative and parallel -- to better address complex VQA scenarios. Specifically, IPRM's "iterative" computation facilitates compositional step-by-step reasoning for scenarios wherein individual operations need to be computed, stored, and recalled dynamically (e.g. when computing the query "determine the color of pen to the left of the child in red t-shirt sitting at the white table"). Meanwhile, its "parallel" computation allows for the simultaneous exploration of different reasoning paths and benefits more robust and efficient execution of operations that are mutually independent (e.g. when counting individual colors for the query: "determine the maximum occurring color amongst all t-shirts"). We design IPRM as a lightweight and fully-differentiable neural module that can be conveniently applied to both transformer and non-transformer vision-language backbones. It notably outperforms prior task-specific methods and transformer-based attention modules across various image and video VQA benchmarks testing distinct complex reasoning capabilities such as compositional spatiotemporal reasoning (AGQA), situational reasoning (STAR), multi-hop reasoning generalization (CLEVR-Humans) and causal event linking (CLEVRER-Humans). Further, IPRM's internal computations can be visualized across reasoning steps, aiding interpretability and diagnosis of its errors.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Evaluating LLMs Under Task Indeterminacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) evaluations often assume there is a single correct response -- a gold label -- for each item in the evaluation corpus. However, some tasks can be ambiguous -- i.e., they provide insufficient information to identify a unique interpretation -- or vague -- i.e., they do not clearly indicate where to draw the line when making a determination. Both ambiguity and vagueness can cause task indeterminacy -- the condition where some items in the evaluation corpus have more than one correct response. In this paper, we develop a framework for evaluating LLMs under task indeterminacy. Our framework disentangles the relationships between task specification, human ratings, and LLM responses in the LLM evaluation pipeline. Using our framework, we conduct a synthetic experiment showing that evaluations that use the "gold label" assumption underestimate the true performance. We also provide a method for estimating an error-adjusted performance interval given partial knowledge about indeterminate items in the evaluation corpus. We conclude by outlining implications of our work for the research community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, the combination of AI and vehicular technology offers great potential. However, this amalgamation comes with vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. This survey focuses on the intersection of Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) and autonomous systems, with a specific focus on LiDAR-based systems. We comprehensively explore the threat landscape, encompassing cyber-attacks on sensors and adversarial perturbations. Additionally, we investigate defensive strategies employed in countering these threats. This paper endeavors to present a concise overview of the challenges and advances in securing autonomous driving systems against adversarial threats, emphasizing the need for robust defenses to ensure safety and security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern day Language Models see extensive use in text classification, yet this comes at significant computational cost. Compute-effective classification models are needed for low-resource environments, most notably on edge devices. We introduce Adaptable Embeddings Networks (AEN), a novel dual-encoder architecture using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). This architecture allows for runtime adaptation of classification criteria without retraining and is non-autoregressive. Through thorough synthetic data experimentation, we demonstrate our model outputs comparable and in certain cases superior results to that of autoregressive models an order of magnitude larger than AEN's size. The architecture's ability to preprocess and cache condition embeddings makes it ideal for edge computing applications and real-time monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>AutoMixQ: Self-Adjusting Quantization for High Performance Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under resource constraints is a significant challenge in deep learning. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), pruning, and quantization are all effective methods for improving resource efficiency. However, combining them directly often results in suboptimal performance, especially with uniform quantization across all model layers. This is due to the complex, uneven interlayer relationships introduced by pruning, necessitating more refined quantization strategies. To address this, we propose AutoMixQ, an end-to-end optimization framework that selects optimal quantization configurations for each LLM layer. AutoMixQ leverages lightweight performance models to guide the selection process, significantly reducing time and computational resources compared to exhaustive search methods. By incorporating Pareto optimality, AutoMixQ balances memory usage and performance, approaching the upper bounds of model capability under strict resource constraints. Our experiments on widely used benchmarks show that AutoMixQ reduces memory consumption while achieving superior performance. For example, at a 30\% pruning rate in LLaMA-7B, AutoMixQ achieved 66.21\% on BoolQ compared to 62.45\% for LoRA and 58.96\% for LoftQ, while reducing memory consumption by 35.5\% compared to LoRA and 27.5\% compared to LoftQ.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we discover that causal inference provides a promising approach to capture heterophilic message-passing in Graph Neural Network (GNN). By leveraging cause-effect analysis, we can discern heterophilic edges based on asymmetric node dependency. The learned causal structure offers more accurate relationships among nodes. To reduce the computational complexity, we introduce intervention-based causal inference in graph learning. We first simplify causal analysis on graphs by formulating it as a structural learning model and define the optimization problem within the Bayesian scheme. We then present an analysis of decomposing the optimization target into a consistency penalty and a structure modification based on cause-effect relations. We then estimate this target by conditional entropy and present insights into how conditional entropy quantifies the heterophily. Accordingly, we propose CausalMP, a causal message-passing discovery network for heterophilic graph learning, that iteratively learns the explicit causal structure of input graphs. We conduct extensive experiments in both heterophilic and homophilic graph settings. The result demonstrates that the our model achieves superior link prediction performance. Training on causal structure can also enhance node representation in classification task across different base models.</description>

      <title>Exact and approximate error bounds for physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of neural networks to solve differential equations, as an alternative to traditional numerical solvers, has increased recently. However, error bounds for the obtained solutions have only been developed for certain equations. In this work, we report important progress in calculating error bounds of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) solutions of nonlinear first-order ODEs. We give a general expression that describes the error of the solution that the PINN-based method provides for a nonlinear first-order ODE. In addition, we propose a technique to calculate an approximate bound for the general case and an exact bound for a particular case. The error bounds are computed using only the residual information and the equation structure. We apply the proposed methods to particular cases and show that they can successfully provide error bounds without relying on the numerical solution.</description>

      <title>Robust Detection of Watermarks for Large Language Models Under Human Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking has offered an effective approach to distinguishing text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-written text. However, the pervasive presence of human edits on LLM-generated text dilutes watermark signals, thereby significantly degrading detection performance of existing methods. In this paper, by modeling human edits through mixture model detection, we introduce a new method in the form of a truncated goodness-of-fit test for detecting watermarked text under human edits, which we refer to as Tr-GoF. We prove that the Tr-GoF test achieves optimality in robust detection of the Gumbel-max watermark in a certain asymptotic regime of substantial text modifications and vanishing watermark signals. Importantly, Tr-GoF achieves this optimality \textit{adaptively} as it does not require precise knowledge of human edit levels or probabilistic specifications of the LLMs, in contrast to the optimal but impractical (Neyman--Pearson) likelihood ratio test. Moreover, we establish that the Tr-GoF test attains the highest detection efficiency rate in a certain regime of moderate text modifications. In stark contrast, we show that sum-based detection rules, as employed by existing methods, fail to achieve optimal robustness in both regimes because the additive nature of their statistics is less resilient to edit-induced noise. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive and sometimes superior empirical performance of the Tr-GoF test on both synthetic data and open-source LLMs in the OPT and LLaMA families.</description>

      <title>Exploring applications of topological data analysis in stock index movement prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has recently gained significant attention in the field of financial prediction. However, the choice of point cloud construction methods, topological feature representations, and classification models has a substantial impact on prediction results. This paper addresses the classification problem of stock index movement. First, we construct point clouds for stock indices using three different methods. Next, we apply TDA to extract topological structures from the point clouds. Four distinct topological features are computed to represent the patterns in the data, and 15 combinations of these features are enumerated and input into six different machine learning models. We evaluate the predictive performance of various TDA configurations by conducting index movement classification tasks on datasets such as CSI, DAX, HSI and FTSE providing insights into the efficiency of different TDA setups.</description>

      <title>When Online Algorithms Influence the Environment: A Dynamical Systems Analysis of the Unintended Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effect that online algorithms have on the environment that they are learning. As a motivation, consider recommendation systems that use online algorithms to learn optimal product recommendations based on user and product attributes. It is well known that the sequence of recommendations affects user preferences. However, typical learning algorithms treat the user attributes as static and disregard the impact of their recommendations on user preferences. Our interest is to analyze the effect of this mismatch between the model assumption of a static environment, and the reality of an evolving environment affected by the recommendations. To perform this analysis, we first introduce a model for a generic coupled evolution of the parameters that are being learned, and the environment that is affected by it. We then frame a linear bandit recommendation system (RS) into this generic model where the users are characterized by a state variable that evolves based on the sequence of recommendations. The learning algorithm of the RS does not explicitly account for this evolution and assumes that the users are static. A dynamical system model that captures the coupled evolution of the population state and the learning algorithm is described, and its equilibrium behavior is analyzed. We show that when the recommendation algorithm is able to learn the population preferences in the presence of this mismatch, the algorithm induces similarity in the preferences of the user population. In particular, we present results on how different properties of the recommendation algorithm, namely the user attribute space and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, effect the population preferences when they are learned by the algorithm. We demonstrate these results using model simulations.</description>

      <title>GraCo -- A Graph Composer for Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing integrated circuits involves substantial complexity, posing challenges in revealing its potential applications - from custom digital cells to analog circuits. Despite extensive research over the past decades in building versatile and automated frameworks, there remains open room to explore more computationally efficient AI-based solutions. This paper introduces the graph composer GraCo, a novel method for synthesizing integrated circuits using reinforcement learning (RL). GraCo learns to construct a graph step-by-step, which is then converted into a netlist and simulated with SPICE. We demonstrate that GraCo is highly configurable, enabling the incorporation of prior design knowledge into the framework. We formalize how this prior knowledge can be utilized and, in particular, show that applying consistency checks enhances the efficiency of the sampling process. To evaluate its performance, we compare GraCo to a random baseline, which is known to perform well for smaller design space problems. We demonstrate that GraCo can discover circuits for tasks such as generating standard cells, including the inverter and the two-input NAND (NAND2) gate. Compared to a random baseline, GraCo requires 5x fewer sampling steps to design an inverter and successfully synthesizes a NAND2 gate that is 2.5x faster.</description>

      <title>Schemato -- An LLM for Netlist-to-Schematic Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are advancing circuit design, particularly in analog circuits. They typically generate netlists that lack human interpretability. This is a problem as human designers heavily rely on the interpretability of circuit diagrams or schematics to intuitively understand, troubleshoot, and develop designs. Hence, to integrate domain knowledge effectively, it is crucial to translate ML-generated netlists into interpretable schematics quickly and accurately. We propose Schemato, a large language model (LLM) for netlist-to-schematic conversion. In particular, we consider our approach in the two settings of converting netlists to .asc files for LTSpice and LATEX files for CircuiTikz schematics. Experiments on our circuit dataset show that Schemato achieves up to 93% compilation success rate for the netlist-to-LaTeX conversion task, surpassing the 26% rate scored by the state-of-the-art LLMs. Furthermore, our experiments show that Schemato generates schematics with a mean structural similarity index measure that is 3xhigher than the best performing LLMs, therefore closer to the reference human design.</description>

      <title>Split Federated Learning Over Heterogeneous Edge Devices: Algorithm and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a promising collaborative machine learning approach, enabling resource-constrained devices to train models without sharing raw data, while reducing computational load and preserving privacy simultaneously. However, current SL algorithms face limitations in training efficiency and suffer from prolonged latency, particularly in sequential settings, where the slowest device can bottleneck the entire process due to heterogeneous resources and frequent data exchanges between clients and servers. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Split Federated Learning (HSFL) framework, which allows resource-constrained clients to train their personalized client-side models in parallel, utilizing different cut layers. Aiming to mitigate the impact of heterogeneous environments and accelerate the training process, we formulate a latency minimization problem that optimizes computational and transmission resources jointly. Additionally, we design a resource allocation algorithm that combines the Sample Average Approximation (SAA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Lagrangian relaxation and Branch and Bound (B\&amp;B) methods to efficiently solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate that HSFL outperforms other frameworks in terms of both convergence rate and model accuracy on heterogeneous devices with non-iid data, while the optimization algorithm is better than other baseline methods in reducing latency.</description>

      <title>ICODE: Modeling Dynamical Systems with Extrinsic Input Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning models of dynamical systems with external inputs, that may be, for example, nonsmooth or piecewise, is crucial for studying complex phenomena and predicting future state evolution, which is essential for applications such as safety guarantees and decision-making. In this work, we introduce \emph{Input Concomitant Neural ODEs (ICODEs)}, which incorporate precise real-time input information into the learning process of the models, rather than treating the inputs as hidden parameters to be learned. The sufficient conditions to ensure the model's contraction property are provided to guarantee that system trajectories of the trained model converge to a fixed point, regardless of initial conditions across different training processes. We validate our method through experiments on several representative real dynamics: Single-link robot, DC-to-DC converter, motion dynamics of a rigid body, Rabinovich-Fabrikant equation, Glycolytic-glycogenolytic pathway model, and heat conduction equation. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ICODEs efficiently learn the ground truth systems, achieving superior prediction performance under both typical and atypical inputs. This work offers a valuable class of neural ODE models for understanding physical systems with explicit external input information, with potential promising applications in fields such as physics and robotics.</description>

      <title>Predictive Maintenance Study for High-Pressure Industrial Compressors: Hybrid Clustering Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a predictive maintenance strategy for high pressure industrial compressors using sensor data and features derived from unsupervised clustering integrated into classification models. The goal is to enhance model accuracy and efficiency in detecting compressor failures. After data pre processing, sensitive clustering parameters were tuned to identify algorithms that best capture the dataset's temporal and operational characteristics. Clustering algorithms were evaluated using quality metrics like Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), selecting those most effective at distinguishing between normal and non normal conditions. These features enriched regression models, improving failure detection accuracy by 4.87 percent on average. Although training time was reduced by 22.96 percent, the decrease was not statistically significant, varying across algorithms. Cross validation and key performance metrics confirmed the benefits of clustering based features in predictive maintenance models.</description>

Abstract: Forecasters using flexible neural networks (NN) in multi-horizon distributional regression setups often struggle to gain detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms that lead to the predicted feature-conditioned distribution parameters. In this work, we deploy a Neural Basis Model for Location, Scale and Shape, that blends the principled interpretability of GAMLSS with a computationally scalable shared basis decomposition, combined by linear projections supporting dedicated stepwise and parameter-wise feature shape functions aggregations. Experiments have been conducted on multiple market regions, achieving probabilistic forecasting performance comparable to that of distributional neural networks, while providing more insights into the model behavior through the learned nonlinear feature level maps to the distribution parameters across the prediction steps.</description>

      <title>Learning to Cooperate with Humans using Generative Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training agents that can coordinate zero-shot with humans is a key mission in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Current algorithms focus on training simulated human partner policies which are then used to train a Cooperator agent. The simulated human is produced either through behavior cloning over a dataset of human cooperation behavior, or by using MARL to create a population of simulated agents. However, these approaches often struggle to produce a Cooperator that can coordinate well with real humans, since the simulated humans fail to cover the diverse strategies and styles employed by people in the real world. We show \emph{learning a generative model of human partners} can effectively address this issue. Our model learns a latent variable representation of the human that can be regarded as encoding the human's unique strategy, intention, experience, or style. This generative model can be flexibly trained from any (human or neural policy) agent interaction data. By sampling from the latent space, we can use the generative model to produce different partners to train Cooperator agents. We evaluate our method -- \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}gent \textbf{M}odeling for \textbf{M}ulti-agent \textbf{A}daptation (GAMMA) -- on Overcooked, a challenging cooperative cooking game that has become a standard benchmark for zero-shot coordination. We conduct an evaluation with real human teammates, and the results show that GAMMA consistently improves performance, whether the generative model is trained on simulated populations or human datasets. Further, we propose a method for posterior sampling from the generative model that is biased towards the human data, enabling us to efficiently improve performance with only a small amount of expensive human interaction data.</description>

      <title>A Dataset for Evaluating Online Anomaly Detection Approaches for Discrete Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this position paper, we propose an approach for sustainable data collection in the field of optimal mix design for marble sludge reuse. Marble sludge, a calcium-rich residual from stone-cutting processes, can be repurposed by mixing it with various ingredients. However, determining the optimal mix design is challenging due to the variability in sludge composition and the costly, time-consuming nature of experimental data collection. Also, we investigate the possibility of using machine learning models using meta-learning as an optimization tool to estimate the correct quantity of stone-cutting sludge to be used in aggregates to obtain a mix design with specific mechanical properties that can be used successfully in the building industry. Our approach offers two key advantages: (i) through simulations, a large dataset can be generated, saving time and money during the data collection phase, and (ii) Utilizing machine learning models, with performance enhancement through hyper-parameter optimization via meta-learning, to estimate optimal mix designs reducing the need for extensive manual experimentation, lowering costs, minimizing environmental impact, and accelerating the processing of quarry sludge. Our idea promises to streamline the marble sludge reuse process by leveraging collective data and advanced machine learning, promoting sustainability and efficiency in the stonecutting sector.</description>

      <title>Generative Intervention Models for Causal Perturbation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting perturbation effects via causal models. In many applications, it is a priori unknown which mechanisms of a system are modified by an external perturbation, even though the features of the perturbation are available. For example, in genomics, some properties of a drug may be known, but not their causal effects on the regulatory pathways of cells. We propose a generative intervention model (GIM) that learns to map these perturbation features to distributions over atomic interventions in a jointly-estimated causal model. Contrary to prior approaches, this enables us to predict the distribution shifts of unseen perturbation features while gaining insights about their mechanistic effects in the underlying data-generating process. On synthetic data and scRNA-seq drug perturbation data, GIMs achieve robust out-of-distribution predictions on par with unstructured approaches, while effectively inferring the underlying perturbation mechanisms, often better than other causal inference methods.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</description>

      <title>Time-Scale Separation in Q-Learning: Extending TD($\triangle$) for Action-Value Function Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Q-Learning is a fundamental off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that has the objective of approximating action-value functions in order to learn optimal policies. Nonetheless, it has difficulties in reconciling bias with variance, particularly in the context of long-term rewards. This paper introduces Q($\Delta$)-Learning, an extension of TD($\Delta$) for the Q-Learning framework. TD($\Delta$) facilitates efficient learning over several time scales by breaking the Q($\Delta$)-function into distinct discount factors. This approach offers improved learning stability and scalability, especially for long-term tasks where discounting bias may impede convergence. Our methodology guarantees that each element of the Q($\Delta$)-function is acquired individually, facilitating expedited convergence on shorter time scales and enhancing the learning of extended time scales. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and practical evaluations on standard benchmarks like Atari that Q($\Delta$)-Learning surpasses conventional Q-Learning and TD learning methods in both tabular and deep RL environments.</description>

      <title>Teaching MLPs to Master Heterogeneous Graph-Structured Knowledge for Efficient and Accurate Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have achieved promising results in various heterogeneous graph learning tasks, owing to their superiority in capturing the intricate relationships and diverse relational semantics inherent in heterogeneous graph structures. However, the neighborhood-fetching latency incurred by structure dependency in HGNNs makes it challenging to deploy for latency-constrained applications that require fast inference. Inspired by recent GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation frameworks, we introduce HG2M and HG2M+ to combine both HGNN's superior performance and MLP's efficient inference. HG2M directly trains student MLPs with node features as input and soft labels from teacher HGNNs as targets, and HG2M+ further distills reliable and heterogeneous semantic knowledge into student MLPs through reliable node distillation and reliable meta-path distillation. Experiments conducted on six heterogeneous graph datasets show that despite lacking structural dependencies, HG2Ms can still achieve competitive or even better performance than HGNNs and significantly outperform vanilla MLPs. Moreover, HG2Ms demonstrate a 379.24$\times$ speedup in inference over HGNNs on the large-scale IGB-3M-19 dataset, showcasing their ability for latency-sensitive deployments.</description>

      <title>REFOL: Resource-Efficient Federated Online Learning for Traffic Flow Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple federated learning (FL) methods are proposed for traffic flow forecasting (TFF) to avoid heavy-transmission and privacy-leaking concerns resulting from the disclosure of raw data in centralized methods. However, these FL methods adopt offline learning which may yield subpar performance, when concept drift occurs, i.e., distributions of historical and future data vary. Online learning can detect concept drift during model training, thus more applicable to TFF. Nevertheless, the existing federated online learning method for TFF fails to efficiently solve the concept drift problem and causes tremendous computing and communication overhead. Therefore, we propose a novel method named Resource-Efficient Federated Online Learning (REFOL) for TFF, which guarantees prediction performance in a communication-lightweight and computation-efficient way. Specifically, we design a data-driven client participation mechanism to detect the occurrence of concept drift and determine clients' participation necessity. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive online optimization strategy, which guarantees prediction performance and meanwhile avoids meaningless model updates. Then, a graph convolution-based model aggregation mechanism is designed, aiming to assess participants' contribution based on spatial correlation without importing extra communication and computing consumption on clients. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of REFOL in terms of prediction improvement and resource economization.</description>

      <title>Out-Of-Distribution Detection with Diversification (Provably)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring reliable deployment of machine learning models. Recent advancements focus on utilizing easily accessible auxiliary outliers (e.g., data from the web or other datasets) in training. However, we experimentally reveal that these methods still struggle to generalize their detection capabilities to unknown OOD data, due to the limited diversity of the auxiliary outliers collected. Therefore, we thoroughly examine this problem from the generalization perspective and demonstrate that a more diverse set of auxiliary outliers is essential for enhancing the detection capabilities. However, in practice, it is difficult and costly to collect sufficiently diverse auxiliary outlier data. Therefore, we propose a simple yet practical approach with a theoretical guarantee, termed Diversity-induced Mixup for OOD detection (diverseMix), which enhances the diversity of auxiliary outlier set for training in an efficient way. Extensive experiments show that diverseMix achieves superior performance on commonly used and recent challenging large-scale benchmarks, which further confirm the importance of the diversity of auxiliary outliers.</description>

      <title>Exploration by Running Away from the Past</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to explore efficiently and effectively is a central challenge of reinforcement learning. In this work, we consider exploration through the lens of information theory. Specifically, we cast exploration as a problem of maximizing the Shannon entropy of the state occupation measure. This is done by maximizing a sequence of divergences between distributions representing an agent's past behavior and its current behavior. Intuitively, this encourages the agent to explore new behaviors that are distinct from past behaviors. Hence, we call our method RAMP, for ``$\textbf{R}$unning $\textbf{A}$way fro$\textbf{m}$ the $\textbf{P}$ast.'' A fundamental question of this method is the quantification of the distribution change over time. We consider both the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Wasserstein distance to quantify divergence between successive state occupation measures, and explain why the former might lead to undesirable exploratory behaviors in some tasks. We demonstrate that by encouraging the agent to explore by actively distancing itself from past experiences, it can effectively explore mazes and a wide range of behaviors on robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks.</description>

      <title>GNN-MultiFix: Addressing the pitfalls for GNNs for multi-label node classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning representations of graph data showing state of the art results in various tasks. Nevertheless, the superiority of these methods is usually supported by either evaluating their performance on small subset of benchmark datasets or by reasoning about their expressive power in terms of certain graph isomorphism tests. In this paper we critically analyse both these aspects through a transductive setting for the task of node classification. First, we delve deeper into the case of multi-label node classification which offers a more realistic scenario and has been ignored in most of the related works. Through analysing the training dynamics for GNN methods we highlight the failure of GNNs to learn over multi-label graph datasets even for the case of abundant training data. Second, we show that specifically for transductive node classification, even the most expressive GNN may fail to learn in absence of node attributes and without using explicit label information as input. To overcome this deficit, we propose a straightforward approach, referred to as GNN-MultiFix, that integrates the feature, label, and positional information of a node. GNN-MultiFix demonstrates significant improvement across all the multi-label datasets. We release our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Graph-MultiFix-4121.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel, computationally efficient approach for solving hard nonlinear problems of reinforcement learning (RL). Here we combine umbrella sampling, from computational physics/chemistry, with optimal control methods. The approach is realized on the basis of neural networks, with the use of policy gradient. It outperforms, by computational efficiency and implementation universality, all available state-of-the-art algorithms, in application to hard RL problems with sparse reward, state traps and lack of terminal states. The proposed approach uses an ensemble of simultaneously acting agents, with a modified reward which includes the ensemble entropy, yielding an optimal exploration-exploitation balance.</description>

      <title>GASP: Efficient Black-Box Generation of Adversarial Suffixes for Jailbreaking LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive proficiency across a range of natural language processing tasks yet remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics, which suffer from limited generalizability. While being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural jailbreak prompts that are easy to detect by safety filters or require high computational overhead due to discrete token optimization. Witnessing the limitations of existing jailbreak methods, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel framework that combines human-readable prompt generation with Latent Bayesian Optimization (LBO) to improve adversarial suffix creation in a fully black-box setting. GASP leverages LBO to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the model to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence through a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Our experiments show that GASP can generate natural jailbreak prompts, significantly improving attack success rates, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.</description>

      <title>Revised Regularization for Efficient Continual Learning through Correlation-Based Parameter Update in Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian neural network-based continual learning algorithm using Variational Inference, aiming to overcome several drawbacks of existing methods. Specifically, in continual learning scenarios, storing network parameters at each step to retain knowledge poses challenges. This is compounded by the crucial need to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, particularly given the limited access to past datasets, which complicates maintaining correspondence between network parameters and datasets across all sessions. Current methods using Variational Inference with KL divergence risk catastrophic forgetting during uncertain node updates and coupled disruptions in certain nodes. To address these challenges, we propose the following strategies. To reduce the storage of the dense layer parameters, we propose a parameter distribution learning method that significantly reduces the storage requirements. In the continual learning framework employing variational inference, our study introduces a regularization term that specifically targets the dynamics and population of the mean and variance of the parameters. This term aims to retain the benefits of KL divergence while addressing related challenges. To ensure proper correspondence between network parameters and the data, our method introduces an importance-weighted Evidence Lower Bound term to capture data and parameter correlations. This enables storage of common and distinctive parameter hyperspace bases. The proposed method partitions the parameter space into common and distinctive subspaces, with conditions for effective backward and forward knowledge transfer, elucidating the network-parameter dataset correspondence. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across diverse datasets and various combinations of sequential datasets, yielding superior performance compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) mathematically formulates decision-making with Markov Decision Process (MDP). With MDPs, researchers have achieved remarkable breakthroughs across various domains, including games, robotics, and language models. This paper seeks a new possibility, Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (NLRL), by extending traditional MDP to natural language-based representation space. Specifically, NLRL innovatively redefines RL principles, including task objectives, policy, value function, Bellman equation, and policy iteration, into their language counterparts. With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), NLRL can be practically implemented to achieve RL-like policy and value improvement by either pure prompting or gradient-based training. Experiments over Maze, Breakthrough, and Tic-Tac-Toe games demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretability of the NLRL framework among diverse use cases. Our code will be released at https://github.com/waterhorse1/Natural-language-RL.</description>

      <title>BERT-Based Approach for Automating Course Articulation Matrix Construction with Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Course Outcome (CO) and Program Outcome (PO)/Program-Specific Outcome (PSO) alignment is a crucial task for ensuring curriculum coherence and assessing educational effectiveness. The construction of a Course Articulation Matrix (CAM), which quantifies the relationship between COs and POs/PSOs, typically involves assigning numerical values (0, 1, 2, 3) to represent the degree of alignment. In this study, We experiment with four models from the BERT family: BERT Base, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa, and use multiclass classification to assess the alignment between CO and PO/PSO pairs. We first evaluate traditional machine learning classifiers, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and then apply transfer learning to evaluate the performance of the pretrained BERT models. To enhance model interpretability, we apply Explainable AI technique, specifically Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), to provide transparency into the decision-making process. Our system achieves accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values of 98.66%, 98.67%, 98.66%, and 98.66%, respectively. This work demonstrates the potential of utilizing transfer learning with BERT-based models for the automated generation of CAMs, offering high performance and interpretability in educational outcome assessment.</description>

      <title>Generating Realistic Adversarial Examples for Business Processes using Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In predictive process monitoring, predictive models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where input perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions. Unlike in computer vision, where these perturbations are designed to be imperceptible to the human eye, the generation of adversarial examples in predictive process monitoring poses unique challenges. Minor changes to the activity sequences can create improbable or even impossible scenarios to occur due to underlying constraints such as regulatory rules or process constraints. To address this, we focus on generating realistic adversarial examples tailored to the business process context, in contrast to the imperceptible, pixel-level changes commonly seen in computer vision adversarial attacks. This paper introduces two novel latent space attacks, which generate adversaries by adding noise to the latent space representation of the input data, rather than directly modifying the input attributes. These latent space methods are domain-agnostic and do not rely on process-specific knowledge, as we restrict the generation of adversarial examples to the learned class-specific data distributions by directly perturbing the latent space representation of the business process executions. We evaluate these two latent space methods with six other adversarial attacking methods on eleven real-life event logs and four predictive models. The first three attacking methods directly permute the activities of the historically observed business process executions. The fourth method constrains the adversarial examples to lie within the same data distribution as the original instances, by projecting the adversarial examples to the original data distribution.</description>

      <title>On the Sample Complexity of One Hidden Layer Networks with Equivariance, Locality and Weight Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weight sharing, equivariance, and local filters, as in convolutional neural networks, are believed to contribute to the sample efficiency of neural networks. However, it is not clear how each one of these design choices contribute to the generalization error. Through the lens of statistical learning theory, we aim to provide an insight into this question by characterizing the relative impact of each choice on the sample complexity. We obtain lower and upper sample complexity bounds for a class of single hidden layer networks. It is shown that the gain of equivariance is directly manifested in the bound, while getting a similar increase for weight sharing depends on the sharing mechanism. Among our results, we obtain a completely dimension-free bound for equivariant networks for a class of pooling operations. We show that the bound depends merely on the norm of filters, which is tighter than using the spectral norm of the respective matrix. We also characterize the trade-off in sample complexity between the parametrization of filters in spatial and frequency domains, particularly when spatial filters are localized as in vanilla convolutional neural networks.</description>

      <title>Improving Routability Prediction via NAS Using a Smooth One-shot Augmented Predictor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routability optimization in modern EDA tools has benefited greatly from using machine learning (ML) models. Constructing and optimizing the performance of ML models continues to be a challenge. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) serves as a tool to aid in the construction and improvement of these models. Traditional NAS techniques struggle to perform well on routability prediction as a result of two primary factors. First, the separation between the training objective and the search objective adds noise to the NAS process. Secondly, the increased variance of the search objective further complicates performing NAS. We craft a novel NAS technique, coined SOAP-NAS, to address these challenges through novel data augmentation techniques and a novel combination of one-shot and predictor-based NAS. Results show that our technique outperforms existing solutions by 40% closer to the ideal performance measured by ROC-AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) in DRC hotspot detection. SOAPNet is able to achieve an ROC-AUC of 0.9802 and a query time of only 0.461 ms.</description>

      <title>Layer Pruning with Consensus: A Triple-Win Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layer pruning offers a promising alternative to standard structured pruning, effectively reducing computational costs, latency, and memory footprint. While notable layer-pruning approaches aim to detect unimportant layers for removal, they often rely on single criteria that may not fully capture the complex, underlying properties of layers. We propose a novel approach that combines multiple similarity metrics into a single expressive measure of low-importance layers, called the Consensus criterion. Our technique delivers a triple-win solution: low accuracy drop, high-performance improvement, and increased robustness to adversarial attacks. With up to 78.80% FLOPs reduction and performance on par with state-of-the-art methods across different benchmarks, our approach reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 66.99% and 68.75%, respectively. Additionally, it avoids shortcut learning and improves robustness by up to 4 percentage points under various adversarial attacks. Overall, the Consensus criterion demonstrates its effectiveness in creating robust, efficient, and environmentally friendly pruned models.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Learning of Arbitrary ReLU Activation under Gaussian Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning an arbitrarily-biased ReLU activation (or neuron) over Gaussian marginals with the squared loss objective. Despite the ReLU neuron being the basic building block of modern neural networks, we still do not understand the basic algorithmic question of whether one arbitrary ReLU neuron is learnable in the non-realizable setting. In particular, all existing polynomial time algorithms only provide approximation guarantees for the better-behaved unbiased setting or restricted bias setting.
  Our main result is a polynomial time statistical query (SQ) algorithm that gives the first constant factor approximation for arbitrary bias. It outputs a ReLU activation that achieves a loss of $O(\mathrm{OPT}) + \varepsilon$ in time $\mathrm{poly}(d,1/\varepsilon)$, where $\mathrm{OPT}$ is the loss obtained by the optimal ReLU activation. Our algorithm presents an interesting departure from existing algorithms, which are all based on gradient descent and thus fall within the class of correlational statistical query (CSQ) algorithms. We complement our algorithmic result by showing that no polynomial time CSQ algorithm can achieve a constant factor approximation. Together, these results shed light on the intrinsic limitation of gradient descent, while identifying arguably the simplest setting (a single neuron) where there is a separation between SQ and CSQ algorithms.</description>

      <title>Contrasting local and global modeling with machine learning and satellite data: A case study estimating tree canopy height in African savannas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While advances in machine learning with satellite imagery (SatML) are facilitating environmental monitoring at a global scale, developing SatML models that are accurate and useful for local regions remains critical to understanding and acting on an ever-changing planet. As increasing attention and resources are being devoted to training SatML models with global data, it is important to understand when improvements in global models will make it easier to train or fine-tune models that are accurate in specific regions. To explore this question, we contrast local and global training paradigms for SatML through a case study of tree canopy height (TCH) mapping in the Karingani Game Reserve, Mozambique. We find that recent advances in global TCH mapping do not necessarily translate to better local modeling abilities in our study region. Specifically, small models trained only with locally-collected data outperform published global TCH maps, and even outperform globally pretrained models that we fine-tune using local data. Analyzing these results further, we identify specific points of conflict and synergy between local and global modeling paradigms that can inform future research toward aligning local and global performance objectives in geospatial machine learning.</description>

      <title>Model Checking for Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving: One Can Do More Than You Think!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most reinforcement learning (RL) platforms use high-level programming languages, such as OpenAI Gymnasium using Python. These frameworks provide various API and benchmarks for testing RL algorithms in different domains, such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotics. These platforms often emphasise the design of RL algorithms and the training performance but neglect the correctness of models and reward functions, which can be crucial for the successful application of RL. This paper proposes using formal methods to model AD systems and demonstrates how model checking (MC) can be used in RL for AD. Most studies combining MC and RL focus on safety, such as safety shields. However, this paper shows different facets where MC can strengthen RL. First, an MC-based model pre-analysis can reveal bugs with respect to sensor accuracy and learning step size. This step serves as a preparation of RL, which saves time if bugs exist and deepens users' understanding of the target system. Second, reward automata can benefit the design of reward functions and greatly improve learning performance especially when the learning objectives are multiple. All these findings are supported by experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Environments for Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for discrete optimization problems has increased considerably, extending RL to an area classically dominated by Operations Research (OR). Vehicle routing problems are a good example of discrete optimization problems with high practical relevance where RL techniques have had considerable success. Despite these advances, open-source development frameworks remain scarce, hampering both the testing of algorithms and the ability to objectively compare results. This ultimately slows down progress in the field and limits the exchange of ideas between the RL and OR communities.
  Here we propose a library composed of multi-agent environments that simulates classic vehicle routing problems. The library, built on PyTorch, provides a flexible modular architecture design that allows easy customization and incorporation of new routing problems. It follows the Agent Environment Cycle ("AEC") games model and has an intuitive API, enabling rapid adoption and easy integration into existing reinforcement learning frameworks.
  The library allows for a straightforward use of classical OR benchmark instances in order to narrow the gap between the test beds for algorithm benchmarking used by the RL and OR communities. Additionally, we provide benchmark instance sets for each environment, as well as baseline RL models and training code.</description>

      <title>From RNNs to Foundation Models: An Empirical Study on Commercial Building Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate short-term energy consumption forecasting for commercial buildings is crucial for smart grid operations. While smart meters and deep learning models enable forecasting using past data from multiple buildings, data heterogeneity from diverse buildings can reduce model performance. The impact of increasing dataset heterogeneity in time series forecasting, while keeping size and model constant, is understudied. We tackle this issue using the ComStock dataset, which provides synthetic energy consumption data for U.S. commercial buildings. Two curated subsets, identical in size and region but differing in building type diversity, are used to assess the performance of various time series forecasting models, including fine-tuned open-source foundation models (FMs). The results show that dataset heterogeneity and model architecture have a greater impact on post-training forecasting performance than the parameter count. Moreover, despite the higher computational cost, fine-tuned FMs demonstrate competitive performance compared to base models trained from scratch.</description>

      <title>Learning Fair Robustness via Domain Mixup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training is one of the predominant techniques for training classifiers that are robust to adversarial attacks. Recent work, however has found that adversarial training, which makes the overall classifier robust, it does not necessarily provide equal amount of robustness for all classes. In this paper, we propose the use of mixup for the problem of learning fair robust classifiers, which can provide similar robustness across all classes. Specifically, the idea is to mix inputs from the same classes and perform adversarial training on mixed up inputs. We present a theoretical analysis of this idea for the case of linear classifiers and show that mixup combined with adversarial training can provably reduce the class-wise robustness disparity. This method not only contributes to reducing the disparity in class-wise adversarial risk, but also the class-wise natural risk. Complementing our theoretical analysis, we also provide experimental results on both synthetic data and the real world dataset (CIFAR-10), which shows improvement in class wise disparities for both natural and adversarial risks.</description>

      <title>Dyson Brownian motion and random matrix dynamics of weight matrices during learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During training, weight matrices in machine learning architectures are updated using stochastic gradient descent or variations thereof. In this contribution we employ concepts of random matrix theory to analyse the resulting stochastic matrix dynamics. We first demonstrate that the dynamics can generically be described using Dyson Brownian motion, leading to e.g. eigenvalue repulsion. The level of stochasticity is shown to depend on the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, explaining the empirically observed linear scaling rule. We verify this linear scaling in the restricted Boltzmann machine. Subsequently we study weight matrix dynamics in transformers (a nano-GPT), following the evolution from a Marchenko-Pastur distribution for eigenvalues at initialisation to a combination with additional structure at the end of learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial markets are nonlinear with complexity, where different types of assets are traded between buyers and sellers, each having a view to maximize their Return on Investment (ROI). Forecasting market trends is a challenging task since various factors like stock-specific news, company profiles, public sentiments, and global economic conditions influence them. This paper describes a daily price directional predictive system of financial instruments, addressing the difficulty of predicting short-term price movements. This paper will introduce the development of a novel trading system methodology by proposing a two-layer Composing Ensembles architecture, optimized through grid search, to predict whether the price will rise or fall the next day. This strategy was back-tested on a wide range of financial instruments and time frames, demonstrating an improvement of 20% over the benchmark, representing a standard investment strategy.</description>

      <title>A Random Forest approach to detect and identify Unlawful Insider Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to The Exchange Act, 1934 unlawful insider trading is the abuse of access to privileged corporate information. While a blurred line between "routine" the "opportunistic" insider trading exists, detection of strategies that insiders mold to maneuver fair market prices to their advantage is an uphill battle for hand-engineered approaches. In the context of detailed high-dimensional financial and trade data that are structurally built by multiple covariates, in this study, we explore, implement and provide detailed comparison to the existing study (Deng et al. (2019)) and independently implement automated end-to-end state-of-art methods by integrating principal component analysis to the random forest (PCA-RF) followed by a standalone random forest (RF) with 320 and 3984 randomly selected, semi-manually labeled and normalized transactions from multiple industry. The settings successfully uncover latent structures and detect unlawful insider trading. Among the multiple scenarios, our best-performing model accurately classified 96.43 percent of transactions. Among all transactions the models find 95.47 lawful as lawful and $98.00$ unlawful as unlawful percent. Besides, the model makes very few mistakes in classifying lawful as unlawful by missing only 2.00 percent. In addition to the classification task, model generated Gini Impurity based features ranking, our analysis show ownership and governance related features based on permutation values play important roles. In summary, a simple yet powerful automated end-to-end method relieves labor-intensive activities to redirect resources to enhance rule-making and tracking the uncaptured unlawful insider trading transactions. We emphasize that developed financial and trading features are capable of uncovering fraudulent behaviors.</description>

      <title>WavChat: A Survey of Spoken Dialogue Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in spoken dialogue models, exemplified by systems like GPT-4o, have captured significant attention in the speech domain. Compared to traditional three-tier cascaded spoken dialogue models that comprise speech recognition (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS), modern spoken dialogue models exhibit greater intelligence. These advanced spoken dialogue models not only comprehend audio, music, and other speech-related features, but also capture stylistic and timbral characteristics in speech. Moreover, they generate high-quality, multi-turn speech responses with low latency, enabling real-time interaction through simultaneous listening and speaking capability. Despite the progress in spoken dialogue systems, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically organize and analyze these systems and the underlying technologies. To address this, we have first compiled existing spoken dialogue systems in the chronological order and categorized them into the cascaded and end-to-end paradigms. We then provide an in-depth overview of the core technologies in spoken dialogue models, covering aspects such as speech representation, training paradigm, streaming, duplex, and interaction capabilities. Each section discusses the limitations of these technologies and outlines considerations for future research. Additionally, we present a thorough review of relevant datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks from the perspectives of training and evaluating spoken dialogue systems. We hope this survey will contribute to advancing both academic research and industrial applications in the field of spoken dialogue systems.

      <title>COOD: Concept-based Zero-shot OOD Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can models effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in complex, multi-label settings without extensive retraining? Existing OOD detection methods struggle to capture the intricate semantic relationships and label co-occurrences inherent in multi-label settings, often requiring large amounts of training data and failing to generalize to unseen label combinations. While large language models have revolutionized zero-shot OOD detection, they primarily focus on single-label scenarios, leaving a critical gap in handling real-world tasks where samples can be associated with multiple interdependent labels. To address these challenges, we introduce COOD, a novel zero-shot multi-label OOD detection framework. COOD leverages pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing them with a concept-based label expansion strategy and a new scoring function. By enriching the semantic space with both positive and negative concepts for each label, our approach models complex label dependencies, precisely differentiating OOD samples without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving approximately 95% average AUROC on both VOC and COCO datasets, while maintaining robust performance across varying numbers of labels and different types of OOD samples.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, Cyber attacks have increased in number, and with them, the intensity of the attacks and their potential to damage the user have also increased significantly. In an ever-advancing world, users find it difficult to keep up with the latest developments in technology, which can leave them vulnerable to attacks. To avoid such situations we need tools to deter such attacks, for this machine learning models are among the best options. This paper presents a Browser Extension that uses machine learning models to enhance online security by integrating three crucial functionalities: Malicious URL detection, Spam Email detection and Network logs analysis. The proposed solution uses LGBM classifier for classification of Phishing websites, the model has been trained on a dataset with 87 features, this model achieved an accuracy of 96.5% with a precision of 96.8% and F1 score of 96.49%. The Model for Spam email detection uses Multinomial NB algorithm which has been trained on a dataset with over 5500 messages, this model achieved an accuracy of 97.09% with a precision of 100%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using machine learning models for cyber security.</description>

      <title>Deep learning waterways for rural infrastructure development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surprisingly a number of Earth's waterways remain unmapped, with a significant number in low and middle income countries. Here we build a computer vision model (WaterNet) to learn the location of waterways in the United States, based on high resolution satellite imagery and digital elevation models, and then deploy this in novel environments in the African continent. Our outputs provide detail of waterways structures hereto unmapped. When assessed against community needs requests for rural bridge building related to access to schools, health care facilities and agricultural markets, we find these newly generated waterways capture on average 93% (country range: 88-96%) of these requests whereas Open Street Map, and the state of the art data from TDX-Hydro, capture only 36% (5-72%) and 62% (37%-85%), respectively. Because these new machine learning enabled maps are built on public and operational data acquisition this approach offers promise for capturing humanitarian needs and planning for social development in places where cartographic efforts have so far failed to deliver. The improved performance in identifying community needs missed by existing data suggests significant value for rural infrastructure development and better targeting of development interventions.</description>

      <title>High resolution microprice estimates from limit orderbook data using hyperdimensional vector Tsetlin Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an error-correcting model for the microprice, a high-frequency estimator of future prices given higher order information of imbalances in the orderbook. The model takes into account a current microprice estimate given the spread and best bid to ask imbalance, and adjusts the microprice based on recent dynamics of higher price rank imbalances. We introduce a computationally fast estimator using a recently proposed hyperdimensional vector Tsetlin machine framework and demonstrate empirically that this estimator can provide a robust estimate of future prices in the orderbook.</description>

      <title>Towards Accessible Learning: Deep Learning-Based Potential Dysgraphia Detection and OCR for Potentially Dysgraphic Handwriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dysgraphia is a learning disorder that affects handwriting abilities, making it challenging for children to write legibly and consistently. Early detection and monitoring are crucial for providing timely support and interventions. This study applies deep learning techniques to address the dual tasks of dysgraphia detection and optical character recognition (OCR) on handwriting samples from children with potential dysgraphic symptoms. Using a dataset of handwritten samples from Malaysian schoolchildren, we developed a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, alongside VGG16 and ResNet50, to classify handwriting as dysgraphic or non-dysgraphic. The custom CNN model outperformed the pre-trained models, achieving a test accuracy of 91.8% with high precision, recall, and AUC, demonstrating its robustness in identifying dysgraphic handwriting features. Additionally, an OCR pipeline was created to segment and recognize individual characters in dysgraphic handwriting, achieving a character recognition accuracy of approximately 43.5%. This research highlights the potential of deep learning in supporting dysgraphia assessment, laying a foundation for tools that could assist educators and clinicians in identifying dysgraphia and tracking handwriting progress over time. The findings contribute to advancements in assistive technologies for learning disabilities, offering hope for more accessible and accurate diagnostic tools in educational and clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Preserving Expert-Level Privacy in Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem aims to learn an optimal policy from historical data collected by one or more behavioural policies (experts) by interacting with an environment. However, the individual experts may be privacy-sensitive in that the learnt policy may retain information about their precise choices. In some domains like personalized retrieval, advertising and healthcare, the expert choices are considered sensitive data. To provably protect the privacy of such experts, we propose a novel consensus-based expert-level differentially private offline RL training approach compatible with any existing offline RL algorithm. We prove rigorous differential privacy guarantees, while maintaining strong empirical performance. Unlike existing work in differentially private RL, we supplement the theory with proof-of-concept experiments on classic RL environments featuring large continuous state spaces, demonstrating substantial improvements over a natural baseline across multiple tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM based copilot assistants are useful in everyday tasks. There is a proliferation in the exploration of AI assistant use cases to support radiology workflows in a reliable manner. In this work, we present RadPhi-3, a Small Language Model instruction tuned from Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct with 3.8B parameters to assist with various tasks in radiology workflows. While impression summary generation has been the primary task which has been explored in prior works w.r.t radiology reports of Chest X-rays, we also explore other useful tasks like change summary generation comparing the current radiology report and its prior report, section extraction from radiology reports, tagging the reports with various pathologies and tubes, lines or devices present in them etc. In-addition, instruction tuning RadPhi-3 involved learning from a credible knowledge source used by radiologists, Radiopaedia.org. RadPhi-3 can be used both to give reliable answers for radiology related queries as well as perform useful tasks related to radiology reports. RadPhi-3 achieves SOTA results on the RaLEs radiology report generation benchmark.</description>

      <title>Efficient Streaming Voice Steganalysis in Challenging Detection Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing number of information hiding techniques based on network streaming media, focusing on how to covertly and efficiently embed secret information into real-time transmitted network media signals to achieve concealed communication. The misuse of these techniques can lead to significant security risks, such as the spread of malicious code, commands, and viruses. Current steganalysis methods for network voice streams face two major challenges: efficient detection under low embedding rates and short duration conditions. These challenges arise because, with low embedding rates (e.g., as low as 10%) and short transmission durations (e.g., only 0.1 second), detection models struggle to acquire sufficiently rich sample features, making effective steganalysis difficult. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Dual-View VoIP Steganalysis Framework (DVSF). The framework first randomly obfuscates parts of the native steganographic descriptors in VoIP stream segments, making the steganographic features of hard-to-detect samples more pronounced and easier to learn. It then captures fine-grained local features related to steganography, building on the global features of VoIP. Specially constructed VoIP segment triplets further adjust the feature distances within the model. Ultimately, this method effectively address the detection difficulty in VoIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of streaming voice steganalysis in these challenging detection scenarios, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods and offering superior near-real-time performance.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach to Predict the Fall [of Price] of Cryptocurrency Long Before its Actual Fall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern times, the cryptocurrency market is one of the world's most rapidly rising financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is regarded to be more volatile and illiquid than traditional markets such as equities, foreign exchange, and commodities. The risk of this market creates an uncertain condition among the investors. The purpose of this research is to predict the magnitude of the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market. Risk factor is also called volatility. Our approach will assist people who invest in the cryptocurrency market by overcoming the problems and difficulties they experience. Our approach starts with calculating the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market from the existing parameters. In twenty elements of the cryptocurrency market, the risk factor has been predicted using different machine learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. All of the models have been applied to the calculated risk factor parameter. A new model has been developed to predict better than the existing models. Our proposed model gives the highest RMSE value of 1.3229 and the lowest RMSE value of 0.0089. Following our model, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like bitcoin, Ethereum, dogecoin, etc. Where the other existing models, the highest RMSE was 14.5092, and the lower was 0.02769. So, the proposed model performs much better than models with proper generalization. Using our approach, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Outlier Synthesis for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliability of supervised classifiers is severely hampered by their limitations in dealing with unexpected inputs, leading to great interest in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Recently, OOD detectors trained on synthetic outliers, especially those generated by large diffusion models, have shown promising results in defining robust OOD decision boundaries. Building on this progress, we present NCIS, which enhances the quality of synthetic outliers by operating directly in the diffusion's model embedding space rather than combining disjoint models as in previous work and by modeling class-conditional manifolds with a conditional volume-preserving network for more expressive characterization of the training distribution. We demonstrate that these improvements yield new state-of-the-art OOD detection results on standard ImageNet100 and CIFAR100 benchmarks and provide insights into the importance of data pre-processing and other key design choices. We make our code available at \url{https://github.com/LarsDoorenbos/NCIS}.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network framework for energy mapping of hybrid monte-carlo molecular dynamics simulations of Medium Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have drawn significant interest in material design and discovery. Graph neural networks (GNNs), in particular, have demonstrated strong potential for predicting material properties. The present study proposes a graph-based representation for modeling medium-entropy alloys (MEAs). Hybrid Monte-Carlo molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations are employed to achieve thermally stable structures across various annealing temperatures in an MEA. These simulations generate dump files and potential energy labels, which are used to construct graph representations of the atomic configurations. Edges are created between each atom and its 12 nearest neighbors without incorporating explicit edge features. These graphs then serve as input for a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) based ML model to predict the system's potential energy. The GCNN architecture effectively captures the local environment and chemical ordering within the MEA structure. The GCNN-based ML model demonstrates strong performance in predicting potential energy at different steps, showing satisfactory results on both the training data and unseen configurations. Our approach presents a graph-based modeling framework for MEAs and high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which effectively captures the local chemical order (LCO) within the alloy structure. This allows us to predict key material properties influenced by LCO in both MEAs and HEAs, providing deeper insights into how atomic-scale arrangements affect the properties of these alloys.</description>

      <title>FabuLight-ASD: Unveiling Speech Activity via Body Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in multimodal environments is crucial for various applications, from video conferencing to human-robot interaction. This paper introduces FabuLight-ASD, an advanced ASD model that integrates facial, audio, and body pose information to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Our model builds upon the existing Light-ASD framework by incorporating human pose data, represented through skeleton graphs, which minimises computational overhead. Using the Wilder Active Speaker Detection (WASD) dataset, renowned for reliable face and body bounding box annotations, we demonstrate FabuLight-ASD's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Achieving an overall mean average precision (mAP) of 94.3%, FabuLight-ASD outperforms Light-ASD, which has an overall mAP of 93.7% across various challenging scenarios. The incorporation of body pose information shows a particularly advantageous impact, with notable improvements in mAP observed in scenarios with speech impairment, face occlusion, and human voice background noise. Furthermore, efficiency analysis indicates only a modest increase in parameter count (27.3%) and multiply-accumulate operations (up to 2.4%), underscoring the model's efficiency and feasibility. These findings validate the efficacy of FabuLight-ASD in enhancing ASD performance through the integration of body pose data. FabuLight-ASD's code and model weights are available at https://github.com/knowledgetechnologyuhh/FabuLight-ASD.</description>

      <title>Hymba: A Hybrid-head Architecture for Small Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Hymba, a family of small language models featuring a hybrid-head parallel architecture that integrates transformer attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs) for enhanced efficiency. Attention heads provide high-resolution recall, while SSM heads enable efficient context summarization. Additionally, we introduce learnable meta tokens that are prepended to prompts, storing critical information and alleviating the "forced-to-attend" burden associated with attention mechanisms. This model is further optimized by incorporating cross-layer key-value (KV) sharing and partial sliding window attention, resulting in a compact cache size. During development, we conducted a controlled study comparing various architectures under identical settings and observed significant advantages of our proposed architecture. Notably, Hymba achieves state-of-the-art results for small LMs: Our Hymba-1.5B-Base model surpasses all sub-2B public models in performance and even outperforms Llama-3.2-3B with 1.32% higher average accuracy, an 11.67x cache size reduction, and 3.49x throughput.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To train generalist robot policies, machine learning methods often require a substantial amount of expert human teleoperation data. An ideal robot for humans collecting data is one that closely mimics them: bimanual arms and dexterous hands. However, creating such a bimanual teleoperation system with over 50 DoF is a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Bidex, an extremely dexterous, low-cost, low-latency and portable bimanual dexterous teleoperation system which relies on motion capture gloves and teacher arms. We compare Bidex to a Vision Pro teleoperation system and a SteamVR system and find Bidex to produce better quality data for more complex tasks at a faster rate. Additionally, we show Bidex operating a mobile bimanual robot for in the wild tasks. The robot hands (5k USD) and teleoperation system (7k USD) is readily reproducible and can be used on many robot arms including two xArms (16k USD).

      <title>A Collaborative Ensemble Framework for CTR Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have established scaling laws that enable the development of larger models to achieve enhanced performance, motivating extensive research into large-scale recommendation models. However, simply increasing the model size in recommendation systems, even with large amounts of data, does not always result in the expected performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Collaborative Ensemble Training Network (CETNet), to leverage multiple distinct models, each with its own embedding table, to capture unique feature interaction patterns. Unlike naive model scaling, our approach emphasizes diversity and collaboration through collaborative learning, where models iteratively refine their predictions. To dynamically balance contributions from each model, we introduce a confidence-based fusion mechanism using general softmax, where model confidence is computed via negation entropy. This design ensures that more confident models have a greater influence on the final prediction while benefiting from the complementary strengths of other models. We validate our framework on three public datasets (AmazonElectronics, TaobaoAds, and KuaiVideo) as well as a large-scale industrial dataset from Meta, demonstrating its superior performance over individual models and state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we conduct further experiments on the Criteo and Avazu datasets to compare our method with the multi-embedding paradigm. Our results show that our framework achieves comparable or better performance with smaller embedding sizes, offering a scalable and efficient solution for CTR prediction tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs) offer transformative potential for next-generation high-performance AI but require interdisciplinary advances across devices, circuits, architecture, and design automation. The complexity of hybrid systems makes it challenging even for domain experts to understand distinct behaviors and interactions across design stack. The lack of a flexible, accurate, fast, and easy-to-use EPIC AI system simulation framework significantly limits the exploration of hardware innovations and system evaluations on common benchmarks. To address this gap, we propose SimPhony, a cross-layer modeling and simulation framework for heterogeneous electronic-photonic AI systems. SimPhony offers a platform that enables (1) generic, extensible hardware topology representation that supports heterogeneous multi-core architectures with diverse photonic tensor core designs; (2) optics-specific dataflow modeling with unique multi-dimensional parallelism and reuse beyond spatial/temporal dimensions; (3) data-aware energy modeling with realistic device responses, layout-aware area estimation, link budget analysis, and bandwidth-adaptive memory modeling; and (4) seamless integration with model training framework for hardware/software co-simulation. By providing a unified, versatile, and high-fidelity simulation platform, SimPhony enables researchers to innovate and evaluate EPIC AI hardware across multiple domains, facilitating the next leap in emerging AI hardware.

      <title>Delta-Influence: Unlearning Poisons via Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing data integrity challenges, such as unlearning the effects of data poisoning after model training, is necessary for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. State-of-the-art influence functions, such as EK-FAC, often fail to accurately attribute abnormal model behavior to the specific poisoned training data responsible for the data poisoning attack. In addition, traditional unlearning algorithms often struggle to effectively remove the influence of poisoned samples, particularly when only a few affected examples can be identified. To address these challenge, we introduce $\Delta$-Influence, a novel approach that leverages influence functions to trace abnormal model behavior back to the responsible poisoned training data using as little as just one poisoned test example. $\Delta$-Influence applies data transformations that sever the link between poisoned training data and compromised test points without significantly affecting clean data. This allows $\Delta$-Influence to detect large negative shifts in influence scores following data transformations, a phenomenon we term as influence collapse, thereby accurately identifying poisoned training data. Unlearning this subset, e.g. through retraining, effectively eliminates the data poisoning. We validate our method across three vision-based poisoning attacks and three datasets, benchmarking against four detection algorithms and five unlearning strategies. We show that $\Delta$-Influence consistently achieves the best unlearning across all settings, showing the promise of influence functions for corrective unlearning.

      <title>Assessing Gender Bias in LLMs: Comparing LLM Outputs with Human Perceptions and Official Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates gender bias in large language models (LLMs) by comparing their gender perception to that of human respondents, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, and a 50% no-bias benchmark. We created a new evaluation set using occupational data and role-specific sentences. Unlike common benchmarks included in LLM training data, our set is newly developed, preventing data leakage and test set contamination. Five LLMs were tested to predict the gender for each role using single-word answers. We used Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to compare model outputs with human perceptions, statistical data, and the 50% neutrality benchmark. All LLMs showed significant deviation from gender neutrality and aligned more with statistical data, still reflecting inherent biases.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking a wide range of optimisers for solving the Fermi-Hubbard model using the variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically benchmark 30 optimisers on 372 instances of the variational quantum eigensolver for solving the Fermi-Hubbard system with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz. We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>AttentionBreaker: Adaptive Evolutionary Optimization for Unmasking Vulnerabilities in LLMs through Bit-Flip Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.</description>

      <title>NewsInterview: a Dataset and a Playground to Evaluate LLMs' Ground Gap via Informational Interviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent text but often struggle with grounding language and strategic dialogue. To address this gap, we focus on journalistic interviews, a domain rich in grounding communication and abundant in data. We curate a dataset of 40,000 two-person informational interviews from NPR and CNN, and reveal that LLMs are significantly less likely than human interviewers to use acknowledgements and to pivot to higher-level questions. Realizing that a fundamental deficit exists in multi-turn planning and strategic thinking, we develop a realistic simulated environment, incorporating source personas and persuasive elements, in order to facilitate the development of agents with longer-horizon rewards. Our experiments show that while source LLMs mimic human behavior in information sharing, interviewer LLMs struggle with recognizing when questions are answered and engaging persuasively, leading to suboptimal information extraction across model size and capability. These findings underscore the need for enhancing LLMs' strategic dialogue capabilities.</description>

      <title>Edge-Cloud Routing for Text-to-Image Model with Token-Level Multi-Metric Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large text-to-image models demonstrate impressive generation capabilities; however, their substantial size necessitates expensive cloud servers for deployment. Conversely, light-weight models can be deployed on edge devices at lower cost but often with inferior generation quality for complex user prompts. To strike a balance between performance and cost, we propose a routing framework, called \texttt{RouteT2I}, which dynamically selects either the large cloud model or the light-weight edge model for each user prompt. Since generated image quality is challenging to measure directly, \texttt{RouteT2I} establishes multi-dimensional quality metrics, particularly, by evaluating the similarity between the generated images and both positive and negative texts that describe each specific quality metric. \texttt{RouteT2I} then predicts the expected quality of the generated images by identifying key tokens in the prompt and comparing their impact on the quality. \texttt{RouteT2I} further introduces the Pareto relative superiority to compare the multi-metric quality of the generated images. Based on this comparison and predefined cost constraints, \texttt{RouteT2I} allocates prompts to either the edge or the cloud. Evaluation reveals that \texttt{RouteT2I} significantly reduces the number of requesting large cloud model while maintaining high-quality image generation.</description>

      <title>FLRNet: A Deep Learning Method for Regressive Reconstruction of Flow Field From Limited Sensor Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many applications in computational and experimental fluid mechanics require effective methods for reconstructing the flow fields from limited sensor data. However, this task remains a significant challenge because the measurement operator, which provides the punctual sensor measurement for a given state of the flow field, is often ill-conditioned and non-invertible. This issue impedes the feasibility of identifying the forward map, theoretically the inverse of the measurement operator, for field reconstruction purposes. While data-driven methods are available, their generalizability across different flow conditions (\textit{e.g.,} different Reynold numbers) remains questioned. Moreover, they frequently face the problem of spectral bias, which leads to smooth and blurry reconstructed fields, thereby decreasing the accuracy of reconstruction. We introduce FLRNet, a deep learning method for flow field reconstruction from sparse sensor measurements. FLRNet employs an variational autoencoder with Fourier feature layers and incorporates an extra perceptual loss term during training to learn a rich, low-dimensional latent representation of the flow field. The learned latent representation is then correlated to the sensor measurement using a fully connected (dense) network. We validated the reconstruction capability and the generalizability of FLRNet under various fluid flow conditions and sensor configurations, including different sensor counts and sensor layouts. Numerical experiments show that in all tested scenarios, FLRNet consistently outperformed other baselines, delivering the most accurate reconstructed flow field and being the most robust to noise.</description>

      <title>Interactive and Expressive Code-Augmented Planning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong abilities in common-sense reasoning and interactive decision-making, but often struggle with complex, long-horizon planning tasks. Recent techniques have sought to structure LLM outputs using control flow and other code-adjacent techniques to improve planning performance. These techniques include using variables (to track important information) and functions (to divide complex tasks into smaller re-usable sub-tasks). However, purely code-based approaches can be error-prone and insufficient for handling ambiguous or unstructured data. To address these challenges, we propose REPL-Plan, an LLM planning approach that is fully code-expressive (it can utilize all the benefits of code) while also being dynamic (it can flexibly adapt from errors and use the LLM for fuzzy situations). In REPL-Plan, an LLM solves tasks by interacting with a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), which iteratively executes and evaluates code, similar to language shells or interactive code notebooks, allowing the model to flexibly correct errors and handle tasks dynamically. We demonstrate that REPL-Plan achieves strong results across various planning domains compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Dealing with Synthetic Data Contamination in Online Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image generation has shown remarkable results in generating high-fidelity realistic images, in particular with the advancement of diffusion-based models. However, the prevalence of AI-generated images may have side effects for the machine learning community that are not clearly identified. Meanwhile, the success of deep learning in computer vision is driven by the massive dataset collected on the Internet. The extensive quantity of synthetic data being added to the Internet would become an obstacle for future researchers to collect "clean" datasets without AI-generated content. Prior research has shown that using datasets contaminated by synthetic images may result in performance degradation when used for training. In this paper, we investigate the potential impact of contaminated datasets on Online Continual Learning (CL) research. We experimentally show that contaminated datasets might hinder the training of existing online CL methods. Also, we propose Entropy Selection with Real-synthetic similarity Maximization (ESRM), a method to alleviate the performance deterioration caused by synthetic images when training online CL models. Experiments show that our method can significantly alleviate performance deterioration, especially when the contamination is severe. For reproducibility, the source code of our work is available at https://github.com/maorong-wang/ESRM.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Approach to The Detection and Classification of Skin Diseases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to PBS, nearly one-third of Americans lack access to primary care services, and another forty percent delay going to avoid medical costs. As a result, many diseases are left undiagnosed and untreated, even if the disease shows many physical symptoms on the skin. With the rise of AI, self-diagnosis and improved disease recognition have become more promising than ever; in spite of that, existing methods suffer from a lack of large-scale patient databases and outdated methods of study, resulting in studies being limited to only a few diseases or modalities. This study incorporates readily available and easily accessible patient information via image and text for skin disease classification on a new dataset of 26 skin disease types that includes both skin disease images (37K) and associated patient narratives. Using this dataset, baselines for various image models were established that outperform existing methods. Initially, the Resnet-50 model was only able to achieve an accuracy of 70% but, after various optimization techniques, the accuracy was improved to 80%. In addition, this study proposes a novel fine-tuning strategy for sequence classification Large Language Models (LLMs), Chain of Options, which breaks down a complex reasoning task into intermediate steps at training time instead of inference. With Chain of Options and preliminary disease recommendations from the image model, this method achieves state of the art accuracy 91% in diagnosing patient skin disease given just an image of the afflicted area as well as a patient description of the symptoms (such as itchiness or dizziness). Through this research, an earlier diagnosis of skin diseases can occur, and clinicians can work with deep learning models to give a more accurate diagnosis, improving quality of life and saving lives.</description>

      <title>HARec: Hyperbolic Graph-LLM Alignment for Exploration and Exploitation in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recommendation systems often create information cocoons, limiting users' exposure to diverse content. To enhance user experience, a crucial challenge is developing systems that can balance content exploration and exploitation, allowing users to adjust their recommendation preferences. Intuitively, this balance can be achieved through a tree-structured representation, where depth search facilitates exploitation and breadth search enables exploration. However, current works face two challenges to achieve this target: (1) Euclidean methods fail to fully capture hierarchical structures and lack flexibility in balancing exploration-exploitation, while (2) hyperbolic approaches, despite better hierarchical modeling, suffer from insufficient semantic alignment due to their reliance on Euclidean text encoders. To address these challenges, we propose HARec, a hyperbolic representation learning framework that jointly aligns user-item collaborative information with textual descriptions in hyperbolic space. Our framework introduces two key technique novelty: (1) a hierarchical-aware graph-llm alignment mechanism that enables better hierarchical representation, and (2) a hyperbolic hierarchical tree structure that facilitates user-adjustable exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HARec consistently outperforms both Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines, achieving up to 5.49% improvement in utility metrics and 11.39% increase in diversity metrics.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of periodic lattice structures for specified mechanical properties using machine learning considering member connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a methodology to utilize machine learning (ML) for topology optimization of periodic lattice structures. In particular, we investigate data representation of lattice structures used as input data for ML models to improve the performance of the models, focusing on the filtering process and feature selection. We use the filtering technique to explicitly consider the connectivity of lattice members and perform feature selection to reduce the input data size. In addition, we propose a convolution approach to apply pre-trained models for small structures to structures of larger sizes. The computational cost for obtaining optimal topologies by a heuristic method is reduced by incorporating the prediction of the trained ML model into the optimization process. In the numerical examples, a response prediction model is constructed for a lattice structure of 4x4 units, and topology optimization of 4x4-unit and 8x8-unit structures is performed by simulated annealing assisted by the trained ML model. The example demonstrates that ML models perform higher accuracy by using the filtered data as input than by solely using the data representing the existence of each member. It is also demonstrated that a small-scale prediction model can be constructed with sufficient accuracy by feature selection. Additionally, the proposed method can find the optimal structure in less computation time than the pure simulated annealing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The urgent need to promptly detect cardiac disorders from 12-lead Electrocardiograms using limited computations is motivated by the heart's fast and complex electrical activity and restricted computational power of portable devices. Timely and precise diagnoses are crucial since delays might significantly impact patient health outcomes. This research presents a novel deep-learning architecture that aims to diagnose heart abnormalities quickly and accurately. We devised a new activation function called aSoftMax, designed to improve the visibility of ECG deflections. The proposed activation function is used with Convolutional Neural Network architecture to includes kernel weight sharing across the ECG's various leads. This innovative method thoroughly generalizes the global 12-lead ECG features and minimizes the model's complexity by decreasing the trainable parameters. aSoftMax, combined with enhanced CNN architecture yielded AmpliNetECG12, we obtain exceptional accuracy of 84% in diagnosing cardiac disorders. AmpliNetECG12 shows outstanding prediction ability when used with the CPSC2018 dataset for arrhythmia classification. The model attains an F1-score of 80.71% and a ROC-AUC score of 96.00%, with 280,000 trainable parameters which signifies the lightweight yet efficient nature of AmpliNetECG12. The stochastic characteristics of aSoftMax, a fundamental element of AmpliNetECG12, improve prediction accuracy and also increasse the model's interpretability. This feature enhances comprehension of important ECG segments in different forms of arrhythmias, establishing a new standard of explainable architecture for cardiac disorder classification.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Clustering of Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data streams generated from unknown distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data streams belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I &lt; d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I &lt; d_L$ in general. Our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than $k$-medoids distribution clustering. We also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.</description>

Abstract: The real-world application of small drones is mostly hampered by energy limitations. Neuromorphic computing promises extremely energy-efficient AI for autonomous flight, but is still challenging to train and deploy on real robots. In order to reap the maximal benefits from neuromorphic computing, it is desired to perform all autonomy functions end-to-end on a single neuromorphic chip, from low-level attitude control to high-level navigation. This research presents the first neuromorphic control system using a spiking neural network (SNN) to effectively map a drone's raw sensory input directly to motor commands. We apply this method to low-level attitude estimation and control for a quadrotor, deploying the SNN on a tiny Crazyflie. We propose a modular SNN, separately training and then merging estimation and control sub-networks. The SNN is trained with imitation learning, using a flight dataset of sensory-motor pairs. Post-training, the network is deployed on the Crazyflie, issuing control commands from sensor inputs at $500$Hz. Furthermore, for the training procedure we augmented training data by flying a controller with additional excitation and time-shifting the target data to enhance the predictive capabilities of the SNN. On the real drone the perception-to-control SNN tracks attitude commands with an average error of $3$ degrees, compared to $2.5$ degrees for the regular flight stack. We also show the benefits of the proposed learning modifications for reducing the average tracking error and reducing oscillations. Our work shows the feasibility of performing neuromorphic end-to-end control, laying the basis for highly energy-efficient and low-latency neuromorphic autopilots.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Equipped UAV for Data Collection in Backscatter Sensor Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backscatter communication (BC) becomes a promising energy-efficient solution for future wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable flexible data collection from remote backscatter devices (BDs), yet conventional UAVs rely on omni-directional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), limiting channel gain and prolonging data collection time. To address this issue, we consider equipping a UAV with a directional movable antenna (MA) with high directivity and flexibility. The MA enhances channel gain by precisely aiming its main lobe at each BD, focusing transmission power for efficient communication. Our goal is to minimize the total data collection time by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and the MA's orientation. We develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy using the azimuth angle and distance between the UAV and each BD to simplify the agent's observation space. To ensure stability during training, we adopt Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm that balances exploration with reward maximization for efficient and reliable learning. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed MA-equipped UAV with SAC outperforms both FPA-equipped UAVs and other RL methods, achieving significant reductions in both data collection time and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Market Making without Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a sequential decision-making setting where, at every round $t$, a market maker posts a bid price $B_t$ and an ask price $A_t$ to an incoming trader (the taker) with a private valuation for one unit of some asset. If the trader's valuation is lower than the bid price, or higher than the ask price, then a trade (sell or buy) occurs. If a trade happens at round $t$, then letting $M_t$ be the market price (observed only at the end of round $t$), the maker's utility is $M_t - B_t$ if the maker bought the asset, and $A_t - M_t$ if they sold it. We characterize the maker's regret with respect to the best fixed choice of bid and ask pairs under a variety of assumptions (adversarial, i.i.d., and their variants) on the sequence of market prices and valuations. Our upper bound analysis unveils an intriguing connection relating market making to first-price auctions and dynamic pricing. Our main technical contribution is a lower bound for the i.i.d. case with Lipschitz distributions and independence between prices and valuations. The difficulty in the analysis stems from the unique structure of the reward and feedback functions, allowing an algorithm to acquire information by graduating the "cost of exploration" in an arbitrary way.</description>

      <title>Accelerated zero-order SGD under high-order smoothness and overparameterized regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel gradient-free algorithm to solve a convex stochastic optimization problem, such as those encountered in medicine, physics, and machine learning (e.g., adversarial multi-armed bandit problem), where the objective function can only be computed through numerical simulation, either as the result of a real experiment or as feedback given by the function evaluations from an adversary. Thus we suppose that only a black-box access to the function values of the objective is available, possibly corrupted by adversarial noise: deterministic or stochastic. The noisy setup can arise naturally from modeling randomness within a simulation or by computer discretization, or when exact values of function are forbidden due to privacy issues, or when solving non-convex problems as convex ones with an inexact function oracle. By exploiting higher-order smoothness, fulfilled, e.g., in logistic regression, we improve the performance of zero-order methods developed under the assumption of classical smoothness (or having a Lipschitz gradient). The proposed algorithm enjoys optimal oracle complexity and is designed under an overparameterization setup, i.e., when the number of model parameters is much larger than the size of the training dataset. Overparametrized models fit to the training data perfectly while also having good generalization and outperforming underparameterized models on unseen data. We provide convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithm under both types of noise. Moreover, we estimate the maximum permissible adversarial noise level that maintains the desired accuracy in the Euclidean setup, and then we extend our results to a non-Euclidean setup. Our theoretical results are verified on the logistic regression problem.</description>

      <title>Single-Model Attribution for Spoofed Speech via Vocoder Fingerprints in an Open-World Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As speech generation technology advances, so do the potential threats of misusing spoofed speech signals. One way to address these threats is by attributing the signals to their source generative model. In this work, we are the first to tackle the single-model attribution task in an open-world setting, that is, we aim at identifying whether spoofed speech signals from unknown sources originate from a specific vocoder. We show that the standardized average residual between audio signals and their low-pass filtered or EnCodec filtered versions can serve as powerful vocoder fingerprints. The approach only requires data from the target vocoder and allows for simple but highly accurate distance-based model attribution. We demonstrate its effectiveness on LJSpeech and JSUT, achieving an average AUROC of over 99% in most settings. The accompanying robustness study shows that it is also resilient to noise levels up to a certain degree.</description>

      <title>Automatic brain tumor segmentation in 2D intra-operative ultrasound images using MRI tumor annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic segmentation of brain tumors in intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) images could facilitate localization of tumor tissue during resection surgery. The lack of large annotated datasets limits the current models performances. In this paper, we investigate the use of tumor annotations in pre-operative MRI images, which are more easily accessible than annotations in iUS images, for training of deep learning models for iUS brain tumor segmentation. We used 180 annotated pre-operative MRI images with corresponding unannotated iUS images, and 29 annotated iUS images. Image registration was performed to transfer the MRI annotations to the corresponding iUS images before training models with the nnU-Net framework. To validate the use of MRI labels, the models were compared to a model trained with only US annotated tumors, and a model with both US and MRI annotated tumors. In addition, the results were compared to annotations validated by an expert neurosurgeon on the same test set to measure inter-observer variability. The results showed similar performance for a model trained with only MRI annotated tumors, compared to a model trained with only US annotated tumors. The model trained using both modalities obtained slightly better results with an average Dice score of 0.62, where external expert annotations achieved a score of 0.67. The results also showed that the deep learning models were comparable to expert annotation for larger tumors (&gt; 200 mm2), but perform clearly worse for smaller tumors (&lt; 200 mm2). This shows that MRI tumor annotations can be used as a substitute for US tumor annotations to train a deep learning model for automatic brain tumor segmentation in intra-operative ultrasound images. Small tumors is a limitation for the current models and will be the focus of future work. The main models are available here: https://github.com/mathildefaanes/us_brain_tumor_segmentation.</description>

      <title>MMGenBench: Evaluating the Limits of LMMs from the Text-to-Image Generation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. While existing benchmarks for evaluating LMMs mainly focus on image comprehension, few works evaluate them from the image generation perspective. To address this issue, we propose a straightforward automated evaluation pipeline. Specifically, this pipeline requires LMMs to generate an image-prompt from a given input image. Subsequently, it employs text-to-image generative models to create a new image based on these generated prompts. Finally, we evaluate the performance of LMMs by comparing the original image with the generated one. Furthermore, we introduce MMGenBench-Test, a comprehensive benchmark developed to evaluate LMMs across 13 distinct image patterns, and MMGenBench-Domain, targeting the performance evaluation of LMMs within the generative image domain. A thorough evaluation involving over 50 popular LMMs demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability in both the pipeline and benchmark. Our observations indicate that numerous LMMs excelling in existing benchmarks fail to adequately complete the basic tasks, related to image understanding and description. This finding highlights the substantial potential for performance improvement in current LMMs and suggests avenues for future model optimization. Concurrently, our pipeline facilitates the efficient assessment of LMMs performance across diverse domains by using solely image inputs.</description>

      <title>MetaCropFollow: Few-Shot Adaptation with Meta-Learning for Under-Canopy Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous under-canopy navigation faces additional challenges compared to over-canopy settings - for example the tight spacing between the crop rows, degraded GPS accuracy and excessive clutter. Keypoint-based visual navigation has been shown to perform well in these conditions, however the differences between agricultural environments in terms of lighting, season, soil and crop type mean that a domain shift will likely be encountered at some point of the robot deployment. In this paper, we explore the use of Meta-Learning to overcome this domain shift using a minimal amount of data. We train a base-learner that can quickly adapt to new conditions, enabling more robust navigation in low-data regimes.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based online learning of two-layer quasi-geostrophic baroclinic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For reasons of computational constraint, most global ocean circulation models used for Earth System Modeling still rely on parameterizations of sub-grid processes, and limitations in these parameterizations affect the modeled ocean circulation and impact on predictive skill. An increasingly popular approach is to leverage machine learning approaches for parameterizations, regressing for a map between the resolved state and missing feedbacks in a fluid system as a supervised learning task. However, the learning is often performed in an `offline' fashion, without involving the underlying fluid dynamical model during the training stage. Here, we explore the `online' approach that involves the fluid dynamical model during the training stage for the learning of baroclinic turbulence and its parameterization, with reference to ocean eddy parameterization. Two online approaches are considered: a full adjoint-based online approach, related to traditional adjoint optimization approaches that require a `differentiable' dynamical model, and an approximately online approach that approximates the adjoint calculation and does not require a differentiable dynamical model. The online approaches are found to be generally more skillful and numerically stable than offline approaches. Others details relating to online training, such as window size, machine learning model set up and designs of the loss functions are detailed to aid in further explorations of the online training methodology for Earth System Modeling.</description>

Abstract: The increased reliance of self-driving vehicles on neural networks opens up the challenge of their verification.  In this paper we present an experience report, describing a case study which we undertook to explore the design and training of a neural network on a custom dataset for vision-based autonomous navigation. We are particularly interested in the use of machine learning with differentiable logics to obtain networks satisfying basic safety properties by design, guaranteeing the behaviour of the neural network after training. We motivate the choice of a suitable neural network verifier for our purposes and report our observations on the use of neural network verifiers for self-driving systems.</description>

      <title>SPARKLE: A Unified Single-Loop Primal-Dual Framework for Decentralized Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies decentralized bilevel optimization, in which multiple agents collaborate to solve problems involving nested optimization structures with neighborhood communications. Most existing literature primarily utilizes gradient tracking to mitigate the influence of data heterogeneity, without exploring other well-known heterogeneity-correction techniques such as EXTRA or Exact Diffusion. Additionally, these studies often employ identical decentralized strategies for both upper- and lower-level problems, neglecting to leverage distinct mechanisms across different levels. To address these limitations, this paper proposes SPARKLE, a unified Single-loop Primal-dual AlgoRithm frameworK for decentraLized bilEvel optimization. SPARKLE offers the flexibility to incorporate various heterogeneitycorrection strategies into the algorithm. Moreover, SPARKLE allows for different strategies to solve upper- and lower-level problems. We present a unified convergence analysis for SPARKLE, applicable to all its variants, with state-of-the-art convergence rates compared to existing decentralized bilevel algorithms. Our results further reveal that EXTRA and Exact Diffusion are more suitable for decentralized bilevel optimization, and using mixed strategies in bilevel algorithms brings more benefits than relying solely on gradient tracking.</description>

      <title>Learning Pore-scale Multi-phase Flow from Experimental Data with Graph Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the process of multiphase fluid flow through porous media is crucial for many climate change mitigation technologies, including CO$_2$ geological storage, hydrogen storage, and fuel cells. However, current numerical models are often incapable of accurately capturing the complex pore-scale physics observed in experiments. In this study, we address this challenge using a graph neural network-based approach and directly learn pore-scale fluid flow using micro-CT experimental data. We propose a Long-Short-Edge MeshGraphNet (LSE-MGN) that predicts the state of each node in the pore space at each time step. During inference, given an initial state, the model can autoregressively predict the evolution of the multiphase flow process over time. This approach successfully captures the physics from the high-resolution experimental data while maintaining computational efficiency, providing a promising direction for accurate and efficient pore-scale modeling of complex multiphase fluid flow dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Automatic image generation is no longer just of interest to researchers, but also to practitioners. However, current models are sensitive to the settings used and automatic optimization methods often require human involvement. To bridge this gap, we introduce ComfyGI, a novel approach to automatically improve workflows for image generation without the need for human intervention driven by techniques from genetic improvement. This enables image generation with significantly higher quality in terms of the alignment with the given description and the perceived aesthetics. On the performance side, we find that overall, the images generated with an optimized workflow are about 50% better compared to the initial workflow in terms of the median ImageReward score. These already good results are even surpassed in our human evaluation, as the participants preferred the images improved by ComfyGI in around 90% of the cases.</description>

      <title>OpenScholar: Synthesizing Scientific Literature with Retrieval-augmented LMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific progress depends on researchers' ability to synthesize the growing body of literature. Can large language models (LMs) assist scientists in this task? We introduce OpenScholar, a specialized retrieval-augmented LM that answers scientific queries by identifying relevant passages from 45 million open-access papers and synthesizing citation-backed responses. To evaluate OpenScholar, we develop ScholarQABench, the first large-scale multi-domain benchmark for literature search, comprising 2,967 expert-written queries and 208 long-form answers across computer science, physics, neuroscience, and biomedicine. On ScholarQABench, OpenScholar-8B outperforms GPT-4o by 5% and PaperQA2 by 7% in correctness, despite being a smaller, open model. While GPT4o hallucinates citations 78 to 90% of the time, OpenScholar achieves citation accuracy on par with human experts. OpenScholar's datastore, retriever, and self-feedback inference loop also improves off-the-shelf LMs: for instance, OpenScholar-GPT4o improves GPT-4o's correctness by 12%. In human evaluations, experts preferred OpenScholar-8B and OpenScholar-GPT4o responses over expert-written ones 51% and 70% of the time, respectively, compared to GPT4o's 32%. We open-source all of our code, models, datastore, data and a public demo.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Robustness of Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have performed well on several reasoning benchmarks, including ones that test analogical reasoning abilities. However, there is debate on the extent to which they are performing general abstract reasoning versus employing non-robust processes, e.g., that overly rely on similarity to pre-training data. Here we investigate the robustness of analogy-making abilities previously claimed for LLMs on three of four domains studied by Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023): letter-string analogies, digit matrices, and story analogies. For each domain we test humans and GPT models on robustness to variants of the original analogy problems that test the same abstract reasoning abilities but are likely dissimilar from tasks in the pre-training data. The performance of a system that uses robust abstract reasoning should not decline substantially on these variants.
  On simple letter-string analogies, we find that while the performance of humans remains high for two types of variants we tested, the GPT models' performance declines sharply. This pattern is less pronounced as the complexity of these problems is increased, as both humans and GPT models perform poorly on both the original and variant problems requiring more complex analogies. On digit-matrix problems, we find a similar pattern but only on one out of the two types of variants we tested. On story-based analogy problems, we find that, unlike humans, the performance of GPT models are susceptible to answer-order effects, and that GPT models also may be more sensitive than humans to paraphrasing.
  This work provides evidence that LLMs often lack the robustness of zero-shot human analogy-making, exhibiting brittleness on most of the variations we tested. More generally, this work points to the importance of carefully evaluating AI systems not only for accuracy but also robustness when testing their cognitive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Aided Policy Tuning for Black-Box Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can robots learn and adapt to new tasks and situations with little data? Systematic exploration and simulation are crucial tools for efficient robot learning. We present a novel black-box policy search algorithm focused on data-efficient policy improvements. The algorithm learns directly on the robot and treats simulation as an additional information source to speed up the learning process. At the core of the algorithm, a probabilistic model learns the dependence of the policy parameters and the robot learning objective not only by performing experiments on the robot, but also by leveraging data from a simulator. This substantially reduces interaction time with the robot. Using this model, we can guarantee improvements with high probability for each policy update, thereby facilitating fast, goal-oriented learning. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated fine-tuning tasks and demonstrate the data-efficiency of the proposed dual-information source optimization algorithm. In a real robot learning experiment, we show fast and successful task learning on a robot manipulator with the aid of an imperfect simulator.</description>

      <title>Do I Know This Entity? Knowledge Awareness and Hallucinations in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models are a widespread problem, yet the mechanisms behind whether models will hallucinate are poorly understood, limiting our ability to solve this problem. Using sparse autoencoders as an interpretability tool, we discover that a key part of these mechanisms is entity recognition, where the model detects if an entity is one it can recall facts about. Sparse autoencoders uncover meaningful directions in the representation space, these detect whether the model recognizes an entity, e.g. detecting it doesn't know about an athlete or a movie. This suggests that models can have self-knowledge: internal representations about their own capabilities. These directions are causally relevant: capable of steering the model to refuse to answer questions about known entities, or to hallucinate attributes of unknown entities when it would otherwise refuse. We demonstrate that despite the sparse autoencoders being trained on the base model, these directions have a causal effect on the chat model's refusal behavior, suggesting that chat finetuning has repurposed this existing mechanism. Furthermore, we provide an initial exploration into the mechanistic role of these directions in the model, finding that they disrupt the attention of downstream heads that typically move entity attributes to the final token.</description>

      <title>Outlier-robust Mean Estimation near the Breakdown Point via Sum-of-Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of estimating the mean of a high-dimensional distribution in the presence of an $\varepsilon$-fraction of adversarial outliers.
  When $\varepsilon$ is at most some sufficiently small constant, previous works can achieve optimal error rate efficiently \cite{diakonikolas2018robustly, kothari2018robust}. As $\varepsilon$ approaches the breakdown point $\frac{1}{2}$, all previous algorithms incur either sub-optimal error rates or exponential running time.
  In this paper we give a new analysis of the canonical sum-of-squares program introduced in \cite{kothari2018robust} and show that this program efficiently achieves optimal error rate for all $\varepsilon \in[0,\frac{1}{2})$. The key ingredient for our results is a new identifiability proof for robust mean estimation that focuses on the overlap between the distributions instead of their statistical distance as in previous works. We capture this proof within the sum-of-squares proof system, thus obtaining efficient algorithms using the sum-of-squares proofs to algorithms paradigm \cite{raghavendra2018high}.</description>

      <title>Model-free learning of probability flows: Elucidating the nonequilibrium dynamics of flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active systems comprise a class of nonequilibrium dynamics in which individual components autonomously dissipate energy. Efforts towards understanding the role played by activity have centered on computation of the entropy production rate (EPR), which quantifies the breakdown of time reversal symmetry. A fundamental difficulty in this program is that high dimensionality of the phase space renders traditional computational techniques infeasible for estimating the EPR. Here, we overcome this challenge with a novel deep learning approach that estimates probability currents directly from stochastic system trajectories. We derive a new physical connection between the probability current and two local definitions of the EPR for inertial systems, which we apply to characterize the departure from equilibrium in a canonical model of flocking. Our results highlight that entropy is produced and consumed on the spatial interface of a flock as the interplay between alignment and fluctuation dynamically creates and annihilates order. By enabling the direct visualization of when and where a given system is out of equilibrium, we anticipate that our methodology will advance the understanding of a broad class of complex nonequilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Neyman Regret for Adaptive Estimation of the Average Treatment Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a core problem in causal inference with strong connections to Off-Policy Evaluation in Reinforcement Learning. This paper considers the problem of adaptively selecting the treatment allocation probability in order to improve estimation of the ATE. The majority of prior work on adaptive ATE estimation focus on asymptotic guarantees, and in turn overlooks important practical considerations such as the difficulty of learning the optimal treatment allocation as well as hyper-parameter selection. Existing non-asymptotic methods are limited by poor empirical performance and exponential scaling of the Neyman regret with respect to problem parameters. In order to address these gaps, we propose and analyze the Clipped Second Moment Tracking (ClipSMT) algorithm, a variant of an existing algorithm with strong asymptotic optimality guarantees, and provide finite sample bounds on its Neyman regret. Our analysis shows that ClipSMT achieves exponential improvements in Neyman regret on two fronts: improving the dependence on $T$ from $O(\sqrt{T})$ to $O(\log T)$, as well as reducing the exponential dependence on problem parameters to a polynomial dependence. Finally, we conclude with simulations which show the marked improvement of ClipSMT over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Overcomplete Tensor Decomposition via Koszul-Young Flattenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by connections between algebraic complexity lower bounds and tensor decompositions, we investigate Koszul-Young flattenings, which are the main ingredient in recent lower bounds for matrix multiplication. Based on this tool we give a new algorithm for decomposing an $n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3$ tensor as the sum of a minimal number of rank-1 terms, and certifying uniqueness of this decomposition. For $n_1 \le n_2 \le n_3$ with $n_1 \to \infty$ and $n_3/n_2 = O(1)$, our algorithm is guaranteed to succeed when the tensor rank is bounded by $r \le (1-\epsilon)(n_2 + n_3)$ for an arbitrary $\epsilon &gt; 0$, provided the tensor components are generically chosen. For any fixed $\epsilon$, the runtime is polynomial in $n_3$. When $n_2 = n_3 = n$, our condition on the rank gives a factor-of-2 improvement over the classical simultaneous diagonalization algorithm, which requires $r \le n$, and also improves on the recent algorithm of Koiran (2024) which requires $r \le 4n/3$. It also improves on the PhD thesis of Persu (2018) which solves rank detection for $r \leq 3n/2$.
  We complement our upper bounds by showing limitations, in particular that no flattening of the style we consider can surpass rank $n_2 + n_3$. Furthermore, for $n \times n \times n$ tensors, we show that an even more general class of degree-$d$ polynomial flattenings cannot surpass rank $Cn$ for a constant $C = C(d)$. This suggests that for tensor decompositions, the case of generic components may be fundamentally harder than that of random components, where efficient decomposition is possible even in highly overcomplete settings.</description>

      <title>Indiscriminate Disruption of Conditional Inference on Multivariate Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multivariate Gaussian distribution underpins myriad operations-research, decision-analytic, and machine-learning models (e.g., Bayesian optimization, Gaussian influence diagrams, and variational autoencoders). However, despite recent advances in adversarial machine learning (AML), inference for Gaussian models in the presence of an adversary is notably understudied. Therefore, we consider a self-interested attacker who wishes to disrupt a decisionmaker's conditional inference and subsequent actions by corrupting a set of evidentiary variables. To avoid detection, the attacker also desires the attack to appear plausible wherein plausibility is determined by the density of the corrupted evidence. We consider white- and grey-box settings such that the attacker has complete and incomplete knowledge about the decisionmaker's underlying multivariate Gaussian distribution, respectively. Select instances are shown to reduce to quadratic and stochastic quadratic programs, and structural properties are derived to inform solution methods. We assess the impact and efficacy of these attacks in three examples, including, real estate evaluation, interest rate estimation and signals processing. Each example leverages an alternative underlying model, thereby highlighting the attacks' broad applicability. Through these applications, we also juxtapose the behavior of the white- and grey-box attacks to understand how uncertainty and structure affect attacker behavior.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation with Deep Learning and Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for accurate clinical diagnoses, yet it faces challenges such as low contrast between lesions and normal tissues, unclear boundaries, and high variability across patients. Deep learning has improved segmentation accuracy and efficiency, but it still relies heavily on expert annotations and struggles with the complexities of medical images. The small size of medical image datasets and the high cost of data acquisition further limit the performance of segmentation networks. Diffusion models, with their iterative denoising process, offer a promising alternative for better detail capture in segmentation. However, they face difficulties in accurately segmenting small targets and maintaining the precision of boundary details. This article discusses the importance of medical image segmentation, the limitations of current deep learning approaches, and the potential of diffusion models to address these challenges.</description>

      <title>CoNFiLD-inlet: Synthetic Turbulence Inflow Using Generative Latent Diffusion Models with Neural Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eddy-resolving turbulence simulations require stochastic inflow conditions that accurately replicate the complex, multi-scale structures of turbulence. Traditional recycling-based methods rely on computationally expensive precursor simulations, while existing synthetic inflow generators often fail to reproduce realistic coherent structures of turbulence. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have opened new possibilities for inflow turbulence generation, yet many DL-based methods rely on deterministic, autoregressive frameworks prone to error accumulation, resulting in poor robustness for long-term predictions. In this work, we present CoNFiLD-inlet, a novel DL-based inflow turbulence generator that integrates diffusion models with a conditional neural field (CNF)-encoded latent space to produce realistic, stochastic inflow turbulence. By parameterizing inflow conditions using Reynolds numbers, CoNFiLD-inlet generalizes effectively across a wide range of Reynolds numbers ($Re_\tau$ between $10^3$ and $10^4$) without requiring retraining or parameter tuning. Comprehensive validation through a priori and a posteriori tests in Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulation (WMLES) demonstrates its high fidelity, robustness, and scalability, positioning it as an efficient and versatile solution for inflow turbulence synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. Based on this framework, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only outperforms traditional bond-orientational order parameters in phase classification tasks but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Training: Dynamic Token Merging for Zero-Shot Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new avenues for video understanding. However, achieving high fidelity in zero-shot video tasks remains challenging. Traditional video processing methods rely heavily on fine-tuning to capture nuanced spatial-temporal details, which incurs significant data and computation costs. In contrast, training-free approaches, though efficient, often lack robustness in preserving context-rich features across complex video content. To this end, we propose DYTO, a novel dynamic token merging framework for zero-shot video understanding that adaptively optimizes token efficiency while preserving crucial scene details. DYTO integrates a hierarchical frame selection and a bipartite token merging strategy to dynamically cluster key frames and selectively compress token sequences, striking a balance between computational efficiency with semantic richness. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DYTO, achieving superior performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods and setting a new state-of-the-art for zero-shot video understanding.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Autoregressive Pre-training of Large Vision Encoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for pre-training of large-scale vision encoders. Building on recent advancements in autoregressive pre-training of vision models, we extend this framework to a multimodal setting, i.e., images and text. In this paper, we present AIMV2, a family of generalist vision encoders characterized by a straightforward pre-training process, scalability, and remarkable performance across a range of downstream tasks. This is achieved by pairing the vision encoder with a multimodal decoder that autoregressively generates raw image patches and text tokens. Our encoders excel not only in multimodal evaluations but also in vision benchmarks such as localization, grounding, and classification. Notably, our AIMV2-3B encoder achieves 89.5% accuracy on ImageNet-1k with a frozen trunk. Furthermore, AIMV2 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) in multimodal image understanding across diverse settings.</description>

      <title>Stable Flow: Vital Layers for Training-Free Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of content synthesis and editing. Recent models have replaced the traditional UNet architecture with the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), and employed flow-matching for improved training and sampling. However, they exhibit limited generation diversity. In this work, we leverage this limitation to perform consistent image edits via selective injection of attention features. The main challenge is that, unlike the UNet-based models, DiT lacks a coarse-to-fine synthesis structure, making it unclear in which layers to perform the injection. Therefore, we propose an automatic method to identify "vital layers" within DiT, crucial for image formation, and demonstrate how these layers facilitate a range of controlled stable edits, from non-rigid modifications to object addition, using the same mechanism. Next, to enable real-image editing, we introduce an improved image inversion method for flow models. Finally, we evaluate our approach through qualitative and quantitative comparisons, along with a user study, and demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple applications.

      <title>Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process</title>

Abstract: Variational approximations to Gaussian processes (GPs) typically use a small set of inducing points to form a low-rank approximation to the covariance matrix. In this work, we instead exploit a sparse approximation of the precision matrix. We propose variational nearest neighbor Gaussian process (VNNGP), which introduces a prior that only retains correlations within $K$ nearest-neighboring observations, thereby inducing sparse precision structure. Using the variational framework, VNNGP's objective can be factorized over both observations and inducing points, enabling stochastic optimization with a time complexity of $O(K^3)$. Hence, we can arbitrarily scale the inducing point size, even to the point of putting inducing points at every observed location. We compare VNNGP to other scalable GPs through various experiments, and demonstrate that VNNGP (1) can dramatically outperform low-rank methods, and (2) is less prone to overfitting than other nearest neighbor methods.</description>

      <title>Decision-Focused Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Reward Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) provides a way to learn a transition model of the environment, which can then be used to plan personalized policies for different patient cohorts and to understand the dynamics involved in the decision-making process. However, standard MBRL algorithms are either sensitive to changes in the reward function or achieve suboptimal performance on the task when the transition model is restricted. Motivated by the need to use simple and interpretable models in critical domains such as healthcare, we propose a novel robust decision-focused (RDF) algorithm that learns a transition model that achieves high returns while being robust to changes in the reward function. We demonstrate our RDF algorithm can be used with several model classes and planning algorithms. We also provide theoretical and empirical evidence, on a variety of simulators and real patient data, that RDF can learn simple yet effective models that can be used to plan personalized policies.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we assess the theoretical limitations of determining guaranteed stability and accuracy of neural networks in classification tasks. We consider classical distribution-agnostic framework and algorithms minimising empirical risks and potentially subjected to some weights regularisation. We show that there is a large family of tasks for which computing and verifying ideal stable and accurate neural networks in the above settings is extremely challenging, if at all possible, even when such ideal solutions exist within the given class of neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Adversarial Transferability in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a specific security risk in FL: a group of malicious clients has impacted the model during training by disguising their identities and acting as benign clients but later switching to an adversarial role. They use their data, which was part of the training set, to train a substitute model and conduct transferable adversarial attacks against the federated model. This type of attack is subtle and hard to detect because these clients initially appear to be benign.
  The key question we address is: How robust is the FL system to such covert attacks, especially compared to traditional centralized learning systems? We empirically show that the proposed attack imposes a high security risk to current FL systems. By using only 3\% of the client's data, we achieve the highest attack rate of over 80\%. To further offer a full understanding of the challenges the FL system faces in transferable attacks, we provide a comprehensive analysis over the transfer robustness of FL across a spectrum of configurations. Surprisingly, FL systems show a higher level of robustness than their centralized counterparts, especially when both systems are equally good at handling regular, non-malicious data.
  We attribute this increased robustness to two main factors: 1) Decentralized Data Training: Each client trains the model on its own data, reducing the overall impact of any single malicious client. 2) Model Update Averaging: The updates from each client are averaged together, further diluting any malicious alterations. Both practical experiments and theoretical analysis support our conclusions. This research not only sheds light on the resilience of FL systems against hidden attacks but also raises important considerations for their future application and development.</description>

      <title>Data-centric Graph Learning: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The history of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed the significant impact of high-quality data on various deep learning models, such as ImageNet for AlexNet and ResNet. Recently, instead of designing more complex neural architectures as model-centric approaches, the attention of AI community has shifted to data-centric ones, which focuses on better processing data to strengthen the ability of neural models. Graph learning, which operates on ubiquitous topological data, also plays an important role in the era of deep learning. In this survey, we comprehensively review graph learning approaches from the data-centric perspective, and aim to answer three crucial questions: (1) when to modify graph data, (2) what part of the graph data needs modification to unlock the potential of various graph models, and (3) how to safeguard graph models from problematic data influence. Accordingly, we propose a novel taxonomy based on the stages in the graph learning pipeline, and highlight the processing methods for different data structures in the graph data, i.e., topology, feature and label. Furthermore, we analyze some potential problems embedded in graph data and discuss how to solve them in a data-centric manner. Finally, we provide some promising future directions for data-centric graph learning.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Information-sharing Convolutional Neural Network for the Prediction of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration and Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea ice velocity (SIV) in the Arctic Ocean is of great significance as the Arctic environment has been changed by the recent warming climate. Given that physical sea ice models require high computational costs with complex parameterization, deep learning techniques can effectively replace the physical model and improve the performance of sea ice prediction. This study proposes a novel multi-task fully conventional network architecture named hierarchical information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) to predict daily SIC and SIV. Instead of learning SIC and SIV separately at each branch, we allow the SIC and SIV layers to share their information and assist each other's prediction through the weighting attention modules (WAMs). Consequently, our HIS-Unet outperforms other statistical approaches, sea ice physical models, and neural networks without such information-sharing units. The improvement of HIS-Unet is more significant to when and where SIC changes seasonally, which implies that the information sharing between SIC and SIV through WAMs helps learn the dynamic changes of SIC and SIV. The weight values of the WAMs imply that SIC information plays a more critical role in SIV prediction, compared to that of SIV information in SIC prediction, and information sharing is more active in marginal ice zones (e.g., East Greenland and Hudson/Baffin Bays) than in the central Arctic.</description>

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to optimize multiple, possibly conflicting objectives with widespread applications. We introduce a novel interacting particle method for MOO inspired by molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach combines overdamped Langevin and birth-death dynamics, incorporating a "dominance potential" to steer particles toward global Pareto optimality. In contrast to previous methods, our method is able to relocate dominated particles, making it particularly adept at managing Pareto fronts of complicated geometries. Our method is also theoretically grounded as a Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flow with convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>KOPPA: Improving Prompt-based Continual Learning with Key-Query Orthogonal Projection and Prototype-based One-Versus-All</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from prompt tuning techniques applied to Large Language Models, recent methods based on pre-trained ViT networks have achieved remarkable results in the field of Continual Learning. Specifically, these approaches propose to maintain a set of prompts and allocate a subset of them to learn each task using a key-query matching strategy. However, they may encounter limitations when lacking control over the correlations between old task queries and keys of future tasks, the shift of features in the latent space, and the relative separation of latent vectors learned in independent tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel key-query learning strategy based on orthogonal projection, inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning, to enhance prompt matching efficiency and address the challenge of shifting features. Furthermore, we introduce a One-Versus-All (OVA) prototype-based component that enhances the classification head distinction. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method empowers the model to achieve results surpassing those of current state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin of up to 20%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data markets facilitate decentralized data exchange for applications such as prediction, learning, or inference. The design of these markets is challenged by varying privacy preferences as well as data similarity among data owners. Related works have often overlooked how data similarity impacts pricing and data value through statistical information leakage. We demonstrate that data similarity and privacy preferences are integral to market design and propose a query-response protocol using local differential privacy for a two-party data acquisition mechanism. In our regression data market model, we analyze strategic interactions between privacy-aware owners and the learner as a Stackelberg game over the asked price and privacy factor. Finally, we numerically evaluate how data similarity affects market participation and traded data value.</description>

Abstract: While graph convolutional networks show great practical promises, the theoretical understanding of their generalization properties as a function of the number of samples is still in its infancy compared to the more broadly studied case of supervised fully connected neural networks. In this article, we predict the performances of a single-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) trained on data produced by attributed stochastic block models (SBMs) in the high-dimensional limit. Previously, only ridge regression on contextual-SBM (CSBM) has been considered in Shi et al. 2022; we generalize the analysis to arbitrary convex loss and regularization for the CSBM and add the analysis for another data model, the neural-prior SBM. We also study the high signal-to-noise ratio limit, detail the convergence rates of the GCN and show that, while consistent, it does not reach the Bayes-optimal rate for any of the considered cases.</description>

      <title>Closing the Gap Between SGP4 and High-Precision Propagation via Differentiable Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04830v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Simplified General Perturbations 4 (SGP4) orbital propagation method is widely used for predicting the positions and velocities of Earth-orbiting objects rapidly and reliably. Despite continuous refinement, SGP models still lack the precision of numerical propagators, which offer significantly smaller errors. This study presents dSGP4, a novel differentiable version of SGP4 implemented using PyTorch. By making SGP4 differentiable, dSGP4 facilitates various space-related applications, including spacecraft orbit determination, state conversion, covariance transformation, state transition matrix computation, and covariance propagation. Additionally, dSGP4's PyTorch implementation allows for embarrassingly parallel orbital propagation across batches of Two-Line Element Sets (TLEs), leveraging the computational power of CPUs, GPUs, and advanced hardware for distributed prediction of satellite positions at future times. Furthermore, dSGP4's differentiability enables integration with modern machine learning techniques. Thus, we propose a novel orbital propagation paradigm, ML-dSGP4, where neural networks are integrated into the orbital propagator. Through stochastic gradient descent, this combined model's inputs, outputs, and parameters can be iteratively refined, surpassing SGP4's precision. Neural networks act as identity operators by default, adhering to SGP4's behavior. However, dSGP4's differentiability allows fine-tuning with ephemeris data, enhancing precision while maintaining computational speed. This empowers satellite operators and researchers to train the model using specific ephemeris or high-precision numerical propagation data, significantly advancing orbital prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>Majority Kernels: An Approach to Leverage Big Model Dynamics for Efficient Small Model Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and successful deployment of large language and vision models in a constrained environment predominantly follow a two phase approach. First, large models are trained to achieve peak performance, followed by a model shrinking method to meet hardware constraints; Methods like distillation, compression or quantization help leverage the highly performant large models to induce smaller performant ones. Formally, this can be seen as the problem of identifying an optimal model of size $n$ from a larger model of size $k \cdot n$, where $k &gt; 1$ is the overparameterization factor. This paper explores the hypothesis that a single training run can simultaneously train a larger model for performance and derive a smaller model for deployment.
  Our contribution is an effective architectural change, namely, {\it Majority Kernels} that is compatible with the main standard architectures such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), Residual networks (ResNets), and Transformers. We demonstrate that applying our technique can modify the training dynamics resulting in performance gains across architectures and tasks while maintaining the inference performance consistent. Furthermore, our approach adds minimal overhead to the cost incurred (wall clock time) at training time. The proposed approach shows strong performance on a wide variety of datasets and models, even outperforming strong baselines such as distilled ensembles as well as combinatorial optimization methods based on submodular optimization.</description>

      <title>Graph convolutional network as a fast statistical emulator for numerical ice sheet modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) provides numerical solutions for ice sheet dynamics using finite element and fine mesh adaption. However, considering ISSM is compatible only with central processing units (CPUs), it has limitations in economizing computational time to explore the linkage between climate forcings and ice dynamics. Although several deep learning emulators using graphic processing units (GPUs) have been proposed to accelerate ice sheet modeling, most of them rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for regular grids. Since they are not appropriate for the irregular meshes of ISSM, we use a graph convolutional network (GCN) to replicate the adapted mesh structures of the ISSM. When applied to transient simulations of the Pine Island Glacier (PIG), Antarctica, the GCN successfully reproduces ice thickness and velocity with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.997, outperforming non-graph models, including fully convolutional network (FCN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Compared to the fixed-resolution approach of the FCN, the flexible-resolution structure of the GCN accurately captures detailed ice dynamics in fast-ice regions. By leveraging 60-100 times faster computational time of the GPU-based GCN emulator, we efficiently examine the impacts of basal melting rates on the ice sheet dynamics in the PIG.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the computational power of neural networks that follow the graph neural network (GNN) architecture, not restricted to aggregate-combine GNNs or other particular types. We establish an exact correspondence between the expressivity of GNNs using diverse activation functions and arithmetic circuits over real numbers. In our results the activation function of the network becomes a gate type in the circuit. Our result holds for families of constant depth circuits and networks, both uniformly and non-uniformly, for all common activation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of machine learning, seamless translation of natural language descriptions into executable code remains a formidable challenge. This paper introduces Linguacodus, an innovative framework designed to tackle this challenge by deploying a dynamic pipeline that iteratively transforms natural language task descriptions into code through high-level data-shaping instructions. The core of Linguacodus is a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), empowered to evaluate diverse solutions for various problems and select the most fitting one for a given task. This paper details the fine-tuning process, and sheds light on how natural language descriptions can be translated into functional code. Linguacodus represents a substantial leap towards automated code generation, effectively bridging the gap between task descriptions and executable code. It holds great promise for advancing machine learning applications across diverse domains. Additionally, we propose an algorithm capable of transforming a natural description of an ML task into code with minimal human interaction.

      <title>Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Domain Reinforcement Learning: A Systematic Review</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a framework in which agents can be trained, via trial and error, to solve complex decision-making problems. Learning with little supervision causes RL methods to require large amounts of data, rendering them too expensive for many applications (e.g., robotics). By reusing knowledge from a different task, knowledge transfer methods present an alternative to reduce the training time in RL. Given the severe data scarcity, due to their flexibility, there has been a growing interest in methods capable of transferring knowledge across different domains (i.e., problems with different representations). However, identifying similarities and adapting knowledge across tasks from different domains requires matching their representations or finding domain-invariant features. These processes can be data-demanding, which poses the main challenge in cross-domain knowledge transfer: to select and transform knowledge in a data-efficient way, such that it accelerates learning in the target task, despite the presence of significant differences across problems (e.g., robots with distinct morphologies). Thus, this review presents a unifying analysis of methods focused on transferring knowledge across different domains. Through a taxonomy based on a transfer-approach categorization and a characterization of works based on their data-assumption requirements, the contributions of this article are 1) a comprehensive and systematic revision of knowledge transfer methods for the cross-domain RL setting, 2) a categorization and characterization of such methods to provide an analysis based on relevant features such as their transfer approach and data requirements, and 3) a discussion on the main challenges regarding cross-domain knowledge transfer, as well as on ideas of future directions worth exploring to address these problems.</description>

      <title>HoneyBee: A Scalable Modular Framework for Creating Multimodal Oncology Datasets with Foundational Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07460v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing accurate machine learning models for oncology requires large-scale, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, creating such datasets remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data. To address this challenge, we introduce HoneyBee, a scalable modular framework for building multimodal oncology datasets that leverages foundation models to generate representative embeddings. HoneyBee integrates various data modalities, including clinical diagnostic and pathology imaging data, medical notes, reports, records, and molecular data. It employs data preprocessing techniques and foundation models to generate embeddings that capture the essential features and relationships within the raw medical data. The generated embeddings are stored in a structured format using Hugging Face datasets and PyTorch dataloaders for accessibility. Vector databases enable efficient querying and retrieval for machine learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HoneyBee through experiments assessing the quality and representativeness of these embeddings. The framework is designed to be extensible to other medical domains and aims to accelerate oncology research by providing high-quality, machine learning-ready datasets. HoneyBee is an ongoing open-source effort, and the code, datasets, and models are available at the project repository.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Distributed Deep Learning via Federated Dynamic Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20988v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ever-growing volume and decentralized nature of data, coupled with the need to harness it and extract knowledge, have led to the extensive use of distributed deep learning (DDL) techniques for training. These techniques rely on local training performed at distributed nodes using locally collected data, followed by a periodic synchronization process that combines these models to create a unified global model. However, the frequent synchronization of deep learning models, encompassing millions to many billions of parameters, creates a communication bottleneck, severely hindering scalability. Worse yet, DDL algorithms typically waste valuable bandwidth and render themselves less practical in bandwidth-constrained federated settings by relying on overly simplistic, periodic, and rigid synchronization schedules. These inefficiencies make the training process increasingly impractical as they demand excessive time for data communication. To address these shortcomings, we propose Federated Dynamic Averaging (FDA), a communication-efficient DDL strategy that dynamically triggers synchronization based on the value of the model variance. In essence, the costly synchronization step is triggered only if the local models -- initialized from a common global model after each synchronization -- have significantly diverged. This decision is facilitated by the transmission of a small local state from each distributed node. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of learning tasks we demonstrate that FDA reduces communication cost by orders of magnitude, compared to both traditional and cutting-edge communication-efficient algorithms. Additionally, we show that FDA maintains robust performance across diverse data heterogeneity settings.</description>

Abstract: Text embeddings are essential for many tasks, such as document retrieval, clustering, and semantic similarity assessment. In this paper, we study how to contrastively train text embedding models in a compute-optimal fashion, given a suite of pre-trained decoder-only language models. Our innovation is an algorithm that produces optimal configurations of model sizes, data quantities, and fine-tuning methods for text-embedding models at different computational budget levels. The resulting recipe, which we obtain through extensive experiments, can be used by practitioners to make informed design choices for their embedding models. Specifically, our findings suggest that full fine-tuning and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning produce optimal models at lower and higher computational budgets respectively.</description>

      <title>Graph Knowledge Distillation to Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In terms of accuracy, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the best architectural choice for the node classification task. Their drawback in real-world deployment is the latency that emerges from the neighbourhood processing operation. One solution to the latency issue is to perform knowledge distillation from a trained GNN to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), where the MLP processes only the features of the node being classified (and possibly some pre-computed structural information). However, the performance of such MLPs in both transductive and inductive settings remains inconsistent for existing knowledge distillation techniques. We propose to address the performance concerns by using a specially-designed student model instead of an MLP. Our model, named Routing-by-Memory (RbM), is a form of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), with a design that enforces expert specialization. By encouraging each expert to specialize on a certain region on the hidden representation space, we demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to derive considerably more consistent performance across multiple datasets.

      <title>Large Scale Transfer Learning for Tabular Data via Language Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular data -- structured, heterogeneous, spreadsheet-style data with rows and columns -- is widely used in practice across many domains. However, while recent foundation models have reduced the need for developing task-specific datasets and predictors in domains such as language modeling and computer vision, this transfer learning paradigm has not had similar impact in the tabular domain. In this work, we seek to narrow this gap and present TabuLa-8B, a language model for tabular prediction. We define a process for extracting a large, high-quality training dataset from the TabLib corpus, proposing methods for tabular data filtering and quality control. Using the resulting dataset, which comprises over 2.1B rows from over 4M unique tables, we fine-tune a Llama 3-8B large language model (LLM) for tabular data prediction (classification and binned regression) using a novel packing and attention scheme for tabular prediction. Through evaluation across a test suite of 329 datasets, we find that TabuLa-8B has zero-shot accuracy on unseen tables that is over 15 percentage points (pp) higher than random guessing, a feat that is not possible with existing state-of-the-art tabular prediction models (e.g. XGBoost, TabPFN). In the few-shot setting (1-32 shots), without any fine-tuning on the target datasets, TabuLa-8B is 5-15 pp more accurate than XGBoost and TabPFN models that are explicitly trained on equal, or even up to 16x more data. We release our model, code, and data along with the publication of this paper.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Kaplan and Chinchilla Scaling Laws</title>

Abstract: Kaplan et al. [2020] (`Kaplan') and Hoffmann et al. [2022] (`Chinchilla') studied the scaling behavior of transformers trained on next-token language prediction. These studies produced different estimates for how the number of parameters ($N$) and training tokens ($D$) should be set to achieve the lowest possible loss for a given compute budget ($C$). Kaplan: $N_\text{optimal} \propto C^{0.73}$, Chinchilla: $N_\text{optimal} \propto C^{0.50}$. This paper finds that much of this discrepancy can be attributed to Kaplan counting non-embedding rather than total parameters, combined with their analysis being performed at small scale. Simulating the Chinchilla study under these conditions produces biased scaling coefficients close to Kaplan's. Hence, this paper reaffirms Chinchilla's scaling coefficients, by explaining the primary cause of Kaplan's original overestimation. As a second contribution, the paper explains differences in the reported relationships between loss and compute. These findings lead us to recommend that future scaling studies use total parameters and compute.</description>

      <title>Truthfulness of Calibration Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the truthfulness of calibration measures in sequential prediction. A calibration measure is said to be truthful if the forecaster (approximately) minimizes the expected penalty by predicting the conditional expectation of the next outcome, given the prior distribution of outcomes. Truthfulness is an important property of calibration measures, ensuring that the forecaster is not incentivized to exploit the system with deliberate poor forecasts. This makes it an essential desideratum for calibration measures, alongside typical requirements, such as soundness and completeness.
  We conduct a taxonomy of existing calibration measures and their truthfulness. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that all of them are far from being truthful. That is, under existing calibration measures, there are simple distributions on which a polylogarithmic (or even zero) penalty is achievable, while truthful prediction leads to a polynomial penalty. Our main contribution is the introduction of a new calibration measure termed the Subsampled Smooth Calibration Error (SSCE) under which truthful prediction is optimal up to a constant multiplicative factor.</description>

      <title>Robust Fast Adaptation from Adversarially Explicit Task Distribution Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-learning is a practical learning paradigm to transfer skills across tasks from a few examples. Nevertheless, the existence of task distribution shifts tends to weaken meta-learners' generalization capability, particularly when the training task distribution is naively hand-crafted or based on simple priors that fail to cover critical scenarios sufficiently. Here, we consider explicitly generative modeling task distributions placed over task identifiers and propose robustifying fast adaptation from adversarial training. Our approach, which can be interpreted as a model of a Stackelberg game, not only uncovers the task structure during problem-solving from an explicit generative model but also theoretically increases the adaptation robustness in worst cases. This work has practical implications, particularly in dealing with task distribution shifts in meta-learning, and contributes to theoretical insights in the field. Our method demonstrates its robustness in the presence of task subpopulation shifts and improved performance over SOTA baselines in extensive experiments. The code will be available at the project site https://sites.google.com/view/ar-metalearn.</description>

Abstract: The Rectified Power Unit (RePU) activation functions, unlike the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), have the advantage of being a differentiable function when constructing neural networks. However, it can be experimentally observed when deep layers are stacked, neural networks constructed with RePU encounter critical issues. These issues include the values exploding or vanishing and failure of training. And these happen regardless of the hyperparameter initialization. From the perspective of effective theory, we aim to identify the causes of this phenomenon and propose a new activation function that retains the advantages of RePU while overcoming its drawbacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trained neural networks (NN) have attractive features for closing governing equations. There are many methods that are showing promise, but all can fail in cases when small errors consequentially violate physical reality, such as a solution boundedness condition. A NN formulation is introduced to preclude spurious oscillations that violate solution boundedness or positivity. It is embedded in the discretized equations as a machine learning closure and strictly constrained, inspired by total variation diminishing (TVD) methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. The constraint is exactly enforced during gradient-descent training by rescaling the NN parameters, which maps them onto an explicit feasible set. Demonstrations show that the constrained NN closure model usefully recovers linear and nonlinear hyperbolic phenomena and anti-diffusion while enforcing the non-oscillatory property. Finally, the model is applied to subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling of a turbulent reacting flow, for which it suppresses spurious oscillations in scalar fields that otherwise violate the solution boundedness. It outperforms a simple penalization of oscillations in the loss function.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Transfer Learning for Contextual Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach to complex decision making. However, one issue that limits its practical application is its brittleness, sometimes failing to train in the presence of small changes in the environment. Motivated by the success of zero-shot transfer-where pre-trained models perform well on related tasks-we consider the problem of selecting a good set of training tasks to maximize generalization performance across a range of tasks. Given the high cost of training, it is critical to select training tasks strategically, but not well understood how to do so. We hence introduce Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL), which layers on top of existing RL methods to effectively solve contextual RL problems. MBTL models the generalization performance in two parts: 1) the performance set point, modeled using Gaussian processes, and 2) performance loss (generalization gap), modeled as a linear function of contextual similarity. MBTL combines these two pieces of information within a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework to strategically select training tasks. We show theoretically that the method exhibits sublinear regret in the number of training tasks and discuss conditions to further tighten regret bounds. We experimentally validate our methods using urban traffic and standard continuous control benchmarks. The experimental results suggest that MBTL can achieve up to 50x improved sample efficiency compared with canonical independent training and multi-task training. Further experiments demonstrate the efficacy of BO and the insensitivity to the underlying RL algorithm and hyperparameters. This work lays the foundations for investigating explicit modeling of generalization, thereby enabling principled yet effective methods for contextual RL.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Zero-shot Graph Learners: Alignment of GNN Representations with LLM Token Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multitask Learning Using Gradient-based Estimation of Task Affinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multitask learning is a widely used paradigm for training models on diverse tasks, with applications ranging from graph neural networks to language model fine-tuning. Since tasks may interfere with each other, a key notion for modeling their relationships is task affinity. This includes pairwise task affinity, computed among pairs of tasks, and higher-order affinity, computed among subsets of tasks. Naively computing either of them requires repeatedly training on data from various task combinations, which is computationally intensive. We present a new algorithm Grad-TAG that can estimate task affinities without this repeated training.
  The key idea of Grad-TAG is to train a "base" model for all tasks and then use a linearization technique to estimate the loss of the model for a specific task combination. The linearization works by computing a gradient-based approximation of the loss, using low-dimensional projections of gradients as features in a logistic regression to predict labels for the task combination. We show that the linearized model can provably approximate the loss when the gradient-based approximation is accurate, and also empirically verify that on several large models. Then, given the estimated task affinity, we design a semi-definite program for clustering similar tasks by maximizing the average density of clusters.
  We evaluate Grad-TAG's performance across seven datasets, including multi-label classification on graphs, and instruction fine-tuning of language models. Our task affinity estimates are within 2.7% distance to the true affinities while needing only 3% of FLOPs in full training. On our largest graph with 21M edges and 500 labeling tasks, our algorithm delivers estimates within 5% distance to the true affinities, using only 112 GPU hours. Our results show that Grad-TAG achieves excellent performance and runtime tradeoffs compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>The Role of Deep Learning Regularizations on Actors in Offline RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning regularization techniques, such as dropout, layer normalization, or weight decay, are widely adopted in the construction of modern artificial neural networks, often resulting in more robust training processes and improved generalization capabilities. However, in the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), the application of these techniques has been limited, usually applied to value function estimators (Hiraoka et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022), and may result in detrimental effects. This issue is even more pronounced in offline RL settings, which bear greater similarity to supervised learning but have received less attention. Recent work in continuous offline RL (Park et al., 2024) has demonstrated that while we can build sufficiently powerful critic networks, the generalization of actor networks remains a bottleneck. In this study, we empirically show that applying standard regularization techniques to actor networks in offline RL actor-critic algorithms yields improvements of 6% on average across two algorithms and three different continuous D4RL domains.</description>

      <title>The Digital Transformation in Health: How AI Can Improve the Performance of Health Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile health has the potential to revolutionize health care delivery and patient engagement. In this work, we discuss how integrating Artificial Intelligence into digital health applications-focused on supply chain, patient management, and capacity building, among other use cases-can improve the health system and public health performance. We present an Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning platform that allows the delivery of adaptive interventions whose impact can be optimized through experimentation and real-time monitoring. The system can integrate multiple data sources and digital health applications. The flexibility of this platform to connect to various mobile health applications and digital devices and send personalized recommendations based on past data and predictions can significantly improve the impact of digital tools on health system outcomes. The potential for resource-poor settings, where the impact of this approach on health outcomes could be more decisive, is discussed specifically. This framework is, however, similarly applicable to improving efficiency in health systems where scarcity is not an issue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how representation learning can improve the learning efficiency of contextual bandit problems. We study the setting where we play T contextual linear bandits with dimension d simultaneously, and these T bandit tasks collectively share a common linear representation with a dimensionality of r much smaller than d. We present a new algorithm based on alternating projected gradient descent (GD) and minimization estimator to recover a low-rank feature matrix. Using the proposed estimator, we present a multi-task learning algorithm for linear contextual bandits and prove the regret bound of our algorithm. We presented experiments and compared the performance of our algorithm against benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Differentiable Weightless Neural Network (DWN), a model based on interconnected lookup tables. Training of DWNs is enabled by a novel Extended Finite Difference technique for approximate differentiation of binary values. We propose Learnable Mapping, Learnable Reduction, and Spectral Regularization to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models. We evaluate DWNs in three edge computing contexts: (1) an FPGA-based hardware accelerator, where they demonstrate superior latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and model area compared to state-of-the-art solutions, (2) a low-power microcontroller, where they achieve preferable accuracy to XGBoost while subject to stringent memory constraints, and (3) ultra-low-cost chips, where they consistently outperform small models in both accuracy and projected hardware area. DWNs also compare favorably against leading approaches for tabular datasets, with higher average rank. Overall, our work positions DWNs as a pioneering solution for edge-compatible high-throughput neural networks.</description>

      <title>Toward a Well-Calibrated Discrimination via Survival Outcome-Aware Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous deep learning approaches for survival analysis have primarily relied on ranking losses to improve discrimination performance, which often comes at the expense of calibration performance. To address such an issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach specifically designed to enhance discrimination \textit{without} sacrificing calibration. Our method employs weighted sampling within a contrastive learning framework, assigning lower penalties to samples with similar survival outcomes. This aligns well with the assumption that patients with similar event times share similar clinical statuses. Consequently, when augmented with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss, our approach significantly improves discrimination performance without directly manipulating the model outputs, thereby achieving better calibration. Experiments on multiple real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art deep survival models in both discrimination and calibration. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we further validate the effectiveness of our approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses.</description>

      <title>Generation through the lens of learning theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study generation through the lens of statistical learning theory. First, we abstract and formalize the results of Gold [1967], Angluin [1979], Angluin [1980] and Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024] in terms of a binary hypothesis class defined over an abstract example space. Then, we extend the notion of "generation" from Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024] to two new settings, we call "uniform" and "non-uniform" generation, and provide a characterization of which hypothesis classes are uniformly and non-uniformly generatable. As is standard in learning theory, our characterizations are in terms of the finiteness of a new combinatorial dimension termed the Closure dimension. By doing so, we are able to compare generatability with predictability (captured via PAC and online learnability) and show that these two properties of hypothesis classes are incompatible -- there are classes that are generatable but not predictable and vice versa. Finally, we extend our results to capture prompted generation and give a complete characterization of which classes are prompt generatable, generalizing some of the work by Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024].</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning on Transformers for Building Energy Consumption Forecasting -- A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Transfer Learning (TL) on Transformer architectures to enhance building energy consumption forecasting. Transformers are a relatively new deep learning architecture, which has served as the foundation for groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT. While TL has been studied in the past, prior studies considered either one data-centric TL strategy or used older deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks. Here, we carry out an extensive empirical study on six different data-centric TL strategies and analyse their performance under varying feature spaces. In addition to the vanilla Transformer architecture, we also experiment with Informer and PatchTST, specifically designed for time series forecasting. We use 16 datasets from the Building Data Genome Project 2 to create building energy consumption forecasting models. Experimental results reveal that while TL is generally beneficial, especially when the target domain has no data, careful selection of the exact TL strategy should be made to gain the maximum benefit. This decision largely depends on the feature space properties such as the recorded weather features. We also note that PatchTST outperforms the other two Transformer variants (vanilla Transformer and Informer). Our findings advance the building energy consumption forecasting using advanced approaches like TL and Transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>WaveRoRA: Wavelet Rotary Route Attention for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leopold2333/WaveRoRA.</description>

      <title>Towards Generative Ray Path Sampling for Faster Point-to-Point Ray Tracing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio propagation modeling is essential in telecommunication research, as radio channels result from complex interactions with environmental objects. Recently, Machine Learning has been attracting attention as a potential alternative to computationally demanding tools, like Ray Tracing, which can model these interactions in detail. However, existing Machine Learning approaches often attempt to learn directly specific channel characteristics, such as the coverage map, making them highly specific to the frequency and material properties and unable to fully capture the underlying propagation mechanisms. Hence, Ray Tracing, particularly the Point-to-Point variant, remains popular to accurately identify all possible paths between transmitter and receiver nodes. Still, path identification is computationally intensive because the number of paths to be tested grows exponentially while only a small fraction is valid. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-aided Ray Tracing approach to efficiently sample potential ray paths, significantly reducing the computational load while maintaining high accuracy. Our model dynamically learns to prioritize potentially valid paths among all possible paths and scales linearly with scene complexity. Unlike recent alternatives, our approach is invariant with translation, scaling, or rotation of the geometry, and avoids dependency on specific environment characteristics.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Inference of Marginalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian reasoning in linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) is challenging and often requires advanced sampling techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A common approach is to write the model in a probabilistic programming language and then sample via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). However, there are many ways a user can transform a model that make inference more or less efficient. In particular, marginalizing some variables can greatly improve inference but is difficult for users to do manually. We develop an algorithm to easily marginalize random effects in LMMs. A naive approach introduces cubic time operations within an inference algorithm like HMC, but we reduce the running time to linear using fast linear algebra techniques. We show that marginalization is always beneficial when applicable and highlight improvements in various models, especially ones from cognitive sciences.</description>

      <title>Improving Steering Vectors by Targeting Sparse Autoencoder Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To control the behavior of language models, steering methods attempt to ensure that outputs of the model satisfy specific pre-defined properties. Adding steering vectors to the model is a promising method of model control that is easier than finetuning, and may be more robust than prompting. However, it can be difficult to anticipate the effects of steering vectors produced by methods such as CAA [Panickssery et al., 2024] or the direct use of SAE latents [Templeton et al., 2024]. In our work, we address this issue by using SAEs to measure the effects of steering vectors, giving us a method that can be used to understand the causal effect of any steering vector intervention. We use this method for measuring causal effects to develop an improved steering method, SAE-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS), which finds steering vectors to target specific SAE features while minimizing unintended side effects. We show that overall, SAE-TS balances steering effects with coherence better than CAA and SAE feature steering, when evaluated on a range of tasks.</description>

      <title>On Targeted Manipulation and Deception when Optimizing LLMs for User Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As LLMs become more widely deployed, there is increasing interest in directly optimizing for feedback from end users (e.g. thumbs up) in addition to feedback from paid annotators. However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative or deceptive tactics to obtain positive feedback from users who are vulnerable to such strategies. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage. In our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of "feedback gaming" such as manipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some of our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler manipulative behaviors. We hope our results can serve as a case study which highlights the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL.</description>

      <title>ADOPT: Modified Adam Can Converge with Any $\beta_2$ with the Optimal Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adam is one of the most popular optimization algorithms in deep learning. However, it is known that Adam does not converge in theory unless choosing a hyperparameter, i.e., $\beta_2$, in a problem-dependent manner. There have been many attempts to fix the non-convergence (e.g., AMSGrad), but they require an impractical assumption that the gradient noise is uniformly bounded. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive gradient method named ADOPT, which achieves the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O} ( 1 / \sqrt{T} )$ with any choice of $\beta_2$ without depending on the bounded noise assumption. ADOPT addresses the non-convergence issue of Adam by removing the current gradient from the second moment estimate and changing the order of the momentum update and the normalization by the second moment estimate. We also conduct intensive numerical experiments, and verify that our ADOPT achieves superior results compared to Adam and its variants across a wide range of tasks, including image classification, generative modeling, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning. The implementation is available at https://github.com/iShohei220/adopt.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Weight-Averaged Model-merging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weight-averaged model-merging has emerged as a powerful approach in deep learning, capable of enhancing model performance without fine-tuning or retraining. However, the underlying mechanisms that explain its effectiveness remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate this technique from three novel perspectives to provide deeper insights into how and why weight-averaged model-merging works: (1) we examine the intrinsic patterns captured by the learning of the model weights, through the visualizations of their patterns on several datasets, showing that these weights often encode structured and interpretable patterns; (2) we investigate model ensemble merging strategies based on averaging on weights versus averaging on features, providing detailed analyses across diverse architectures and datasets; and (3) we explore the impact on model-merging prediction stability in terms of changing the parameter magnitude, revealing insights into the way of weight averaging works as regularization by showing the robustness across different parameter scales. Our findings shed light on the "black box" of weight-averaged model-merging, offering valuable insights and practical recommendations that advance the model-merging process.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of distribution learning within the framework of learning-augmented algorithms. In this setting, we explore the scenario where a probability distribution is provided as potentially inaccurate advice on the true, unknown distribution. Our objective is to develop learning algorithms whose sample complexity decreases as the quality of the advice improves, thereby surpassing standard learning lower bounds when the advice is sufficiently accurate.
  Specifically, we demonstrate that this outcome is achievable for the problem of learning a multivariate Gaussian distribution $N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$ in the PAC learning setting. Classically, in the advice-free setting, $\tilde{\Theta}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are sufficient and worst case necessary to learn $d$-dimensional Gaussians up to TV distance $\varepsilon$ with constant probability. When we are additionally given a parameter $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}$ as advice, we show that $\tilde{O}(d^{2-\beta}/\varepsilon^2)$ samples suffices whenever $\| \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1/2} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1/2} - \boldsymbol{I_d} \|_1 \leq \varepsilon d^{1-\beta}$ (where $\|\cdot\|_1$ denotes the entrywise $\ell_1$ norm) for any $\beta &gt; 0$, yielding a polynomial improvement over the advice-free setting.</description>

      <title>LLMSteer: Improving Long-Context LLM Inference by Steering Attention on Reused Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) show impressive performance on complex tasks, they still struggle with longer contextual understanding and high computational costs. To balance efficiency and quality, we introduce LLMSteer, a fine-tuning-free framework that enhances LLMs through query-independent attention steering. Tested on popular LLMs and datasets, LLMSteer narrows the performance gap with baselines by 65.9% and reduces the runtime delay by up to 4.8x compared to recent attention steering methods.</description>

      <title>Engagement-Driven Content Generation with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant persuasion capabilities in one-on-one interactions, but their influence within social networks remains underexplored. This study investigates the potential social impact of LLMs in these environments, where interconnected users and complex opinion dynamics pose unique challenges. In particular, we address the following research question: can LLMs learn to generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks?
  To answer this question, we define a pipeline to guide the LLM-based content generation which employs reinforcement learning with simulated feedback. In our framework, the reward is based on an engagement model borrowed from the literature on opinion dynamics and information propagation. Moreover, we force the text generated by the LLM to be aligned with a given topic and to satisfy a minimum fluency requirement.
  Using our framework, we analyze the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in tackling the given task, specifically considering the relative positions of the LLM as an agent within the social network and the distribution of opinions in the network on the given topic. Our findings show the full potential of LLMs in creating social engagement. Notable properties of our approach are that the learning procedure is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. In this regard, our approach can be easily refined for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science.
  The code used for the experiments is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EDCG/.</description>

      <title>Predicting Wall Thickness Changes in Cold Forging Processes: An Integrated FEM and Neural Network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for predicting wall thickness changes in tubes during the nosing process. Specifically, we first provide a thorough analysis of nosing processes and the influencing parameters. We further set-up a Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation to better analyse the effects of varying process parameters. As however traditional FEM simulations, while accurate, are time-consuming and computationally intensive, which renders them inapplicable for real-time application, we present a novel modeling framework based on specifically designed graph neural networks as surrogate models. To this end, we extend the neural network architecture by directly incorporating information about the nosing process by adding different types of edges and their corresponding encoders to model object interactions. This augmentation enhances model accuracy and opens the possibility for employing precise surrogate models within closed-loop production processes. The proposed approach is evaluated using a new evaluation metric termed area between thickness curves (ABTC). The results demonstrate promising performance and highlight the potential of neural networks as surrogate models in predicting wall thickness changes during nosing forging processes.</description>

      <title>SalsaNext: Fast, Uncertainty-aware Semantic Segmentation of LiDAR Point Clouds for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.03653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SalsaNext for the uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation of a full 3D LiDAR point cloud in real-time. SalsaNext is the next version of SalsaNet [1] which has an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder unit has a set of ResNet blocks and the decoder part combines upsampled features from the residual blocks. In contrast to SalsaNet, we introduce a new context module, replace the ResNet encoder blocks with a new residual dilated convolution stack with gradually increasing receptive fields and add the pixel-shuffle layer in the decoder. Additionally, we switch from stride convolution to average pooling and also apply central dropout treatment. To directly optimize the Jaccard index, we further combine the weighted cross-entropy loss with Lovasz-Softmax loss [2]. We finally inject a Bayesian treatment to compute the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for each point in the cloud. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation on the Semantic-KITTI dataset [3], which demonstrates that the proposed SalsaNext outperforms other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks and ranks first on the Semantic-KITTI leaderboard. We also release our source code https://github.com/TiagoCortinhal/SalsaNext.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Detection of Solidarity for Women and Migrants in 155 Years of German Parliamentary Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solidarity is a crucial concept to understand social relations in societies. In this paper, we explore fine-grained solidarity frames to study solidarity towards women and migrants in German parliamentary debates between 1867 and 2022. Using 2,864 manually annotated text snippets (with a cost exceeding 18k Euro), we evaluate large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We find that GPT-4 outperforms other LLMs, approaching human annotation quality. Using GPT-4, we automatically annotate more than 18k further instances (with a cost of around 500 Euro) across 155 years and find that solidarity with migrants outweighs anti-solidarity but that frequencies and solidarity types shift over time. Most importantly, group-based notions of (anti-)solidarity fade in favor of compassionate solidarity, focusing on the vulnerability of migrant groups, and exchange-based anti-solidarity, focusing on the lack of (economic) contribution. Our study highlights the interplay of historical events, socio-economic needs, and political ideologies in shaping migration discourse and social cohesion. We also show that powerful LLMs, if carefully prompted, can be cost-effective alternatives to human annotation for hard social scientific tasks.</description>

      <title>Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning with Exponential Criteria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09010v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning has shown experimental success in a number of applications, it is known to be sensitive to noise and perturbations in the parameters of the system, leading to high variance in the total reward amongst different episodes in slightly different environments. To introduce robustness, as well as sample efficiency, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning methods are being thoroughly studied. In this work, we provide a definition of robust reinforcement learning policies and formulate a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning problem to approximate them, by solving an optimization problem with respect to a modified objective based on exponential criteria. In particular, we study a model-free risk-sensitive variation of the widely-used Monte Carlo Policy Gradient algorithm and introduce a novel risk-sensitive online Actor-Critic algorithm based on solving a multiplicative Bellman equation using stochastic approximation updates. Analytical results suggest that the use of exponential criteria generalizes commonly used ad-hoc regularization approaches, improves sample efficiency, and introduces robustness with respect to perturbations in the model parameters and the environment. The implementation, performance, and robustness properties of the proposed methods are evaluated in simulated experiments.</description>

      <title>Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text classification methods have been widely investigated as a way to detect content of low credibility: fake news, social media bots, propaganda, etc. Quite accurate models (likely based on deep neural networks) help in moderating public electronic platforms and often cause content creators to face rejection of their submissions or removal of already published texts. Having the incentive to evade further detection, content creators try to come up with a slightly modified version of the text (known as an attack with an adversarial example) that exploit the weaknesses of classifiers and result in a different output. Here we systematically test the robustness of common text classifiers against available attacking techniques and discover that, indeed, meaning-preserving changes in input text can mislead the models. The approaches we test focus on finding vulnerable spans in text and replacing individual characters or words, taking into account the similarity between the original and replacement content. We also introduce BODEGA: a benchmark for testing both victim models and attack methods on four misinformation detection tasks in an evaluation framework designed to simulate real use-cases of content moderation. The attacked tasks include (1) fact checking and detection of (2) hyperpartisan news, (3) propaganda and (4) rumours. Our experimental results show that modern large language models are often more vulnerable to attacks than previous, smaller solutions, e.g. attacks on GEMMA being up to 27\% more successful than those on BERT. Finally, we manually analyse a subset adversarial examples and check what kinds of modifications are used in successful attacks.</description>

      <title>A Fusion of Variational Distribution Priors and Saliency Map Replay for Continual 3D Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-image 3D reconstruction is a research challenge focused on predicting 3D object shapes from single-view images. This task requires significant data acquisition to predict both visible and occluded portions of the shape. Furthermore, learning-based methods face the difficulty of creating a comprehensive training dataset for all possible classes. To this end, we propose a continual learning-based 3D reconstruction method where our goal is to design a model using Variational Priors that can still reconstruct the previously seen classes reasonably even after training on new classes. Variational Priors represent abstract shapes and combat forgetting, whereas saliency maps preserve object attributes with less memory usage. This is vital due to resource constraints in storing extensive training data. Additionally, we introduce saliency map-based experience replay to capture global and distinct object features. Thorough experiments show competitive results compared to established methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

Abstract: Various collaborative distributed machine learning (CDML) systems, including federated learning systems and swarm learning systems, with diferent key traits were developed to leverage resources for the development and use of machine learning(ML) models in a conidentiality-preserving way. To meet use case requirements, suitable CDML systems need to be selected. However, comparison between CDML systems to assess their suitability for use cases is often diicult. To support comparison of CDML systems and introduce scientiic and practical audiences to the principal functioning and key traits of CDML systems, this work presents a CDML system conceptualization and CDML archetypes.</description>

      <title>A Confidence-based Acquisition Model for Self-supervised Active Learning and Label Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised neural approaches are hindered by their dependence on large, meticulously annotated datasets, a requirement that is particularly cumbersome for sequential tasks. The quality of annotations tends to deteriorate with the transition from expert-based to crowd-sourced labelling. To address these challenges, we present CAMEL (Confidence-based Acquisition Model for Efficient self-supervised active Learning), a pool-based active learning framework tailored to sequential multi-output problems. CAMEL possesses two core features: (1) it requires expert annotators to label only a fraction of a chosen sequence, and (2) it facilitates self-supervision for the remainder of the sequence. By deploying a label correction mechanism, CAMEL can also be utilised for data cleaning. We evaluate CAMEL on two sequential tasks, with a special emphasis on dialogue belief tracking, a task plagued by the constraints of limited and noisy datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that CAMEL significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of efficiency. Furthermore, the data corrections suggested by our method contribute to an overall improvement in the quality of the resulting datasets.</description>

      <title>Brain-Inspired Efficient Pruning: Exploiting Criticality in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to the energy-efficient and multiplication-free characteristics. Despite these advantages, deploying large-scale SNNs on edge hardware is challenging due to limited resource availability. Network pruning offers a viable approach to compress the network scale and reduce hardware resource requirements for model deployment. However, existing SNN pruning methods cause high pruning costs and performance loss because they lack efficiency in processing the sparse spike representation of SNNs. In this paper, inspired by the critical brain hypothesis in neuroscience and the high biological plausibility of SNNs, we explore and leverage criticality to facilitate efficient pruning in deep SNNs. We firstly explain criticality in SNNs from the perspective of maximizing feature information entropy. Second, We propose a low-cost metric for assess neuron criticality in feature transmission and design a pruning-regeneration method that incorporates this criticality into the pruning process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher performance than the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with up to 95.26\% reduction of pruning cost. The criticality-based regeneration process efficiently selects potential structures and facilitates consistent feature representation.</description>

      <title>VerA: Versatile Anonymization Applicable to Clinical Facial Photographs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for privacy in facial image dissemination is gaining ground internationally, echoed by the proliferation of regulations such as GDPR, DPDPA, CCPA, PIPL, and APPI. While recent advances in anonymization surpass pixelation or blur methods, additional constraints to the task pose challenges. Largely unaddressed by current anonymization methods are clinical images and pairs of before-and-after clinical images illustrating facial medical interventions, e.g., facial surgeries or dental procedures. We present VerA, the first Versatile Anonymization framework that solves two challenges in clinical applications: A) it preserves selected semantic areas (e.g., mouth region) to show medical intervention results, that is, anonymization is only applied to the areas outside the preserved area; and B) it produces anonymized images with consistent personal identity across multiple photographs, which is crucial for anonymizing photographs of the same person taken before and after a clinical intervention. We validate our results on both single and paired anonymization of clinical images through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation. We also demonstrate that VerA reaches the state of the art on established anonymization tasks, in terms of photorealism and de-identification.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models on Graphs: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT4 and LLaMA, are creating significant advancements in natural language processing, due to their strong text encoding/decoding ability and newly found emergent capability (e.g., reasoning). While LLMs are mainly designed to process pure texts, there are many real-world scenarios where text data is associated with rich structure information in the form of graphs (e.g., academic networks, and e-commerce networks) or scenarios where graph data is paired with rich textual information (e.g., molecules with descriptions). Besides, although LLMs have shown their pure text-based reasoning ability, it is underexplored whether such ability can be generalized to graphs (i.e., graph-based reasoning). In this paper, we provide a systematic review of scenarios and techniques related to large language models on graphs. We first summarize potential scenarios of adopting LLMs on graphs into three categories, namely pure graphs, text-attributed graphs, and text-paired graphs. We then discuss detailed techniques for utilizing LLMs on graphs, including LLM as Predictor, LLM as Encoder, and LLM as Aligner, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different schools of models. Furthermore, we discuss the real-world applications of such methods and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude with potential future research directions in this fast-growing field.

      <title>Language Models as Hierarchy Encoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11374v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation of current language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly leveraged these hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit encoding are yet to be explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs), harnessing the expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincar\'e ball with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by training on hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained LMs, standard fine-tuned LMs, and several hyperbolic embedding baselines, focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform all baselines in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Guided Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Regression (UDAR) aims to adapt models from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain for regression tasks. Traditional feature alignment methods, successful in classification, often prove ineffective for regression due to the correlated nature of regression features. To address this challenge, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Alignment (UGA), a novel method that integrates predictive uncertainty into the feature alignment process. UGA employs Evidential Deep Learning to predict both target values and their associated uncertainties. This uncertainty information guides the alignment process and fuses information within the embedding space, effectively mitigating issues such as feature collapse in out-of-distribution scenarios. We evaluate UGA on two computer vision benchmarks and a real-world battery state-of-charge prediction across different manufacturers and operating temperatures. Across 52 transfer tasks, UGA on average outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our approach not only improves adaptation performance but also provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised End-to-End Training with a Self-Defined Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12116v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing algorithms for versatile AI hardware that can learn on the edge using both labeled and unlabeled data is challenging. Deep end-to-end training methods incorporating phases of self-supervised and supervised learning are accurate and adaptable to input data but self-supervised learning requires even more computational and memory resources than supervised learning, too high for current embedded hardware. Conversely, unsupervised layer-by-layer training, such as Hebbian learning, is more compatible with existing hardware but does not integrate well with supervised learning. To address this, we propose a method enabling networks or hardware designed for end-to-end supervised learning to also perform high-performance unsupervised learning by adding two simple elements to the output layer: Winner-Take-All (WTA) selectivity and homeostasis regularization. These mechanisms introduce a "self-defined target" for unlabeled data, allowing purely unsupervised training for both fully-connected and convolutional layers using backpropagation or equilibrium propagation on datasets like MNIST (up to 99.2%), Fashion-MNIST (up to 90.3%), and SVHN (up to 81.5%). We extend this method to semi-supervised learning, adjusting targets based on data type, achieving 96.6% accuracy with only 600 labeled MNIST samples in a multi-layer perceptron. Our results show that this approach can effectively enable networks and hardware initially dedicated to supervised learning to also perform unsupervised learning, adapting to varying availability of labeled data.</description>

      <title>Watermark-based Attribution of AI-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several companies have deployed watermark-based detection to identify AI-generated content. However, attribution--the ability to trace back to the user of a generative AI (GenAI) service who created a given piece of AI-generated content--remains largely unexplored despite its growing importance. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting the first systematic study on watermark-based, user-level attribution of AI-generated content. Our key idea is to assign a unique watermark to each user of the GenAI service and embed this watermark into the AI-generated content created by that user. Attribution is then performed by identifying the user whose watermark best matches the one extracted from the given content. This approach, however, faces a key challenge: How should watermarks be selected for users to maximize attribution performance? To address the challenge, we first theoretically derive lower bounds on detection and attribution performance through rigorous probabilistic analysis for any given set of user watermarks. Then, we select watermarks for users to maximize these lower bounds, thereby optimizing detection and attribution performance. Our theoretical and empirical results show that watermark-based attribution inherits both the accuracy and (non-)robustness properties of the underlying watermark. Specifically, attribution remains highly accurate when the watermarked AI-generated content is either not post-processed or subjected to common post-processing such as JPEG compression, as well as black-box adversarial post-processing with limited query budgets.</description>

      <title>On the Use of Relative Validity Indices for Comparing Clustering Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative Validity Indices (RVIs) such as the Silhouette Width Criterion and Davies Bouldin indices are the most widely used tools for evaluating and optimising clustering outcomes. Traditionally, their ability to rank collections of candidate dataset partitions has been used to guide the selection of the number of clusters, and to compare partitions from different clustering algorithms. However, there is a growing trend in the literature to use RVIs when selecting a Similarity Paradigm (SP) for clustering - the combination of normalisation procedure, representation method, and distance measure which affects the computation of object dissimilarities used in clustering. Despite the growing prevalence of this practice, there has been no empirical or theoretical investigation into the suitability of RVIs for this purpose. Moreover, since RVIs are computed using object dissimilarities, it remains unclear how they would need to be implemented for fair comparisons of different SPs. This study presents the first comprehensive investigation into the reliability of RVIs for SP selection. We conducted extensive experiments with seven popular RVIs on over 2.7 million clustering partitions of synthetic and real-world datasets, encompassing feature-vector and time-series data. We identified fundamental conceptual limitations undermining the use of RVIs for SP selection, and our empirical findings confirmed this predicted unsuitability. Among our recommendations, we suggest instead that practitioners select SPs by using external validation on high quality labelled datasets or carefully designed outcome-oriented objective criteria, both of which should be informed by careful consideration of dataset characteristics, and domain requirements. Our findings have important implications for clustering methodology and evaluation, suggesting the need for more rigorous approaches to SP selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new random walk for uniformly sampling high-dimensional convex bodies. It achieves state-of-the-art runtime complexity with stronger guarantees on the output than previously known, namely in R\'enyi divergence (which implies TV, $\mathcal{W}_2$, KL, $\chi^2$). The proof departs from known approaches for polytime algorithms for the problem -- we utilize a stochastic diffusion perspective to show contraction to the target distribution with the rate of convergence determined by functional isoperimetric constants of the stationary density.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Innovations for Underwater Waste Detection: An In-Depth Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing the issue of submerged underwater trash is crucial for safeguarding aquatic ecosystems and preserving marine life. While identifying debris present on the surface of water bodies is straightforward, assessing the underwater submerged waste is a challenge due to the image distortions caused by factors such as light refraction, absorption, suspended particles, color shifts, and occlusion. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art architectures and on the existing datasets to establish a baseline for submerged waste and trash detection. The primary goal remains to establish the benchmark of the object localization techniques to be leveraged by advanced underwater sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles. The ultimate objective is to explore the underwater environment, to identify, and remove underwater debris. The absence of benchmarks (dataset or algorithm) in many researches emphasizes the need for a more robust algorithmic solution. Through this research, we aim to give performance comparative analysis of various underwater trash detection algorithms.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Spot Beamfocusing: A Correlation-Aware Transfer Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D spot beamfocusing (SBF), in contrast to conventional angular-domain beamforming, concentrates radiating power within very small volume in both radial and angular domains in the near-field zone. Recently the implementation of channel-state-information (CSI)-independent machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been developed for effective SBF using extremely-largescale-programable-metasurface (ELPMs). These methods involve dividing the ELPMs into subarrays and independently training them with Deep Reinforcement Learning to jointly focus the beam at the Desired Focal Point (DFP). This paper explores near-field SBF using ELPMs, addressing challenges associated with lengthy training times resulting from independent training of subarrays. To achieve a faster CSIindependent solution, inspired by the correlation between the beamfocusing matrices of the subarrays, we leverage transfer learning techniques. First, we introduce a novel similarity criterion based on the Phase Distribution Image of subarray apertures. Then we devise a subarray policy propagation scheme that transfers the knowledge from trained to untrained subarrays. We further enhance learning by introducing Quasi-Liquid-Layers as a revised version of the adaptive policy reuse technique. We show through simulations that the proposed scheme improves the training speed about 5 times. Furthermore, for dynamic DFP management, we devised a DFP policy blending process, which augments the convergence rate up to 8-fold.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of self-similarity using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding self-similarity is a key step for understanding the governing law behind complex physical phenomena. Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Integrating Physics of the Problem into Data-Driven Methods to Enhance Elastic Full-Waveform Inversion with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a nonlinear iterative seismic imaging technique that, by reducing the misfit between recorded and predicted seismic waveforms, can produce detailed estimates of subsurface geophysical properties. Nevertheless, the strong nonlinearity of FWI can trap the optimization in local minima. This issue arises due to factors such as improper initial values, the absence of low frequencies in the measurements, noise, and other related considerations. To address this challenge and with the advent of advanced machine-learning techniques, data-driven methods, such as deep learning, have attracted significantly increasing attention in the geophysical community. Furthermore, the elastic wave equation should be included in FWI to represent elastic effects accurately. The intersection of data-driven techniques and elastic scattering theories presents opportunities and challenges. In this paper, by using the knowledge of elastic scattering (physics of the problem) and integrating it with machine learning techniques, we propose methods for the solution of time-harmonic FWI to enhance accuracy compared to pure data-driven and physics-based approaches. Moreover, to address uncertainty quantification, by modifying the structure of the Variational Autoencoder, we introduce a probabilistic deep learning method based on the physics of the problem that enables us to explore the uncertainties of the solution. According to the limited availability of datasets in this field and to assess the performance and accuracy of the proposed methods, we create a comprehensive dataset close to reality and conduct a comparative analysis of the presented approaches to it.</description>

      <title>Embedding-based Multimodal Learning on Pan-Squamous Cell Carcinomas for Improved Survival Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cancer clinics capture disease data at various scales, from genetic to organ level. Current bioinformatic methods struggle to handle the heterogeneous nature of this data, especially with missing modalities. We propose PARADIGM, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that learns from multimodal, heterogeneous datasets to improve clinical outcome prediction. PARADIGM generates embeddings from multi-resolution data using foundation models, aggregates them into patient-level representations, fuses them into a unified graph, and enhances performance for tasks like survival analysis. We train GNNs on pan-Squamous Cell Carcinomas and validate our approach on Moffitt Cancer Center lung SCC data. Multimodal GNN outperforms other models in patient survival prediction. Converging individual data modalities across varying scales provides a more insightful disease view. Our solution aims to understand the patient's circumstances comprehensively, offering insights on heterogeneous data integration and the benefits of converging maximum data views.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Performance Benchmarking on Lightweight Embedding-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the creation of the Web, recommender systems (RSs) have been an indispensable mechanism in information filtering. State-of-the-art RSs primarily depend on categorical features, which ecoded by embedding vectors, resulting in excessively large embedding tables. To prevent over-parameterized embedding tables from harming scalability, both academia and industry have seen increasing efforts in compressing RS embeddings. However, despite the prosperity of lightweight embedding-based RSs (LERSs), a wide diversity is seen in evaluation protocols, resulting in obstacles when relating LERS performance to real-world usability. Moreover, despite the common goal of lightweight embeddings, LERSs are evaluated with a single choice between the two main recommendation tasks -- collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. This lack of discussions on cross-task transferability hinders the development of unified, more scalable solutions. Motivated by these issues, this study investigates various LERSs' performance, efficiency, and cross-task transferability via a thorough benchmarking process. Additionally, we propose an efficient embedding compression method using magnitude pruning, which is an easy-to-deploy yet highly competitive baseline that outperforms various complex LERSs. Our study reveals the distinct performance of LERSs across the two tasks, shedding light on their effectiveness and generalizability. To support edge-based recommendations, we tested all LERSs on a Raspberry Pi 4, where the efficiency bottleneck is exposed. Finally, we conclude this paper with critical summaries of LERS performance, model selection suggestions, and underexplored challenges around LERSs for future research. To encourage future research, we publish source codes and artifacts at \href{this link}{https://github.com/chenxing1999/recsys-benchmark}.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Bi-Focal Perspectives and Granular Feature Integration for Accurate Reliable Early Alzheimer's Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10921v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegeneration, annually diagnosed in millions of patients. The present medicine scenario still finds challenges in the exact diagnosis and classification of AD through neuroimaging data. Traditional CNNs can extract a good amount of low-level information in an image but fail to extract high-level minuscule particles, which is a significant challenge in detecting AD from MRI scans. To overcome this, we propose a novel Granular Feature Integration method to combine information extraction at different scales combined with an efficient information flow, enabling the model to capture both broad and fine-grained features simultaneously. We also propose a Bi-Focal Perspective mechanism to highlight the subtle neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the MRI scans, ensuring that critical pathological markers are accurately identified. Our model achieved an F1-Score of 99.31%, precision of 99.24%, and recall of 99.51%. These scores prove that our model is significantly better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNNs in existence.</description>

      <title>HumanVid: Demystifying Training Data for Camera-controllable Human Image Animation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human image animation involves generating videos from a character photo, allowing user control and unlocking the potential for video and movie production. While recent approaches yield impressive results using high-quality training data, the inaccessibility of these datasets hampers fair and transparent benchmarking. Moreover, these approaches prioritize 2D human motion and overlook the significance of camera motions in videos, leading to limited control and unstable video generation. To demystify the training data, we present HumanVid, the first large-scale high-quality dataset tailored for human image animation, which combines crafted real-world and synthetic data. For the real-world data, we compile a vast collection of real-world videos from the internet. We developed and applied careful filtering rules to ensure video quality, resulting in a curated collection of 20K high-resolution (1080P) human-centric videos. Human and camera motion annotation is accomplished using a 2D pose estimator and a SLAM-based method. To expand our synthetic dataset, we collected 10K 3D avatar assets and leveraged existing assets of body shapes, skin textures and clothings. Notably, we introduce a rule-based camera trajectory generation method, enabling the synthetic pipeline to incorporate diverse and precise camera motion annotation, which can rarely be found in real-world data. To verify the effectiveness of HumanVid, we establish a baseline model named CamAnimate, short for Camera-controllable Human Animation, that considers both human and camera motions as conditions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that such simple baseline training on our HumanVid achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling both human pose and camera motions, setting a new benchmark.

      <title>Coarse Correspondences Boost Spatial-Temporal Reasoning in Multimodal Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly being applied in real-world environments, necessitating their ability to interpret 3D spaces and comprehend temporal dynamics. Current methods often rely on specialized architectural designs or task-specific fine-tuning to achieve this. We introduce Coarse Correspondences, a simple lightweight method that enhances MLLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning with 2D images as input, without modifying the architecture or requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Our method uses a lightweight tracking model to identify primary object correspondences between frames in a video or across different image viewpoints, and then conveys this information to MLLMs through visual prompting. We demonstrate that this simple training-free approach brings substantial gains to GPT4-V/O consistently on four benchmarks that require spatial-temporal reasoning, including +20.5\% improvement on ScanQA, +9.7\% on OpenEQA's episodic memory subset, +6.0\% on the long-form video benchmark EgoSchema, and +11\% on the R2R navigation benchmark. Additionally, we show that Coarse Correspondences can also enhance open-source MLLMs' spatial reasoning (by +6.9\% on ScanQA) when applied in both training and inference and that the improvement can generalize to unseen datasets such as SQA3D (+3.1\%). Taken together, we show that Coarse Correspondences effectively and efficiently boosts models' performance on downstream tasks requiring spatial-temporal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity-Aware Cooperative Federated Edge Learning with Adaptive Computation and Communication Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04022v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the drawbacks of cloud-based federated learning (FL), cooperative federated edge learning (CFEL) has been proposed to improve efficiency for FL over mobile edge networks, where multiple edge servers collaboratively coordinate the distributed model training across a large number of edge devices. However, CFEL faces critical challenges arising from dynamic and heterogeneous device properties, which slow down the convergence and increase resource consumption. This paper proposes a heterogeneity-aware CFEL scheme called \textit{Heterogeneity-Aware Cooperative Edge-based Federated Averaging} (HCEF) that aims to maximize the model accuracy while minimizing the training time and energy consumption via adaptive computation and communication compression in CFEL. By theoretically analyzing how local update frequency and gradient compression affect the convergence error bound in CFEL, we develop an efficient online control algorithm for HCEF to dynamically determine local update frequencies and compression ratios for heterogeneous devices. Experimental results show that compared with prior schemes, the proposed HCEF scheme can maintain higher model accuracy while reducing training latency and improving energy efficiency simultaneously.</description>

      <title>S-MolSearch: 3D Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning for Bioactive Molecule Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual Screening is an essential technique in the early phases of drug discovery, aimed at identifying promising drug candidates from vast molecular libraries. Recently, ligand-based virtual screening has garnered significant attention due to its efficacy in conducting extensive database screenings without relying on specific protein-binding site information. Obtaining binding affinity data for complexes is highly expensive, resulting in a limited amount of available data that covers a relatively small chemical space. Moreover, these datasets contain a significant amount of inconsistent noise. It is challenging to identify an inductive bias that consistently maintains the integrity of molecular activity during data augmentation. To tackle these challenges, we propose S-MolSearch, the first framework to our knowledge, that leverages molecular 3D information and affinity information in semi-supervised contrastive learning for ligand-based virtual screening. Drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport, S-MolSearch efficiently processes both labeled and unlabeled data, training molecular structural encoders while generating soft labels for the unlabeled data. This design allows S-MolSearch to adaptively utilize unlabeled data within the learning process. Empirically, S-MolSearch demonstrates superior performance on widely-used benchmarks LIT-PCBA and DUD-E. It surpasses both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods for AUROC, BEDROC and EF.</description>

      <title>SatFed: A Resource-Efficient LEO Satellite-Assisted Heterogeneous Federated Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional federated learning (FL) frameworks rely heavily on terrestrial networks, where coverage limitations and increasing bandwidth congestion significantly hinder model convergence. Fortunately, the advancement of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks offers promising new communication avenues to augment traditional terrestrial FL. Despite this potential, the limited satellite-ground communication bandwidth and the heterogeneous operating environments of ground devices-including variations in data, bandwidth, and computing power-pose substantial challenges for effective and robust satellite-assisted FL. To address these challenges, we propose SatFed, a resource-efficient satellite-assisted heterogeneous FL framework. SatFed implements freshness-based model prioritization queues to optimize the use of highly constrained satellite-ground bandwidth, ensuring the transmission of the most critical models. Additionally, a multigraph is constructed to capture real-time heterogeneous relationships between devices, including data distribution, terrestrial bandwidth, and computing capability. This multigraph enables SatFed to aggregate satellite-transmitted models into peer guidance, enhancing local training in heterogeneous environments. Extensive experiments with real-world LEO satellite networks demonstrate that SatFed achieves superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>IC3M: In-Car Multimodal Multi-object Monitoring for Abnormal Status of Both Driver and Passengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02592v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Monitoring of Air Pollution Hotspots Using Sparse Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban air pollution hotspots pose significant health risks, yet their detection and analysis remain limited by the sparsity of public sensor networks. This paper addresses this challenge by combining predictive modeling and mechanistic approaches to comprehensively monitor pollution hotspots. We enhanced New Delhi's existing sensor network with 28 low-cost sensors, collecting PM2.5 data over 30 months from May 1, 2018, to Nov 1, 2020. Applying established definitions of hotspots to this data, we found the existence of additional 189 hidden hotspots apart from confirming 660 hotspots detected by the public network. Using predictive techniques like Space-Time Kriging, we identified hidden hotspots with 95% precision and 88% recall with 50% sensor failure rate, and with 98% precision and 95% recall with 50% missing sensors. The projected results of our predictive models were further compiled into policy recommendations for public authorities. Additionally, we developed a Gaussian Plume Dispersion Model to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of hotspot formation, incorporating an emissions inventory derived from local sources. Our mechanistic model is able to explain 65% of observed transient hotspots. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating data-driven predictive models with physics-based mechanistic models for scalable and robust air pollution management in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation for Surgical Scene Segmentation with Anatomy-Aware Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In computer-assisted surgery, automatically recognizing anatomical organs is crucial for understanding the surgical scene and providing intraoperative assistance. While machine learning models can identify such structures, their deployment is hindered by the need for labeled, diverse surgical datasets with anatomical annotations. Labeling multiple classes (i.e., organs) in a surgical scene is time-intensive, requiring medical experts. Although synthetically generated images can enhance segmentation performance, maintaining both organ structure and texture during generation is challenging. We introduce a multi-stage approach using diffusion models to generate multi-class surgical datasets with annotations. Our framework improves anatomy awareness by training organ specific models with an inpainting objective guided by binary segmentation masks. The organs are generated with an inference pipeline using pre-trained ControlNet to maintain the organ structure. The synthetic multi-class datasets are constructed through an image composition step, ensuring structural and textural consistency. This versatile approach allows the generation of multi-class datasets from real binary datasets and simulated surgical masks. We thoroughly evaluate the generated datasets on image quality and downstream segmentation, achieving a $15\%$ improvement in segmentation scores when combined with real images.

      <title>A Closer Look at Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may memorize sensitive or copyrighted content, raising privacy and legal concerns. Due to the high cost of retraining from scratch, researchers attempt to employ machine unlearning to remove specific content from LLMs while preserving the overall performance. In this paper, we discuss several issues in machine unlearning for LLMs and provide our insights on possible approaches. To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning. Experimental results across three scenarios, i.e., fictitious unlearning, continual unlearning, and real-world unlearning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/closer-look-LLM-unlearning.</description>

      <title>t-READi: Transformer-Powered Robust and Efficient Multimodal Inference for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the wide adoption of multimodal sensors (e.g., camera, lidar, radar) by autonomous vehicles (AVs), deep analytics to fuse their outputs for a robust perception become imperative. However, existing fusion methods often make two assumptions rarely holding in practice: i) similar data distributions for all inputs and ii) constant availability for all sensors. Because, for example, lidars have various resolutions and failures of radars may occur, such variability often results in significant performance degradation in fusion. To this end, we present tREADi, an adaptive inference system that accommodates the variability of multimodal sensory data and thus enables robust and efficient perception. t-READi identifies variation-sensitive yet structure-specific model parameters; it then adapts only these parameters while keeping the rest intact. t-READi also leverages a cross-modality contrastive learning method to compensate for the loss from missing modalities. Both functions are implemented to maintain compatibility with existing multimodal deep fusion methods. The extensive experiments evidently demonstrate that compared with the status quo approaches, t-READi not only improves the average inference accuracy by more than 6% but also reduces the inference latency by almost 15x with the cost of only 5% extra memory overhead in the worst case under realistic data and modal variations.</description>

      <title>Is Less More? Exploring Token Condensation as Training-free Adaptation for CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) has shown remarkable generalization ability in image classification. However, CLIP sometimes encounters performance drops on downstream datasets during zero-shot inference. Test-time adaptation methods attempt to mitigate this by adjusting normalization layers or tuning context prompts with large batch sizes and extensive augmentations; yet, these methods are computationally intensive. This raises an important question: Is there a training-free approach that can efficiently address CLIP's performance drop in such cases? To explore this, we benchmark token condensation techniques, originally designed to enhance the efficiency of vision transformers, on CLIP zero-shot inference tasks. We observe that although token condensation may compromise in-domain accuracy, it surprisingly enhances CLIP's performance on certain cross-dataset benchmarks. This motivates two key inquiries: (1) Can token condensation serve as a "free-lunch" solution for CLIP zero-shot inference? (2) What criteria should guide condensation -- how can essential tokens be identified and redundant ones eliminated? To address these questions, we propose Token Condensation as Adaptation (TCA), a training-free adaptation method for CLIP by pruning class-irrelevant visual tokens while merging class-ambiguous tokens. As the first approach for CLIP's token efficiency, TCA demonstrates superior performance across cross-dataset tasks, achieving up to a 21.4\% improvement over the strongest baseline while reducing GFLOPs by 12.2\% to 48.9\%, with minimized hyperparameter dependency.</description>

      <title>RRADistill: Distilling LLMs' Passage Ranking Ability for Long-Tail Queries Document Re-Ranking on a Search Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding the semantic relationships between queries and documents, even with lengthy and complex long-tail queries. These queries are challenging for feedback-based rankings due to sparse user engagement and limited feedback, making LLMs' ranking ability highly valuable. However, the large size and slow inference of LLMs necessitate the development of smaller, more efficient models (sLLMs). Recently, integrating ranking label generation into distillation techniques has become crucial, but existing methods underutilize LLMs' capabilities and are cumbersome. Our research, RRADistill: Re-Ranking Ability Distillation, propose an efficient label generation pipeline and novel sLLM training methods for both encoder and decoder models. We introduce an encoder-based method using a Term Control Layer to capture term matching signals and a decoder-based model with a ranking layer for enhanced understanding. A/B testing on a Korean-based search platform, validates the effectiveness of our approach in improving re-ranking for long-tail queries.</description>

      <title>BiT-MamSleep: Bidirectional Temporal Mamba for EEG Sleep Staging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges in automatic sleep stage classification, particularly the high computational cost, inadequate modeling of bidirectional temporal dependencies, and class imbalance issues faced by Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose BiT-MamSleep, a novel architecture that integrates the Triple-Resolution CNN (TRCNN) for efficient multi-scale feature extraction with the Bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) mechanism, which models both short- and long-term temporal dependencies through bidirectional processing of EEG data. Additionally, BiT-MamSleep incorporates an Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) module and a temporal enhancement block to dynamically refine feature importance, optimizing classification accuracy without increasing computational complexity. To further improve robustness, we apply optimization techniques such as Focal Loss and SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BiT-MamSleep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling long EEG sequences and addressing class imbalance, leading to more accurate and scalable sleep stage classification.</description>

      <title>Quantum Policy Gradient in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parametrised quantum circuits offer expressive and data-efficient representations for machine learning. Due to quantum states residing in a high-dimensional Hilbert space, parametrised quantum circuits have a natural interpretation in terms of kernel methods. The representation of quantum circuits in terms of quantum kernels has been studied widely in quantum supervised learning, but has been overlooked in the context of quantum reinforcement learning. This paper proposes parametric and non-parametric policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms with quantum kernel policies in quantum environments. This approach, implemented with both numerical and analytical quantum policy gradient techniques, allows exploiting the many advantages of kernel methods, including available analytic forms for the gradient of the policy and tunable expressiveness. The proposed approach is suitable for vector-valued action spaces and each of the formulations demonstrates a quadratic reduction in query complexity compared to their classical counterparts. Two actor-critic algorithms, one based on stochastic policy gradient and one based on deterministic policy gradient (comparable to the popular DDPG algorithm), demonstrate additional query complexity reductions compared to quantum policy gradient algorithms under favourable conditions.</description>

Abstract: The non-stationary nature of electroencephalography (EEG) introduces distribution shifts across domains (e.g., days and subjects), posing a significant challenge to EEG-based neurotechnology generalization. Without labeled calibration data for target domains, the problem is a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) problem. For scenarios with constant label distribution, Riemannian geometry-aware statistical alignment frameworks on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold are considered state-of-the-art. However, many practical scenarios, including EEG-based sleep staging, exhibit label shifts. Here, we propose a geometric deep learning framework for SFUDA problems under specific distribution shifts, including label shifts. We introduce a novel, realistic generative model and show that prior Riemannian statistical alignment methods on the SPD manifold can compensate for specific marginal and conditional distribution shifts but hurt generalization under label shifts. As a remedy, we propose a parameter-efficient manifold optimization strategy termed SPDIM. SPDIM uses the information maximization principle to learn a single SPD-manifold-constrained parameter per target domain. In simulations, we demonstrate that SPDIM can compensate for the shifts under our generative model. Moreover, using public EEG-based brain-computer interface and sleep staging datasets, we show that SPDIM outperforms prior approaches.</description>

      <title>Instruction-Guided Editing Controls for Images and Multimedia: A Survey in LLM era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09955</link>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has transformed digital content creation and manipulation. Traditional visual editing tools require significant expertise, limiting accessibility. Recent strides in instruction-based editing have enabled intuitive interaction with visual content, using natural language as a bridge between user intent and complex editing operations. This survey provides an overview of these techniques, focusing on how LLMs and multimodal models empower users to achieve precise visual modifications without deep technical knowledge. By synthesizing over 100 publications, we explore methods from generative adversarial networks to diffusion models, examining multimodal integration for fine-grained content control. We discuss practical applications across domains such as fashion, 3D scene manipulation, and video synthesis, highlighting increased accessibility and alignment with human intuition. Our survey compares existing literature, emphasizing LLM-empowered editing, and identifies key challenges to stimulate further research. We aim to democratize powerful visual editing across various industries, from entertainment to education.

      <title>Prediction-Guided Active Experiments</title>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new framework for active experimentation, the Prediction-Guided Active Experiment (PGAE), which leverages predictions from an existing machine learning model to guide sampling and experimentation. Specifically, at each time step, an experimental unit is sampled according to a designated sampling distribution, and the actual outcome is observed based on an experimental probability. Otherwise, only a prediction for the outcome is available. We begin by analyzing the non-adaptive case, where full information on the joint distribution of the predictor and the actual outcome is assumed. For this scenario, we derive an optimal experimentation strategy by minimizing the semi-parametric efficiency bound for the class of regular estimators. We then introduce an estimator that meets this efficiency bound, achieving asymptotic optimality. Next, we move to the adaptive case, where the predictor is continuously updated with newly sampled data. We show that the adaptive version of the estimator remains efficient and attains the same semi-parametric bound under certain regularity assumptions. Finally, we validate PGAE's performance through simulations and a semi-synthetic experiment using data from the US Census Bureau. The results underscore the PGAE framework's effectiveness and superiority compared to other existing methods.</description>

      <title>ViSTa Dataset: Do vision-language models understand sequential tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using vision-language models (VLMs) as reward models in reinforcement learning holds promise for reducing costs and improving safety. So far, VLM reward models have only been used for goal-oriented tasks, where the agent must reach a particular final outcome. We explore VLMs' potential to supervise tasks that cannot be scored by the final state alone. To this end, we introduce ViSTa, a dataset for evaluating Vision-based understanding of Sequential Tasks. ViSTa comprises over 4,000 videos with step-by-step descriptions in virtual home, Minecraft, and real-world environments. Its novel hierarchical structure -- basic single-step tasks composed into more and more complex sequential tasks -- allows a fine-grained understanding of how well VLMs can judge tasks with varying complexity. To illustrate this, we use ViSTa to evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs, including CLIP, ViCLIP, and GPT-4o. We find that, while they are all good at object recognition, they fail to understand sequential tasks, with only GPT-4o achieving non-trivial performance.</description>
